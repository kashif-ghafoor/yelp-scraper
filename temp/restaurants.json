      "Hands down my favorite restaurant in Miami. Ambiance is upbeat and intimate. Food is AMAZING does not miss in the year I've been going consistently. Service is outstanding .",
      "Amazing steakhouse Our favorite was the the Australian Wagyu which I can only say was perfection. their sides were so perfectly complimentary. Truffle Mac and cheese, the Brussels sprouts, spinach, broccolini and cauliflower were excellent. Beef lettuce wraps were decent, beet salad was good, kids meals were devoured. ALSO if you're here for breakfast their buffet is great",
      "WOW - To say I was completely blown away by my first time dining here would be an understatement. Whether you're celebrating a special occasion or just craving a delectable meal that will leave you speechless, this is the spot that will be sure to leave a lasting impression. From the lavish and trendy decor, the out of this world dishes, beautiful presentations and impeccable service, every detail was taken well into consideration and perfected.I can say with certainty that this is one of the most gorgeous spaces I've ever eaten a meal in. The sultry vibe, elegantly designed interior, endless display of wine bottles scattered throughout the restaurant and the stunning bar will have you feeling like you're in the midst of dining amongst celebrities. There didn't seem to be a bad table to dine at in sight, but my parents and I were lucky enough to snag one of the beautiful half-moon booths toward the center of the room. When is the last time you've been to a restaurant that brings complimentary French fries to the table? And not just any regular ole' French fries, but a delicious trio of French fries each complimented by their own unique dipping sauce? Bet it's probably never happened before, unless you've eaten here. I thought this was such a neat but simple touch that really set them apart from other high-end restaurants. They also bring yummy rolls topped with sea salt to the table (between the fries & the bread, you might end up in a food coma before you even order if you're not careful). I ordered the tuna tartar for an appetizer and I was in heaven every time I took a bite. Not only does it melt in your mouth, but the presentation alone is enough reason to order this (the way they mix it for you makes for a fun video opportunity if you have your phone ready to record). My parents shared a shrimp cocktail that they both enjoyed - The shrimp were massive! Following the appetizers, I munched on a cesar salad which was perfectly dressed. Now... the STEAK. Holy moly, one of the best filet mignons I have had yet. It was ridiculously flavorful, tender & juicy. Melted in your mouth and bursted with flavor. If you're a steak lover, it would be a crime to come here and not order it. The mashed potatoes that accompanied it were also flavorful, but I thought they were a little too runny (my only complaint of the whole meal). If you're a fan of grilled onions, do yourself a favor and order a side of these to top your steak with and thank me later. The \"Smoked Chocolate S'mores\" dessert was ridiculously decadent and was the perfect finish to an impeccable meal. Yes, it's insanely pricy and yes, it's totally worth it. My experience here was one of the best dining experiences I've ever had in Miami - And that says a lot given the fact that Miami is one of the hottest spots in the country for foodies. This restaurant hit it out the park for me and I'm already searching for an excuse to go back to South Florida and to savor new dishes on their menu.",
      "The restaurant is spacious and nice. Bar is nice as well.Staff was friendly and attentive.For appetizers the tuna tartare was fresh and seasoned well.They also bring you French fries 3 different ways with 3 different sauces. I had the certified Angus rib cap cooked medium rare and It was good and flavorful. The side of Mac and Cheese was good as well.",
      "Our favorite was the the Australian Wagyu which I can only say was perfection.",
      "Ambiance was awesome. The dishes, coctails and the dessert were so delicious. All the employees were so polite and friendly. They celebrated our honeymoon with a cute card, it was so nice.They made our special day unforgettable.",
      "Wonderful experience! Fabulous service. Timing, everything was a 10.  Our server really made our night fabulous, she was awesome. Great steak, Mac and cheese with truffle was really nice. Molten cake was super good as well. I must say everything was impeccable.",
      "Phenomenal cuisine. Never have a enjoyed such a succulent and flavourful sea bass - it is one of their renowned specials. But the lack of bones in the fish was made up for by the pained bones in my rear.The decor was beautiful but very far from comfortable. The low chairs were too uncomfortable for eating. The benches; built for slaves.The overall experience was truly hampered by a god awful designer deserving of life in prison for her domestic terror on comfort. 4/5 not bad",
      "This plus is amazing! We had a private room & our server was Erin. Erin was very pleasant, patient, informative & very professional. She suggested several appetizers & dinner. It was our first time visiting this restaurant & it definitely won't be our last.",
      "Food was incredible. I love that when you get to the table instead of getting some bread you get french fries. Service was also impeccable and ambiance is very family friendly in my opinion"

      "I've been coming to this place for the last two years. Best restaurant in Wynwood by far. The menu is very diverse, the service is second to none and the experience will leave you very satisfied. If you're ever in Wynwood hungry, don't think twice.",
      "I loved this spot so much, it's located in the heart of wynwood, there is street parking available. I would recommend for you to make a reservation but they do take walk ins. The ambiance here is great, the DJ spins really good music, they offer hookah, the place is upbeat and definitely a good party vibe.They also offer really good cocktails and appetizers. The service was on point, drinks came out fast and the server was always around.The SNEAKER SHOTS were so cool and you get to keep the sneaker as a souvenir!!!! The CHEESEBURGER DUMPLINGS were so good, the sauce on top was mouth watering, and they give you a good amount for an appetizer. If you're in wynwood and want to have some drinks and grab a few bites with a nice vibe definitely check grails out!",
      "This place is a hidden gem in the Wynwood area.  It has a nice indoor bar and restaurant but the real spot is hanging out in the outside area.  The vibe is crazy with music, sports on TV and the staff running around taking care of guests.We enjoyed a few drinks, our stuff is pretty straightforward some bourbons and vodkas.  They were presented quickly and followed up on with the right timing.  We also had some Poke Nachos that were amazing.  So in my thoughts:Food - CheckDrinks - CheckStaff - another checkSo check this place out if you haven't already.",
      "Came here for some finger food with my hubby. And yes yes and yes. Their wings were HOT and amazing. Their Cesar salad was so good. Had just enough dressing. I couldn't resist not adding shrimp to the salad. Best decision to make. I will definitely be returning for their wings and shrimp Cesar salad. So good! Staff was also amazing and sweet. Thank you Happy New Year",
      "I had a good time here. The space is large and visually appealing, especially if your a sneaker head.   I went with a large group of ladies about 10/12of us.  This place can accommodate and it was still comfortable. Because our large group we basically ate family style.  The portions are a good size and the food was delicious. They had a large space enough to shake a tail feather.Overall a good experience and definitely get a sneaker shot they are so cute",
      "Grails is the perfect happy hour spot with a dope theme.  They have a DJ but the environment is still very chill.  The Guacamole was amazing and the ribs fell off the bone but were also flavorful.   The 88 old fashion is a great drink.  The bar tender/server made it perfectly.  If you're not trying to go to Strip club for happy hour then grails is definitely the best choice.  Thank me later",
      "Came to watch the World Cup, we had breakfast and drinks. Parking is street parking. They have indoor and outdoor seating, lots of screens to watch the game from. I had the chicken and waffles that were pretty good. Fun part they have drinks or shots in a céramique Jordan sneaker you can keep. I of course had to do one! I'll definitely be going back to watch more \"football\".",
      "The appetizer that we ordered were really tasty. But I don't think that for the amount of food you get it's worth the price. It's a bit steep but I get it since their location is trendy and so is the place.  The drinks are actually pretty good and for the price they charge I do think they put a fair amount of liquor. Miriel our server was very attentive and helpful.  Also the Brian the one that brought our food was excellent and kept checking on us and taking our empty dishes away.  The atmosphere and the murals and sneaker theme is dope.  I definitely bought a drink with the Jordan 3 shoe.  You get to take it home. The yuca was a bit hard and burnt. It came with pernil and queso. Tasty but they need to perfect the  yucca and make it crispy. The cheeseburger dumplings were tasty but very small and a few. I don't know if I would come here when it's a full house.",
      "Loved the cool decor, the vibes were nice but the food fell short for me. I was hype to try the cheeseburger sliders but there was nothing special about it. I would've ordered loaded yuca fries or wings but I believed everyone else's hype around it. The Caribbean fufu sliders were good but no wow factor.",
      "Fun and lively environment, we've been here several times. Our most recent outing we were here during Art Basel week for paint/decorate your own shoe event. After the event we caught the Argentina World Cup game, it was a very fun vibe. Good cocktails  and fun music, you'll enjoy your time here."

      "My medianoche sandwich came late after everyone was eating and the cafe con leche was cold so I have to return it.  But having said that, we had a Great service and experience. The staff and manager won me over with their friendliness and attentions and discounting the coffee and the dessert.  I will come back again when I have guest from out of town.",
      "We made our first trip to Little Havana and heard good things about this place. Live music,  Empanadas, and lots of history on Calle Ocho. You can enjoy the open air atmosphere that takes you back to another time. Great variety of Cuban dishes.  The mojito has a sugar cane stick for garnish and extra sweetness if you dare. My husband enjoyed the Cuba Libre. Try the Empanadas. We also had the Media niche sandwich and creme brulee. Remember to have cafe con leche to round out you meal.I can't wait to go back.",
      "First thing is first: I, like many, am very intrigued by the etymology of this restaurant's name. Who is Old? Who was Old? Old's Havana Cuban Bar & Cocina leaves us with many questions and few answers regarding its intriguing name.I went here for lunch on a weekday. This venue certainly leans into its location on Calle Ocho in the center of Little Havana: what, oh what, would the tourists like? Despite its touristy feel, the prices were good and the food was tasty. I had a tender and extremely soft lechón. Not the entire lechón, sadly, but a decent chunk of it served alongside a yuca in mojo and a wee, mediocre salad. The food was quite pleasing overall.Perhaps what was most shocking was my party's naiveté regarding the venue's live music. Midway through our meal, The Band began playing. At 1:45 in the afternoon, not in the night, so it began. We were seated a mere two (2) meters from The Band, and The Band was loud. Volume maxed out. Nothing was heard as nothing could be heard other than The Band and its decent music. Little did we know when we were seated that we'd only be able to converse for half of our meal. It was not the venue for the conversationalist or for conversation. The fault of us or the fault of the Old's Havana Cuban Bar & Cocina or the fault of The Band? Who can say. On this occasion--The Band's quality aside--it made for an unpleasant experience.I would return to Old's Havana Cuban Bar & Cocina, but would strive to sit as far away from The Band as possible. Even in a distant location, The Band and its decent music can be heard and can be heard well.The lechón, although not served on a spit in the way we love to see baby piglets served, is recommended.",
      "Came here for a wonderful Christmas day meal with my family. I had the lofty goal of finding a Cuban place on Christmas in Miami that was open, not an extravagant specialty menu, not totally swarmed, and still delicious. Somehow, we had the good fortune of finding this restaurant which checked every box!The dishes here are very rich and hearty. My favorite of all our orders was the lacon con papas (ham shank). Wonderful flavor and I liked the variety of ingredients. The soup of the day (fish stew) and the plantains were also excellent! My own dish was the lechon asado and to be honest I found it far too salty and was unable to finish. However the rest of the dishes were large enough and yummy enough that it wasn't a problem. There was a band playing live music while we were there -- they were really great, although extremely loud  so that we and the server had to shout at each other to be heard. If there was a bit more separation from hat band that would be perfect. Overall though we enjoyed our experience here and appreciated the attentive service on Christmas day. I would come back and try the sandwiches next time.",
      "Overall we enjoyed this place, but I had to knock down a star for small food portion size.The interior itself is worth visiting this place, they got lots of interesting vintage items, seating, light fixtures and so forth. Looks very cool and very in line with Cuban vibe! Live music is playing right at the front of the place, but it's LOUD. Like, so loud you can't hear person sitting right next to you if you're inside. Luckily there's a huge cozy terrace in the back of the place and that's where we sat.Service was prompt and friendly, our server answered all our questions and came up with suggestions when we weren't sure about what to order.For main dish I went for Picadillo a la Habanera which is a ground beef stew in special sauce with crispy potatoes, it comes with two sides so I got a cup of chicken soup and green plantains. When the food arrived, at first I thought they mixed up the orders. The main dish was served in a tiny iron cast skillet, and when I say tiny I mean tiny. It's very very small. Appetizers are larger than that in most places. So considering the size, $14.5 for this seems a bit high, plus the annoyance that comes with it because I was expecting a standard size dish that'll get me full which is not the case here. Definitely get an appetizer on top of this if you're hungry. That said the dish itself is top notch. Very delicious. Cubano sandwich is also very tasty.I wish I was full after eating here, but it's not like I was going to ask for menu again and wait again for something else to come through. But nonetheless the place is worth visiting!",
      "This is your must see, go to, can't miss spot in Little Havana.Walking in, you feel like you're not in Miami anymore. On top of that, all the team here is super friendly and has great recommendations.It's a spot you HAVE touch check out, because the mojitos are next level delicious. How they make mojitos here, is how a Grade A mojito is supposed to taste. We were lucky enough to get an appearance by some live musicians who made the experience even more immaculate.",
      "I have always wanted to try authentic Cuban food and while visiting Little Havana, I ate at Old's Havana Cuban Bar & Cocina. My goodness, it was absolutely amazing!!!  Fro. The classic mojito, to the tamal and plantains....everything was great!  I started with the Picadillo empanada, tamal en hoja, fried plantains and shrimp tostones. Everything was so flavorful but in my opinion the shrimp tostones just tasted like shrimp in tomato paste. Adding the red sauce helped, but it was my least favorite. Now, the Cuban sandwich...made me cry.  So tender and flavorful.  Paired with fried sweet plantains it was just awesome.  The staff was also on top of everything and kept the table clear as our food quickly came out. I can't wait to come back to try more from the menu.",
      "We had high expectations based on all of the superb reviews. Our initial table was near the front of the building which is tightly spaced and noisy. We moved to the rear yard which we found much more pleasant. My wife requested a medium rare steak which came out raw and very bloody. She returned it and the same bloody mess came out. It was tough but she ate most of it anyway. The black beans are very good as are the drinks which are pricey. We like a few Cuban spots in Jersey better so they get 4 stars, maybe 3.5 stars if it was available.",
      "Amazing mojitos! I tried the classic, aged, coconut, mango and passion fruit - mango was my favorite. For food though, we got the flakita salad, ceviche, ropa vieja, and vaca frita. Everything was tasty, but the ropa vieja was a stand out - suuper tender and flavorful, just a little smaller than we thought it'd be!Cuban coffee was also good, had a small sip of this."

The decor, ambiance inside and outside by the water. At the bar or a table. You're going to get your monies worth from the service to the quality of food. We went for my sister's bday on a Saturday afternoon. It was difficult to get a table for the evening. We each got an entree and with it came with a free appetizer. For drinks we splurged on a bottle of their red Sangria which was delicious! The food was excellent, nothing disappointed. At the end they gave my sister a chocolate cake for her bday and sang her happy bday.",
      "My family and Myself were at Crazy last night and Im not the type pf person that likes to write bad reviews, but sorry not sorry. Im so sick of the food it's 8:02 am and Im not able to leave the bathroom, so glad i didn't order drinks and only had water because I would of have blamed it on the alcohol. Even the croquetas were terribly done, yes!!!! The croquetas!!!! I had pasta and even got the wrong protein, but at the moment the server never came back so I just went for it.So disappointed and so sick I feel terrible that food was the worsts.",
      "Located in the heart of Brickell Miami, this is a sister restaurant & lounge of Dolores.... and three other restaurants in Madrid, Spain. As unique and fun as its name, this water front epicurean delight was the venue for our family dinner to celebrate my baby's sixteen wonderful years of life. From all of the bookmarked restaurants that she viewed, this was her choice and it did not disappoint. Our pre-planned menu consisted of apps such as the BEST Serrano ham croquettes in the world--plus, calamari & pepperoncini flatbread, spring rolls, and cornbread. The salad of choice was baby spinach and quinoa with strawberries and avocados, and our main entree was a nice portion of short rib with veggie fried rice as a side. We also ordered marguerita pizzas for the little ones. The hostesses were professional and sweet. The \"solo service by Andres\" was impressive, and the personal attention by both the manager, Leonardo, and the restaurant owner, Carlos, was very gratifying. Not one detail was overlooked and they didn't skimp--pleasing each member of our party of fifteen. Having friends and family in the industry, we know the ins & outs, as well as the back end. One of the things that stood out was how Andres changed our silverware with every meal brought out, not to mention his genuineness in going above and beyond. What a rock star!To top the evening off, we were served the creamiest, most decadent portions of Spanish cheesecake and they brought out a complimentary piece with a sparkler for our birthday girl! Here are some key notes:1. The restaurant is on the ground floor of The Mark on Brickell condos with a separate entrance. 2. Valet parking is $18-$22. You can also park on the street (PayByPhone or ParkByApp) as available.3. They offer BYOW with a corkage fee of $22/bottle. 4. Reservations are strongly encouraged and you can reserve on Yelp or on the CAY website. 5. Parties of more than 8 must pre-plan through their Events/catering service.",
      "Atmosphere amazing! Service even better and we were pleased with the food. We didn't wait long to be seated and when we were seated they provided blankets to keep us warm. Love this! The spring rolls were delicious!! The margarita pizza was cheesy and crunchy. I didn't like the Filet Mignon but the server was attentive and responded by substituting it for the Miso Glazed Salmon. This dish was both flavorful and robust. The manager even came by and apologized for the food. I was beyond pleased with my experience.",
      "Went there as a last minute dinner for my birthday.Soon as we did valet and went through the door the staff was awesome. Set outside and the weather was just right. I'm a vegetarian and they had a couple decent options for me on the menu I had the artichoke pasta which was really good. The portion size was right and very filling. One of my friends had a burger and I forgot what the other one had (sorry lol) but they both enjoyed their dinners as well. I had the message in a bottle desert and I loved the concept! The waiter we had was great again.Would definitely make the trip from Broward to there one day again.",
      "Above all else, I appreciate the inventiveness of this restaurant's dishes. I can't say every dish was executed with perfection, but I did love their attention to detail and attempt at trying something different. SEARED TORO SALMON - 5/5. SO good! To be honest, the rice texture was way too hard. But it's a small gripe compared to the fish itself, which was seared just enough on the outside to let the inside be nice and tender. I enjoyed that the seasoning also wasn't too heavy so that it didn't overwhelm the salmon but instead let the quality of the fish shine. Highly recommend.I am a big fan of variety, so it is nice that your entree gets paired with a complimentary appetizer.For appetizers -TOSTONE AND BRUSCHETTA - 2/5. Tostone texture was that weird in-between of mushy and crunchy, making it hard to chew, and it had little flavor. The bruschetta was mixed with strawberries, which I don't think mixed well and stood out oddly to me. But I am willing to forgive this dish given the quality of other items we had.SMOKED MAHI MAHI DIP - 4/5. Comes with plantains. Exactly what you think it is. Not as inspiring as their other options but still good.Other general notes -PARKING - found metered street parking. This is downtown, after all.LOCATION - behind the apartment buildings overlooking the ocean. An INCREDIBLE view if you can get outdoor seating :)",
      "This restaurant has a great atmosphere and decent food! You can reserve a table on Yelp or walk in, but outdoor seating will have a long wait normally. Entres come with an appetizer which is a great deal. The calamari flatbread is really good! Tostones and Brushetta didn't have much flavor. Mahi Mahi dip was alright too. For entres we liked the Mushroom Tortellini, Seabass, Miso Glazed Salmon (more cooked salmon), and Seared Toro Salmon (super light and fresh salmon). The restaurant is right on the water so it's beautiful outside. Overall a good place to try out in Brickell!",
      "The food here is so good . The cornbread is definitely the best cornbread I've ever had in my life .  I had the Mexican oxtail tacos they were so good . The sangria is delicious . Our server was very attentive and responsive. I have no complaints and the ocean view was beautiful even at night"

We started with the goat cheese croquettes, which were phenomenal - I could have had two more orders and been done! We moved on to the Salmon A La Plancha for husband and Fresh Florida Mahi for me - both amazing. I might give a slight nod to the salmon, but the mahi was so delicious it's a tough call. We ended the meal with the flan. I was so excited about it we almost missed the photo. Thank you Doce Provisions!",

He gave us great drink/food recs for the night and even gave us a complimentary bday mini cake! We opted to sit outside (which I totally recommend, especially with this great weather we're having!) and enjoyed music and a nice breeze. Looking forward to coming back!",
      "Awesome food and service! Went for the Sunday brunch. Their award winning chorizo croquettes are excellent. Their Celentano which has vaca frita, plantains, black beans, Jasmine rice, fried egg, and chimichurri on top was delicious. Their chicken and waffles with guava sauce and plantains was excellent. The chicken was juicy and moist. Their pan con bister and Cuban sandwich are both excellent. The key lime pie in a jar and flan are both delicious. We weren't able to try their key lime pie waffles and hope to try them in the future.",
      "Took my out-of-town cousin here for her first try of Cuban food.  Ok, it's  not exactly authentic old school Cuban, with the bao buns, chicken waffle and all, but I figure it's good food with quality ingredients.  When we arrived we were a bit concerned about the dining room with not one guest.  To our surprise they took us out the backdoor, through a narrow corridor to the outside patio, where there are actually a few tables of customers enjoying dinner in the lovely Miami winter weather.We really enjoyed the food, especially the Imperial Rice.  I personally found it too cheesy but the flavor is so good.  The girl serving us is really nice and efficient too. The only thing we didn't enjoy nor finish was the Tres Leches, which was rather dry. Definitely a good place to take out of town guests for some experience with Latin American cuisine.",
      "A Little Havana gem!After hearing so many positive things about Doce for years, I finally visited for the first time recently. I went with my out-of-state cousin who wanted a local, trendy, delicious restaurant experience. After walking around Little Havana a bit with our party of 4, I remembered that Doce was nearby, and so we made our way there. Unassuming from the front entrance, Doce is truly a hidden gem. If the weather is nice, ask to sit outside; their backyard outdoor patio is gorgeous and such a surprise!! The menu: omg, so many options. I was salivating as I read the menu. Everything sounded spectacular. How could I possibly choose?!I eventually decided on the goat cheese croquetas to start (I had heard great things about them), and went for the masa de puerco chino (pork fried rice) for the main dish. For drinks, we all decided to order different lemonades (regular, passionfruit, and berry). The fresh-squeezed Cuban-style lemonades were served in cute mason jars and they were vibrant with color. Very insta-worthy. One sip and AH, so refreshing and so much flavor! I took a sip of them all -- they were all so good, definitely among the best lemonades I've ever had. The goat cheese croquetas -- absolutely no regrets. Perfectly crisp croquette balls with soft, creamy cheesy insides; the saltiness of which paired perfectly with the sweet guava marmalade. An excellent choice for appetizer!Now for the entree: absolutely the most spectacular fried rice I've ever had. This is not your average fried rice. The flavor was out of this world. Have you ever had fried rice with the most perfect chicharrones/masitas de puerco? Probably not, unless you've had the one from Doce. A true masterpiece. Delicious. Everyone else was raving about their plates as well. My fiance had the fresh florida mahi which he absolutely devoured, while my cousin had the birria de res quesatacos, and her boyfriend had the ropa vieja. Everyone really loved their dishes. We most definitely will be back!",
      "Delicious! We sat in the lovely patio area out back.  My tip would be to call and make sure live music is playing, and don't assume so just because reviews state there's music. Despite getting just the piped in music, we truly enjoyed it. We started off with a round of local Wynwood blond La Rubia ale, a passion fruit sangria, and a black cherry sangria, and a Havana Kiss made with rum, coco, pineapple and cane syrup. All of the drinks were as delicious as they sounded, and hit the spot.Goat cheese croquettes took our fancy and they were piping hot and perfectly crispy when they came to the table, five round golden brown mounds of tasty cheese surrounded by a great pairing of guava sauce. So good.Two of us ordered the arroz imperial, one friend adding an avocado. Hers came with an entire sliced Haas avocado on the side. The imperial rice dish definitely had its own twist to the classic, as the chicken was braised in beer. A mojo flavored mayo was also added to the dish, along with white cheese. The dish had almost a smoky flavor to it, a wonderful variation to the many times I've tried this dish. I do, however, try to maximize my daily veggies and did notice that they must have been out, as no garden peas were found in tonight's dish.My husband ordered the churrasco. It had been marinated in mojo and a Bonita purée was drizzled on top. It included a warm Japanese truffle bacon ponzu sauce. His dish came with a large portion of tostones and a small mix of greens on the side. I tried the churrasco, before he devoured every last bit, and found it to be bold, tender and delicious. Lastly, we had an order for mahi dish, but with the addition of shrimp to her dish. The mahi was lightly covered in a coconut sauce, and served on top of aji amarillo. That yellow sauce is actually Peruvian, and traditionally includes onions, sweet yellow chili pepper, mayonnaise, sour cream, and queso fresco. The flavors had me wishing for more than just a taste for review purposes. I didn't taste the shrimp, although they looked plump and nicely grilled, sitting on top of that exquisite aji amarillo sauce. The dish also included a salad and a generous scoop of Jasmine rice.Be sure to explore nearby Calle Ocho when you leave!",

      "Doce is probably my favorite restaurant I've tried in little Havana so far! The back patio area is cute and airy even in the heat. The food is flavorful and the waitstaff was excellent! I'll definitely be back to try more of the menu!",
      "I loved this place. I went for a date and the ambience in the back patio makes it perfect. The food was really really good, definitely recommend the birria tacos and the vaca frita tostones, the flavor and food temperature were perfect. We got there really early and found a table really easy but then the place started getting full so I recommend to do a reservation. The service was good. For drinks we had the sangría (a little bit strong but good) and the Cuban beer.",
      "We ordered the chorizo croquetas, imperial arroz, churrasco, salad and Brussels sprouts. All very good!It seems Little Havana has more food options than Cuba!"

We didn't mind the tip being included being that our waitress deserved it. Loved the music selection as well we went for brunch and it got us in a good mood.",
      "Was on holiday over here in Miami and found this place. Decided to come inGentleman who served our table was nice and he was attentive to our needs. Solid serviceThe food was great I enjoyed it. Just a little confused by the bandeja paisa coming with ground beef instead of steak like how it should be traditionally. Unless this is something different I just found it astonishing to have to pay an extra 10 dollars if I wanted it. The plate was already pricey as it is. However, everything was well prepared and the food was good.",
      "Came here for a lovely Christmas dinner. Would recommend getting a reservation ahead of time as the interior of the restaurant is quite tiny (fewer than 10 tables). We were initially worried it was going to be a bit cramped, and it was, but we quickly  forgot about it once the food started coming out. I've never had Colombian food before so it was a real treat. The steak tacos were super yummy and came garnished with onions, guacamole, and herbs. For the entrees, we really enjoyed the skirt steak (chimichurri churrasco), which came with rice and beans. We also tried the Bandeja Paisa (the recommended variety plate) which was flavorful but had a lot more meat than we were expecting. We also ordered some patacones (fried plantains) and papa criolla (potatoes) which helped to round out the meat-heavy meal. In our case, the 2 entrees and 2 sides were enough for 4 people. The service was fast and welcoming - all in all a great meal!",
      "Good spot near the beaches and in the center of South Beach for Colombian classics at a good price.Here are top things you need to know:1. Limited number of tables on the street but more seating is available inside2. Good portion of food to share with friends/family3. Drinks are also pretty good and standard for the South Beach pricing and size4. Staff is super friendly but service is meant to sit down and enjoy your meal so not the place you would want to be in a rush.5. Skip the guac and try other items if you can!",
      "La Ventana was a perfect first meal in Miami. The Columbian cuisine was delicious! So many good meats and sides! It was all so filling and cozy. The mojitos were also on point. Highly recommend!! Hubs got the BANDEJA PAISA ANTIOQUEÑA - Authentic Colombian plate with ground beef, white rice, red beans, sweet plantains, egg, fried pork belly, chorizo or morcilla avocado, and arepita. It was big enough to share for sure!I got the CHIMICHURRI CHURRASCO - Angus skirt steak served with white rice and red beans. I should have asked for more chimichurri, it was so good. Lots of dairy-free and gluten-free options.",
      "Came here with my boyfriend for a date night, excited to try Colombian food. The restaurant itself is small and quaint--quite romantic. The food, however, was inconsistent at best; and the service was saccharine and manipulative. To start with the food: we got the mi tierra, seafood stew (for me), guacamole burger (for him), and chocolate cake for dessert. The mi tierra, though novel and delicious, was $17 for a small portion. The seafood stew was quite well seasoned and large in portion, but nothing particularly special. The chocolate cake was truly awful--it tasted like box mix, and it was $10 for something you could get at your local 7/11 for under $2. The truly abhorrent aspect of our experience, however, was the service. From the very beginning the waitress tried upselling us on everything: upgrade our mimosas from smalls to mediums, upgrade my seafood stew from the regular to the lobster, add a dessert, etc. This was annoying, but we brushed it off at first. When the check came around, however, we noticed that someone covered the \"20% gratuity is included\" with a \"Thank You\" to hide it. This really bothered us because 1) we didn't even feel the service warranted a 20% tip for how manipulative it was up to that point, and 2) covering up the \"20% gratuity included\" note just added to our general feeling of being taken advantage of for being tourists. I understand that the service industry is tough and waitresses are underpaid, etc., but taking advantage of well intentioned customers is not how you resolve these deep rooted issues. Suffice it to say that we won't be back.",
      "Best. meal. I. had. during my birthday trip to Miami Beach!We showed up overdressed (due to aforementioned birthday) to the coziest, most intimate space. They made a table for us immediately and we settled in! Mojitos were delicious! I had the passion fruit and my love had pineapple. I preferred mine because it was more tart than sweet, but I would order both of them again. The sugar cane in the glass is always a good sign!The food was perfect. Just perfection in every way! We started with the empanadas, which I have never had the Colombian style of. I loved the pastry! Nice and crunchy then soft. The spicy salad served with it was incredibly refreshing and the spice was really interesting. Instead of overpowering, it slowly warms your head all over. I adored it. My love had the chimichurri churrasco and I opted for the paella cartagena. HOLY SH*T I cannot tell you how insane this dish is. First of all it's enough food for AT LEAST two people. There's seafood on top and throughout. To me it tasted like the rice was cooked in not only coconut milk but also some seafood stock. I will dream of this dish for years to come! If I ever come back to Miami Beach I will be giving this lovely local place another visit. The service was truly great and we left happy and full",
      "Slow service and food is just fine. All deep fried and taste the same. Drinks are over priced.Also a mandatory 20% service charge, the waitress didn't even mention that the tips are included.Overall, I don't recommend. A restaurant that takes good pictures to attract tourists.",
      "Rating 3.0 TLDR: Overpriced appetizers, overpriced entree (unless you other the American breakfast platter), good service. This might be considered a tourist trap for how much you pay for the food and the ratio and the umami factor. I don't think I'll be coming back Not TLDR: Dont get me wrong, I'm willing to pay for my food; especially if it's GOOD. It was okay here. I did see a lot of people ordering the breakfast platter after I already received my food. American breakfast platter was huge. Maybe that's where the stars went.Anyways, I can't fault them on this. I'm sure their other food is good. Just not good for me; thus the 3 stars.",
      "Amazing vibes and amazing Colombian food! Food and drinks came out quickly and our server Elmer took great care of us. We will absolutely return for him and for the food!"

      "A group of us were in town for a conferences. A coworker asked the concierge at her hotel for a recommendation for dinner. It had pretty good reviews online so we were excited about trying out this Peruvian restaurant. The aesthetic when you walk in is striking. A large part of the seating capacity is outside, but it is done in such a way you barely notice you aren't in a more formal structure. The waiter was very attentive and provided a number of suggestions. One of us got ceviche and I got a rice dish that had chicken, steak, and shrimp (Chaufón De Mariscos). The third in our group got a pasta dish with scallops and shrimp. The cerviche and rice dishes were recommended. Given the high ratings, and the high prices, we had high expectations. All three of us were let down. The cerviche was okay, but not worth the $50 price tag. My rice dish was very heavy on the rice and soy saucue and it felt like a dish I would get a Chinese restaurant. The pasta and seafood dish was okay, but again not a standout. None of the dishes were bad, but none of them were at the level we would ever go back or recommend the restaurant. Even if the dishes weren't so expensive, there just wasn't anything that stood out to me beyond the atmosphere and plantains.",
      "The best! Service was magical, our waiter was very knowledgeable and helpful with all of our questions about ceviche. Cool ambiance. Ceviche was fresh and it melted in my mouth. We ordered the trilogy of ceviches to share- each of them were unique. Unique and surprising flavors. We also ordered Pescado a Lo Macho - the fish was a little dry but the sauce was excellent!! Would recommend and will come back. I would order the same plates again but having tried these and knowing they were so good we will try the rest of the menu. I also ordered a Pisco Inferno - it was warm but with a little more ice it would've been perfect -interesting flavors, I would order again.",
      "CVI.CHE 105 is arguably one of the best Peruvian food restaurants in South Florida.MENU & PRICEIt offers a wide variety of food items and cocktails for every taste. My wife and I ordered a Ña Colada and a Lima En El Coco for drinks. They were excellent. For food, we had the Pulpito Herradura, ceviche and one of the mixed bowls. I mean, WOW!!! The taste and presentation were on point. For dessert, we had the Suspiro de Limeña, and it was also delicious. This place is pricey, but totally worth it. It's a culinary experience! LOCATION & PARKINGThis restaurant is in the middle of the action in downtown Miami, so parking is a bit of a challenge. There is valet parking and some parking garages around, so plan ahead and get ready to pay for parking.Staff was professional and helpful.Overall, 100% recommended.",
      "This place is such a great representation of what Miami's downtown dining vibes are! The aesthetic inside is pleasing to the eye and the dj was great! Our server was a young guy who was nice but was pushing for us not to get chicken which I get where he was coming from but at the same time it almost felt low it was a little too much. We ordered arroz con pollo which comes with papa a la huancaina as well, an order of anticucho and some drinks. Everything was great! It's definitely a place to come for a special occasion or even a night out in the town.",
      "Great ambiance and unique food. Service was wonderful they explained the menu to us and made great recommendations. It did feel like they tried to sell us on the most expensive items... but just be prepared to say no if you don't want to spend an arm and a leg.We started with the papas and the ceviche trilogy. I definitely recommend trying different flavors of ceviche, each so so unique.I split the tacu with my partner which was a great idea because it was heavy. It was wonderful a generous portion with an awesome sauce.Do not skip dessert. The misti was SWEET. But wonderful (best served with coffee) and the coconut flan was decadent.The atmosphere is exactly what people come to Miami for- upbeat, exciting, and unique.As a newcomer to Miami it was a great spot",
      "The best Peruvian restaurant I've ever been to. Every bite will make your mouth sing. Wonderful service. Spectacular ambiance and decor. Unforgettable dining experience.",
      "If you don't come here, did you really go to Miami?! Before you even start to look at the menu, just order the trilogia de ceviche - hands down most delicious ceviche I've ever had. A tip for reservations - I called them at least 10 times to make a reservation and either the phone will keep ringing, or they hang up on you the second they hear you say reservation. So... just make it online :) The interior and ambiance was so warm and so Miami! Fede, our server, was also super funny, lively, accommodating, and just made our overall night!",
      "What is not to love here, from drinks, ceviches, fusion sushi, meats, chaufas, desserts... all amazing! Service is great, ambiance is beautiful, it's clean, offers valet right out front. For those who love ceviche, it's really one of the best places. I highly recommend if you are in the downtown area!"

      "My girlfriends and I (Party of 5) went for Brunch. We had reservations however was told by the hostess we could not be seated because everyone in our party must be present. So we sat at the Bar. 30 minutes had passed and we were hungry so I asked the hostess to seat the 4 of us. We were placed at a small table therefore when our last guest arrived we were cramped. There were open tables large enough to accommodate us.  Approx. 10 mins. after we were seated another group (Party of 8) was seated next to us. However it was only 5 of them. They DID NOT have to wait until all of their party arrived to be seated! How did I know you asked? I overheard their conversation with the hostess. Please let your party know to be on time. Or maybe it just depends on the mood of the hostess seating you.Moving on... Claudia our waitress was very attentive and friendly. She did her best to be accommodating even though the food service was slow. Our food did not come to our table at the same time. Grits was cold. Small portioned ribs for the price. I ordered an Omelette with Vegan Sausage. I wish the sausage was crumbled and mixed in with omelette instead of two dried patties sandwiched between the omelette. I took the patties out and didn't eat them.Yes, I have some positives! The Brussels Sprouts were delicious. Drinks looked amazing! We didn't drink. Very nice ambiance. Loved the photos on the wall. Good for taking selfies and group photos. Great music. Not too loud. Overall, we had an awesome time together despite our individual restaurant experience. Will we or I go back. Hmmm. The jury is still out.",
      "The food is alright/good, BUT...JAVI IS THE BEST WAITER-love your energy and knowledge of each dish. I would come back if I knew we were going to get him every time! I like the art on the wall and outside. If you're looking to take cute pictures- you'll definitely get a good shot/ lighting!",
      "It was very beautiful in there but the waitress didn't attend to us as much. Food was amazing.",
      "Finally made it to this spot and I was so glad I did. Their Cornbread was one of my most favorite dishes! So soft, flavorful and not dry at all. Drizzled with honey it was perfection.Their Short Rib was incredible. So tender, flavorful and it's served on too of cheesy grits. Their Chicken & Waffles was also another great dish.",
      "Hey honey, we're so glad you finally made it in, and what better way to start your brunch than with our signature jalapeño cornbread!!!! We can't wait to see you back at The Hive.",
      "Came here for lunch after running errands. It's been on my list for a while, so I'm glad I was able to make it. It was a week day so it wasn't as busy but there was still a decent sized crowd. I decided to sit at the bar. Everyone at the restaurant seem so nice. I ordered the truffle mac & cheese alongside the chicken & waffles. I opted for red velvet waffles, and let me tell you... I wasn't a fan of the chicken and red velvet waffle together. They both can stand on their own but together the flavors didn't mesh well. It could be because of the way the chicken was marinated. I'll definitely be back.",
      "this is definitely a hotspot for Sunday brunch or if you're just looking for a spot to eat out. When we arrived, it was already packed so we had to wait a good 20 minutes to be seated which was totally fine. It was Sunday. We already knew that it was probably going to be a wait. for brunch I have the sweet check which is their chicken and waffles and a cup of hot chocolate. I did have to ask for more syrup and I wasn't a fan of the sweet chili sauce that was provided so I didn't really use it for the chicken or the waffles. Overall I give this place a eight out of 10 and if I'm ever in Miami again I'd love to give it another go!",
      "Came to Honey Uninhibited on a Friday around lunch time. Had an 11am reservation and thankfully it wasn't too crazy. We were quickly seated. It didn't appear busy but we ended up waiting about 10 mins for a server to acknowledge us and bring us water. Not the biggest issue but def something I wanted to mention to the restaurant, especially for patrons who don't have as much patience. Once our server came, everything was good! She was kind, made some great recommendations and everything was delivered in good time. She was fantastic and very knowledgeable on her recommendations. We had a bunch of things including the expresso martini, French toast, Mac & cheese with short rib. Everything was delicious and I would def recommend this space for anyone in the area.The ambiance was great. They played a 2000's r&b playlist which brought me back! They have ample indoor and outdoor seating.",

      "During my girls trip to Miami for art Basel weekend we found a Cute brunch spot just walking distance away from my hotel . We went around 1:30 pm. We weren't seat right away but  It was packed ,So definitely make a reservation. They have a cute place to take pictures right at the front and the service was good. Host and server. We started with Mimosas . The food was good. We all enjoyed our food. We started with the cornbread. I had the crab omelette . It was good . I really enjoyed it . My sister had the fish and grits , she loved it . I stole some and her fish was really good. My cousin loved her French toast so it's safe the say we all enjoyed it .Would I go back ? If I'm ever on that side of town again. Definitely Should you ? Yes get the fish . Or the crab omelette.",

For starters, love how intimate the restaurant was and it wasn't overly crowded when I went. At first, me and my friend weren't sure what to order. Our server recommended the Frita by Kush and she did not disappoint. The guava jelly was a delicious touch to the burger. If you are a burger lover you MUST add Kush to your list.",
      "This is an unbeatable place.I haven't visited since before the pandemic but if anything has changed is for the better.Quality of service is top notch, the eclectic ambiance and the food. Oh Lord, the food.I tried a new burger called \"french onion burger\" which was not written in the menu yet but my server recommended as a new item. Sweet Baby Jesus! The best burger I've ever had in my life (and I'm a burger person so this should not be taken slightly).20000% recommended.",
      "We tried Kush last night around 7 ish.The restaurant does have cozy patio. The barista who helped us was super pleasant. The menu is filled with salads , burger , starters , and alcoholic beverages.The salad was mediocre honestly , it was not have enough taste , I even did not taste the charcoal chicken.The alligator bites came after our main course. It was chewy and salty , but it was fresh made and caught I believe so.My husband burger came soft and juicy , he really enjoyed it , since he did not share no only one bite with me.",
      "For it, being a packed Friday, we were able to be sat down inside, which was awesome! The food here is always delicious and tasteful. We ordered the frita burger and the burger with pastrami inside of it which I forgot the name of even though I always order it ha ha. They have delicious creamy, garlic, and honey mustard and ketchup that comes with the meal! Lastly, you can't forget the beer because the beer is so so so so so good!",
      "I cannot believe I haven't rated Kush despite me going probably a dozen times, lol. Kush is truly a staple here. It's a vibe you can enjoy on weekends for GNO, for dinner with your partner, or for a solo meal any time of the day. As a burger lover, these always hit the spot and pack a ton of flavor. I love that even though they have a set menu, you can add/remove ingredients and almost end up making it your own. Definitely a staple if you haven't been here already... just go and Thank me later!",

Although they charge $1 for water that I didn't even ask for or drink (insert eye roll emoji) lol I still give them 4 stars. We beat the crowd by going at 6pm. We were greeted and seated immediately. I wish our waiter educated us more on the menu as it was our first visit but she didn't. Luckily the menu gives a good description of what's on each item on the menu. Here's the breakdown:Frita burger - 10/10Angry chef burger- 10/10Sweet potato fries - 10/10Asparagus - 10/10Riot juice drink - 5/10Gator bites - 8/10Brownie sundae - 3/10Service - 9/10Cost - EXPENSIVE **see pictures**",
      "Kush is a favorite spot to pop into that's walking distance for us; added bonus! If you're looking for great craft beer on tap, bar eats with a twist, and organic natural wines this is a solid spot.There's not an official happy hour, which would be another added bonus, but we typically come in that time of day for wine that is about $45/bottle and eats ranging from $10+.Our favorites are the portobello bites and vegan chorizo tacos. I usually get veggies or chips on the side, but being dairy free it makes me happy I have options to eat here. We still haven't scored their alligator bites, but know those go pretty quickly in the day due to high depend.Staff is always friendly and attentive, and the vibe always chill and laid back.",
      "We finally made it to Kush, after having walked by it about a million times.Such a cute little place to grab a drink and some food, that's fit for a bar but better! Being mostly vegan, plant-based pescatarian, it's hard to find a bar we can eat at and drink too! BINGO!I loved being able to try some organic red wine that was a delicious Pinot noir. Next time, I'm digging into the beer selection too.Our server was super nice and helpful, making recommendations and always checking in. Food wise, we are hooked on the chick'n chorizo vegan tacos... we had two orders. The flavors were delicious and the crunch of the shell and chips added the perfect balance to the inside of the tacos.We will be back!",
      "It's been a while since I've eaten here. The quality of food in the current economic times is reflecting. I would come for the Lokal burger. I considered it one of the best around, not anymore. The taste, size and presentation is gone. Not to mention that French fries would accompany the burger. Now you have to pay for them apart. My bill for a burger, fries and a beer, $42.00. Oh and $1.00 for water that I didn't even consume. This place went from a 5 star to a no star. Ambiance is ok."

I was able to get a table during the dinner rush and it wasn't a big problem. I ordered a media noche sandwich which is a a Cuban sandwich except instead of Cuban bread it's made with a sweet bread bun. And it pretty much blew my mind. I could've eaten two orders easy but I didn't want to fill up on just a sandwich. For dessert I got a slice of tres leches, a guava pastry, and a cortadito. The tres leches was good but honestly I've had better, and the cortadito was good it paired well with the sweets because it was bitter. Can't go wrong with coffee and desserts. A whole paragraph just for the guava pastry here. The guava pastry was SO GOOD. I'm from Southern California and there we have a small Cuban bakery chain called Porto's which also sells guava pastries, cheese rolls, potato balls, croquetas, your classic Cuban pastries. Anyway, this guava pastry made Porto's look like garbage!!! I love Porto's and man, this broke my expectation for what a good guava pastry is. Super light and flaky, not too heavy on the guava filling. I really REALLY wanted to order more guava pastries to go but I had to stay on budget . I will 1000% be coming back here next time I come to Miami and next time I'll budget myself some more money to spend here hehe.",
      "We arrived on a Saturday night around 6pm with somewhat of a long wait, I felt like I'm on a Disney Ride - full of anticipation.  Sneaked into the restroom for a quick break and it... needs a little attention.  Our server Wilma, uniformed in Green was a nice lady, rehearsed and generically trained but clearly stressed with amount of patrons coming in.  Service was slow, strange, and chaotic.  Servers were uniformed Green, White, and Black - all with similar functions.  Ie, server was also bussing (this may explain the Job Opening posted out front).Onto the food:Croquette appetizer (6 for $6) was supposedly Ham, Chicken, and Cod.  While they tasted fine seasonally and texturally on the outside, I'm not a fan of meat being blended til it's unrecognizable.Beef tongue entree was the best entree ($18) there.  Well sauced, tender/ fatty.Trying my friends' dishes, the Vaca Frita was just a bit greasy/ dry.  The cuban while large, loaded with meat, lacked the balance of mustard and pickle that was much needed; so twas also dry.I dare say the restaurant should increase the prices just a bit to attract/ pay their employees more so that quality would match it's popularity.",
      "My favorite meal in Miami was the beef tongue at Versailles. it was soooo good! The tongue was tender and fatty and served with moros rice (black beans and rice) and fried plantains. I also had a cuban espresso and a slice of key lime pie - both were very good!We showed up around 3pm on a Wednesday, and still had to wait about 20 minutes for a table. Only indoor seating is available and the check in process was a little chaotic.",
      "After a failed first attempt at getting not just Cuban food, but good Cuban food the night prior (we mistakenly tried to kill two birds with one stone by seeking Cuban food AND being on South Beach - big mistake trying either)... we ended up on Calle Ocho in Little Havana. This place was packed! And because it is such a well known, must try place, they don't do reservations. You just have to show up and stand your ground until you're in. And luckily, it is Miami - so it's not like standing outside is killing you. Some \"locals\" have made remarks like \"this place is too touristy now\" ... some tourists have made comments like \"this is the best food ever\" -- I'm guessing BOTH groups are exaggerating a bit. Bottom line, I went in and had a Media Noche, tostones, fries, cortadito, and a nevilla versailles... and lemme tell ya, ID DO IT AGAIN (here - not South Beach).",
      "I'm going to write this review, but it probably isn't going to change your mind. This place is well known and pretty popular.However, our service was terrible. It started from the time we were being seated. The manager and the hostess were having a conversation as she walked us to our table and not really paying attention to us. Then, the waitress barely looked at us except when she had to. Even down to giving me, the check, she just kind of whipped her arm out and held it out.The food was mediocre. They had a special appetizer of fried seafood. Most of it was bland except for one item but I don't know what it was. My Versailles sandwich (a Cuban with some really thin chorizo slice) was virtually tasteless.I'll never go back.",
      "I think there are better Cuban restaurants in Miami which is why I give 3 stars. My friends visiting had this on their list - I can see why, it is a heavy tourist spot and the wait was 1.5 hours. Not worth the wait at all. The food was lukewarm and was indeed edible just not something I was scraping my plate. I was just a bit confused on what the intended atmosphere is suppose to be here. Reminded me of a Waffle House inside of a Ballroom if that makes sense. Just not comfy and but with such cheap prices makes sense.",
      "I haven't to Miami in years (12 years to be exact) so I had fond memories about this place. However, it was definitely better back then. It's still crowded but the wait isn't that long. I came here on a Saturday night with a group of 4 people. We ordered the vaca frita, the steak, the beef tongue, the Cuban sandwich, and the Cuban flan. The vaca frita was overcooked and dry. The steak was bland. The Cuban sandwich barely had any mustard or pickles. The best dish was the beef tongue or the Cuban flan. The beef tongue was tender and the sauce was flavorful. I don't know what makes it Cuban flan? I was hoping for rum haha. I didn't taste any rum though. Service was friendly though. Would I come back? Probably not since there's so many other Cuban restaurants on the same block."

Although there are nice areas to sit, you do have to go to the bar to retrieve your drink in the lounge area. Definitely a spot to go to before or after dinner",

      "Disappointed isn't the word. I was extremely hyped to try this gorgeous restaurant out but between the slow service and the subpar food, I can't give this more than two stars. My friends and I went for brunch on a Sunday and the beet thing we had was the guacamole and my friend loved her French toast. In fact, I even had to use the hot sauce served with the guac to give my short rib hash some life. The potatoes were over fried, the short rib was seasoned I expected more.",

      "Serena is located on the 2nd floor of Moxy with a great vibe. Blame it on the tourist side of me when swings at a bar sell me on checking it out. :-) We stopped in for an appetizer and drink before beginning our evening, and this place did not disappoint. We had the chips and guac (an easy go to) and the Oysters Serena, which were a pleasant surprise. I'm not crazy crazy about oysters, but I like to try new things while on vacation. This app was among one of the best I had my entire time in Miami. I also had the Sangre de Hombres which had mezcal, ancho Reyes and watermelon.",
      "I loved the swing chairs at the bar! Guacamole and chips were great too! Atmosphere was great!",
      "I met someone here for drinks and this was a super cute spot. I forgot the name of the frozen drink but it was really good and came out pretty quick. The host was extremely welcoming and helpful. Definitely coming back",
      "Omg--my favorite rooftop bar in South Beach! The vibes are immaculate. It's absolutely beautiful and the drinks were all sooo good! It's clear the bartenders here know how to mix a good cocktail. My favorite cocktail was the Sangre des Hombres! (Like a spicy, smoky, watermelon margarita--yum.) The absolute perfect place for date night, happy hour with the girls, special occasions, you name it. Also I'm pretty sure everyone who works here is a 10 (lol). The perfect evening and bar for a nightcap!",
      "What a fun rooftop space for a quick bite and escape from the busy streets below. I had friends arriving sporadically to meet up so I chose a spot at the bar so we didn't drive a server bonkers with our requests. The bartenders were great and attentive for all. The free app for those who stay at the hotel is fresh tortilla chips and three fragrant and spiced to SPICY salsas. From the brunch menu we split up the vegan quesadilla and the short rib hash. The quesadilla was mild and hearty, and the hash... oooooomg this is possibly one of the best short ribs I have ever had. I will be back for more of that thankyouverymuch.",

      "Went here for happy hour on my first night in Miami -- holy cow did this experience set the bar high. Although service was a little slow on a Friday night, the food was fantastic. We did tapa style with a couple of items, in particular the calamari & empanadas were bomb. Does fall on the touristy side since it sits above & is connected to a hotel, but the view is stellar and atmosphere up to par. Check out Caña if you're looking for a quick dinner spot to hit before the night really gets going!",
      "This evening's staff.Kamal Felipe was very helpful, making a deal and charging the phone and he arrived.for the way.The food was great, the live music was fantastic and our servers were top-notch. Thanks to allSo delicious food in our night.",
      "I was in town for a conference and several of us decided to go to dinner. I was looking for tacos but the place I wanted only had a table at 9:00 pm. So I looked for other places near me. I saw Caña and looked at the menu. They had a Miami Spice menu, which me coming from Southern California didn't know about. It is selected items; appetizer, meal, and dessert for a set price. Our server was Daniel, who is so friendly, professional, and ready with suggestions. He is also funny and witty. He suggested a freshly made lemonade with strawberries. It was delicious!!!I ordered as my appetizer, Vieras en Mojo Negro - Pan-seared scallops, black mojo, peppers, onions, tomato, truffle oil, and herbs. For my entree, I ordered Pescado a la Plancha - Grilled fish fillet, garlic, onions, lemon, butter, and fresh herbs. The dessert is the chef's choice and on the night we dined it was Mousse de Chocolate. I had a Cortadito, basically, an espresso shot with milk. I don't do milk but they had almond milk. The price for the dinner is $45, plus whatever drinks you have. I would REALLY recommend Caña. The atmosphere, the food, and the service are for sure five stars. If you can ask for Daniel tell him Daniel from SoCal sent you!",
      "I bookmarked this place to try and had a meal to spare. Initially I was skeptical as it wasn't the cleanest and it was too early not to be but I gave them a mini pass. Cana is located in the Hyatt and I started with a Presidente' beer which I always enjoy and went for the brunch bowl with rice, black beans, fried egg, plantains and fried pork and was not disappointed. Everything was flavorful and well put together. I'd definitely order it again but hope they tidy up more often.",
      "Came on Christmas Day and I'm so glad I did!! Everything from the service to the food was amazing! There was even a jazz player present setting the chill Christmas Brunch vibes, definitely want to come back!!",
      "Very good experience at this restaurant. The food was great and the service by Irka was excellent.",
      "Unreal!! Had an incredible meal on a rainy day and I will be going back whenever I need Cuban food! I got the lechón asado and tostones. It was amazing",
      "Upscale restaurant located in the Hyatt in Brickell. Sat at the bar and received excellent service and recommendations. The drinks were crafted with care and tasted fantastic. The food was exceptional! I would recommend anyone visiting the Brickell area of Miami to make this a stop.",
      "This restaurant is gorgeous and feels spacious, it is bright and unique in decor. The food was great and prices as expected. The only issue is service - absolutely horrible. Nobody every to be found. Whenever we wanted something we had to walk around looking for someone working to tell them and then still wait forever to have them come to your table. How do they do business like that I got no clue."

      "What a beautiful restaurant located in Miami Beach. Parking is easy to find if you go not on a busy day as there is street parking around. You have the option to sit inside or outside, but outside felt so nice, peaceful and beautiful vybes. For the Food. I am beyond impressed with the flavor each item brings. For our appetizer we decided to try the octopus, which by far is the most well cooked octopus I've ever had. I'm really afraid of it ever becoming rubbery and they cooked it to perfection. For the sauce it was a creamy, fresh, acidic vinegrette and it paired well with fresh greens on the side. Entrees: so many to choose from including seafood, fried snapper, churrasco, ribeye, chicken, pasta. We decided to order the seafood stew and the ribeye. I just have to say that seafood stew broth, was the most delicious creamy almost soup like broth we've ever tasted. I started just eating that creamy, flavorful sea food broth. For the seafood stew it comes with rice and tostones and all taste so delicious dipped in that stew. The rib eye was cooked as requested, came with a side of golden potatoes and fresh greens. The ribeye was well seasoned, and even dipped it in thay sea food stew sometimes. Dessert: options including but not limited to, tres leches, Tira misu, chocolate cake, coconut cake and ice cream. The chocolate cake was very well presented and drizzled with fresh chocolate table side. Also comes with a side of ice cream we ate it all. Cocktails include mojitos and margaritas. We tried the blackberry mojito. Which I was beyond impressed, they actually crushed fresh black berry's. So this tasted like a refreshing fruity drink, not to strong , but refreshing. Overall the staff was so sweet, especially Julieta. She was very attentive and so kind. Be sure to check in on yelp for a special surprise!",
      "Thank you so much for sharing your experience with us",
      "What a cute little restaurant in Miami Beach! I love the decor and vibe. Perfect for a date out with the girls. For starters, we ordered the tostones with beef,which was delicious.Full of flavors and the meat was well cooked. Hands down, the best appetizer I've had in a while! For the main course, I ordered the grilled salmon ( Decent size 8 oz), which comes with mashed potatoes and asparagus. My friend ordered the Rib eye ( 12oz), which comes with saute potatoes and mixed salad.Of course the the blackberry mojito was my absolute favorite. So fresh and delicious, perfect for South Beach vibes. If you haven't been here I highly recommend it. If you get lucky, you might be able to find street parking in front of the restaurant. Good thing, there's also a parking garage by in the concer of 7th and Washington.",
      "Thank you very much for your comment, we hope to have you again in our restaurant",
      "tldr: relaxed yet vibey restaurant in Miami Beach that's a great value considering the price, ambiance, quality and quantity of food  FOOD Calamari: flavorful and crispy ! Seafood platter: such a big assortment of different seafood. This could be a great dish to share with some drinks so you get a nibble of everything. Bandeja Paisa: great value and taste! Steak was not too chewy and my boy loved the beans (he's picky about them). Again, another great dish to get a variety of nibbles and if you're not familiar with Colombian food. Tres Leches: creamier than what I'm used to, and smaller than what I expected for the price. However, still would get it again if I was craving because it wasn't overly sweet and was moist. DRINKS Passionfruit and classic mojito: they use a lot of real fruit!! So expect it to not taste like syrup. AMBIANCE There were people here for casual eating, some here for celebrations, and some dressed in work clothes. I did see that they do the whole Miami sparkler thing for birthdays which is always good to note. There's also a good mix of indoor and outdoor seating. Also have a photo op area for cute photos. SERVICE Our server was Paula and she was cheerful and made me feel welcomed. Good service can be hard to find in Miami Beach, so keep this place in mind if you don't want to deal with rough service.",

      "A few weeks ago while parking, we noticed this newish restaurant in a location formerly housing a Vietnamese place. Last night, we thought we'd give it a try. To start with, the waitresses, give a very warm welcome. We chose to sit outside, as did everyone else when we dined. Interestingly, this was a Monday night. By the time we left, the place was full.We followed out waitress, Paola's, recommendations for the entire meal, starting with cocktails - I had the sangria (just right, with lots of fruits), my husband had the passion fruit mojito (loaded with mint). We shared the Caribbean Calamari appetizer; nice a crispy, the garlic aioli had a nice kick to it. Paola recommended the seafood stew to me. It was thick with little clams, mussels, shrimp, fish bits, and crayfish. The sauce was just delicious, perfect for dipping the accompanying tostados in. She strongly recommended the Pescado de Coco a la Samana, a grilled fish filet drenched in a sauce rich with coconut milk, to my husband. We both really enjoyed these choices.We rarely eat dessert, but on Paola's recommendation we tried the special coconut cake, not on the menu. After a kind a rich meal, the cake was light and not overly coconutty. I'd recommend it when you go.Overall, interesting, different food - all delicious, served wonderfully by Paola. Good luck and keep up the excellent food and great service.",

      "Dined on a rainy Tuesday night, ambiance is very intimate and relaxing. Sat on the covered patio. I did get lucky and found street parking in front of the restaurant. We were instantly greeted by a gentleman who was very polite and welcoming. We sat and was greeted by our server - unfortunately I don't remember her name. However she was pleasant and introduced herself and asked recommended some of her favorite items. Food : I started off with the passion fruit mojito. First and foremost the presentation was everything ! We definitely eat with our eyes first and pretty food is my weakness. You can tell that they took their time preparing the drink. The drink was sweet yet refreshing and 10/10 would recommend.For appetizers started off with the beef empanadas. I am a self proclaimed Colombian empanada connoisseur, unfortunately majority of the time they are either too hard, or super greasy or still cold in the middle. These my friends - were perfect. They had a light crisp yet shell yet pipping hot in the middle. They were paired with a green salsa that gave the perfect amount of spice. For the mains : I ordered the Pescado de Coco A la Samana recommended by our server and my friend ordered the bandeja paisa. For the Pescado de coco, it was a piece of fried snapper (you get a choice of fried or grilled), covered in a coconut cream sauce. Served with white rice and green plantains. The dish itself was very, very flavorful. The coconut cream sauce was decadent yet rich. The only thing I would change is for the fish to be lightly sauced. I loveeee saucy things however I would've really like to get the crispiness of the fried snapper with the sauce. Maybe next time I will ask for it lightly sauced with sauce on the side? Overall I would give the item a 8/10.The bandeja paisa 10/10. Everything was juicy and flavorful. The avocado was fresh, the chicharrones were the star as well. Its very easy to overcook a chicharrones but this was crispy yet still chewy on the inside. I could literally eat a bowl of them if I could.For dessert we chose the tres leches. This was chefs kiss !!!!!!!!!!! Not overly sweet with a beautiful strawberry rose on top.Overall had a great experience, place was very instagram friendly as they have a swing with a neon sign in the background, very cute photo op.",
      "Thank Venicia, was a pleasure",
      "Julieta muy amable excelente servicio.  Restaurante 100% recomendado :) Chicharrones",
      "Helloooo 2023! My first review of the new year will be this quaint little restaurant in the heart of Miami! Really a hidden gem tucked away in between restaurants. Our server Paula was very gracious and allowed us to choose anywhere to sit so we chose a corner table next to the mirror and creative floral wall using different mediums. We started off with refreshing libations of strawberry mojito & red sangria. Both well presented and delicious! Our appetizer, we tried the grilled octopus and OH MEE OH MYYYY, that was the most melt in your mouth octopus I've ever had! It was accompanied by a small mixed green salad with the sweetest cherry tomato & the dressing had a texture akin to applesauce and a flavorful tangy taste. We ordered the ribeyes for our entree. It was well prepared, however, I felt that it needed more flavor to standout. The temperature was a little overdone as I ordered medium and it was more medium well, temperature is an important requisite for steak & makes all the difference to the patron. It was surprisingly tender so it didn't take away a star. The ambiance was comfortable and relaxed. They did not have lobster or tiramisu so we ordered the tres leches and which was the highlight to my experience in all honesty. The roasted potatoes was also a favorite with the steak. Wonderful evening on a rarely chilly night in Miami! Cheers to more success in 2023! Gracias!"

      "What an amazing spot, we absolutely LOVED it. It's fairly young and trendy, so I would not take my baby boomer parents here (or a baby in general)- but for a younger, fun, lively crowd, this is perfect. The inside is really cool - lots of artwork, somewhat hidden restaurant, similar to a speakeasy. The drinks were unique and incredible and the food was OUTSTANDING! Very gastronomic - if you're into that sort of thing (my parents wouldn't get it). We basically ordered the entire menu, until we nearly exploded. Here were a few memorable plates (as in, those I can remember after imbibing for a few hours)...Spanglish milk bread - the black salt on top. WOW. They say, once you go black (salt), you never go back right? Exactly. The guava butter was unlike any butter I have ever had. It's very tropical, and fruity! Wagyu beef ravioli - that blue cheese sauce was to die for - take some of that milk bread and drunk your bread in this sauce to your heart's desire (and worry about the consequences later, because bread and cheese, whew!) Nitro Watermelon Tataki - the only remotely healthy thing that entered our mouths at dinner. It's such a cool fish - watermelon, pomegranate seeds, toasted pumpkin seeds, olive oil and a total flavor overload. Not to mention the fact that the fish came out looking like sashimi grade tuna. So cool. Arroz Mamposteado - this was a cool fish. It was rice and beans, but mixed with avocado creme and and pork belly and chips. Incredible. I'm not much of a dessert but holy smokes did we devour the suspiro. I'm quite positive I licked the jar towards the end of the evening - don't judge me. I wish I could remember what cocktail I had, but the choices are all so unique and fun, I should have tried them all. Eh, gives me a reason to go back, right?!",
      "Thank you so much for the kind words and the detailed review of all of our dishes, Shannon.  It was a pleasure hosting you, and we look forward to your next visit!",
      "Obsessed is an understatement.Found this place on Yelp (I love you Yelp!) and with the rating and images I knew I was SOLD. The show stopping, craft cocktails is what I came for and I wasn't sure what to expect once we came. Was it a hype? Would I be disappointed? Who cares! You're in Miami and going to a Spanglish cocktail bar. We didn't make reservations but we did read it wasn't too hard to get in. And it was exactly just that. Came here at around 9:30 pm on a Saturday night and we were seated to the side entrance table with couches right away. It wasn't a good option for dining but we literally only came here for the cocktails so it was perfect!The vibe check in this place was everything. There was a live dj tucked in to the side making sure the music was on point. And it was!On to the craft cocktails:I ordered the Pornstar Mejican@ and it was delicious wish the mezcal was more of the star of the show and to be honest, given that everyone else's cocktails were truthfully visually so pleasing wish the presentation for this one was as well but that's totally ok!!! I still loved my experience. My hubby ordered the Cafetera Old Fashioned and WOW. What a presentation and fun way to serve it with an actual cafetera. It was definitely a show stopper. The Caipirinha Frizá was delicious and very unique as well and the Paparazzi came served in a photo lens so that was pretty cool!We loved Spanglish, would be back in a heart beat. Overall great vibes for cocktails and pretty cool presentation that really makes this place stand out. Excited to try their food next time!",
      "This place gives my New York Vibes OD! It's definitely giving New York Speakeasy Vibes. You'll probably miss it if your not paying attention because the sign outside is only a neon bottle sign. Inside is intimate with the cutest decor, low key, playing all the classic jams. I love a place that sets a vibe with an good playlist! Okayyy! We came for drinks after dinner, so we didn't order food but they did have a menu. All the drinks we ordered were sooo freakin good, and were in creative instagram worthy cups. This is definitely going to be my new hideaway spot. Service was amazing! Will be coming back!",

The food was okay and drinks were pretty good on the other hand, so I think this is a good place for dates, just not a large gathering.",

      "The entrance to Spanglish is so subtle that it's easy to miss! Once you enter, the ambiance is cozy, intimate, and welcoming. We came because of the happy hour -- their cocktails were $9 and some small dishes were marked down! We ordered a round of the caipirinhas first and sadly were a bit disappointed, it was way more tart than expected and just tasted like lemon juice. The Chilcano tasted similar with the overpowering citrus. The Spanglish mule was way better! For small plates, we ordered the octopus croquettes, Caribbean dumplings, and a side of yuca. The octopus croquettes were my favorite of the items we ordered -- crispy, served hot, and the octopus inside was tender. The Caribbean dumplings were a little mushy, and the yuca was a bit tough and the sauce it was served with tasted like Big Mac sauce which I am not a fan of. Everything came out pretty fast, though!",
      "Finally got to visit Spanglish and let's just say I fell in love! I came here for happy hour with a friend and honestly we were blown away by how delicious everything was. We ordered the Spanish Milk Bread, Timba Frita, Queso E' Craba , and Tuna Tostadas. My favorite dish we tried was the Timbra Frita. It was the perfect bite full of flavor. We also ordered cocktails. We both ordered the Paparazzi which honestly tasted amazing but the presentation was killer. It comes served in a camera lens. Overall this place is a vibe. The music was lit. They were playing bad bunny. The artwork is awesome. I definitely see myself coming back here.",
      "Location a bit hidden in plain sight, so be sure to stop and read signs. Small  and intimate setting with a great ambiance for drinks and light bites with friends. The food was ok nothing over the top or extraordinary. I did like my margarita with the seafood bites. Drinks here before a walk around in Wynwood is never a bad idea.",
      "This place has no sign in front. We drive up and down and finally found it. Outside looks like it was closed. Nothing indicating it was opened except for a sign out front that shows menu of the day. We walked it and surprisingly was like wow. This is a cute small cozy restaurant.  The booth I say were pretty close to one another.  The bar area has 6 stools. The food was excellent! Extremely flavorful and so good. The octopus appetizer was amazing. We ordered one of their popular dish and weren't disappointed.  I forgot to photo that dish because I was so hungry.  Everything we had was great including the drinks. We love craft drinks and for sure it was super crafty. The paparazzi drink was so cute. It came in a camera cup and tasted great.I would be definitely coming back here again soon and recommend everyone to try if you haven't been here.",
      "Came here to try a few drinks on a Friday night and it wasn't as busy as I expected. I was able to sit at the bar and watch the bartender make these really cool looking and tasty drinks! The paparazzi was my favorite. Something about the dill and passion fruit combination was something I didn't know I needed. The vuela paloma was just okay, I'm just not the biggest fan of grapefruit. And the cafetera old fashioned tasted like a REALLY strong Cuban coffee, which I really enjoyed. Although the drinks were great, the vibe was kinda ruined by these drunk idiots sitting next to us at the bar, yelling and screaming. But I would still come here again to enjoy a cool curated cocktail."

      "Hands down my favorite restaurant in Miami. Ambiance is upbeat and intimate. Food is AMAZING does not miss in the year I've been going consistently. Service is outstanding .",
      "Amazing steakhouse Our favorite was the the Australian Wagyu which I can only say was perfection. their sides were so perfectly complimentary. Truffle Mac and cheese, the Brussels sprouts, spinach, broccolini and cauliflower were excellent. Beef lettuce wraps were decent, beet salad was good, kids meals were devoured. ALSO if you're here for breakfast their buffet is great",
      "WOW - To say I was completely blown away by my first time dining here would be an understatement. Whether you're celebrating a special occasion or just craving a delectable meal that will leave you speechless, this is the spot that will be sure to leave a lasting impression. From the lavish and trendy decor, the out of this world dishes, beautiful presentations and impeccable service, every detail was taken well into consideration and perfected.I can say with certainty that this is one of the most gorgeous spaces I've ever eaten a meal in. The sultry vibe, elegantly designed interior, endless display of wine bottles scattered throughout the restaurant and the stunning bar will have you feeling like you're in the midst of dining amongst celebrities. There didn't seem to be a bad table to dine at in sight, but my parents and I were lucky enough to snag one of the beautiful half-moon booths toward the center of the room. When is the last time you've been to a restaurant that brings complimentary French fries to the table? And not just any regular ole' French fries, but a delicious trio of French fries each complimented by their own unique dipping sauce? Bet it's probably never happened before, unless you've eaten here. I thought this was such a neat but simple touch that really set them apart from other high-end restaurants. They also bring yummy rolls topped with sea salt to the table (between the fries & the bread, you might end up in a food coma before you even order if you're not careful). I ordered the tuna tartar for an appetizer and I was in heaven every time I took a bite. Not only does it melt in your mouth, but the presentation alone is enough reason to order this (the way they mix it for you makes for a fun video opportunity if you have your phone ready to record). My parents shared a shrimp cocktail that they both enjoyed - The shrimp were massive! Following the appetizers, I munched on a cesar salad which was perfectly dressed. Now... the STEAK. Holy moly, one of the best filet mignons I have had yet. It was ridiculously flavorful, tender & juicy. Melted in your mouth and bursted with flavor. If you're a steak lover, it would be a crime to come here and not order it. The mashed potatoes that accompanied it were also flavorful, but I thought they were a little too runny (my only complaint of the whole meal). If you're a fan of grilled onions, do yourself a favor and order a side of these to top your steak with and thank me later. The \"Smoked Chocolate S'mores\" dessert was ridiculously decadent and was the perfect finish to an impeccable meal. Yes, it's insanely pricy and yes, it's totally worth it. My experience here was one of the best dining experiences I've ever had in Miami - And that says a lot given the fact that Miami is one of the hottest spots in the country for foodies. This restaurant hit it out the park for me and I'm already searching for an excuse to go back to South Florida and to savor new dishes on their menu.",
      "The restaurant is spacious and nice. Bar is nice as well.Staff was friendly and attentive.For appetizers the tuna tartare was fresh and seasoned well.They also bring you French fries 3 different ways with 3 different sauces. I had the certified Angus rib cap cooked medium rare and It was good and flavorful. The side of Mac and Cheese was good as well.",
      "Our favorite was the the Australian Wagyu which I can only say was perfection.",
      "Ambiance was awesome. The dishes, coctails and the dessert were so delicious. All the employees were so polite and friendly. They celebrated our honeymoon with a cute card, it was so nice.They made our special day unforgettable.",
      "Wonderful experience! Fabulous service. Timing, everything was a 10.  Our server really made our night fabulous, she was awesome. Great steak, Mac and cheese with truffle was really nice. Molten cake was super good as well. I must say everything was impeccable.",
      "Phenomenal cuisine. Never have a enjoyed such a succulent and flavourful sea bass - it is one of their renowned specials. But the lack of bones in the fish was made up for by the pained bones in my rear.The decor was beautiful but very far from comfortable. The low chairs were too uncomfortable for eating. The benches; built for slaves.The overall experience was truly hampered by a god awful designer deserving of life in prison for her domestic terror on comfort. 4/5 not bad",
      "This plus is amazing! We had a private room & our server was Erin. Erin was very pleasant, patient, informative & very professional. She suggested several appetizers & dinner. It was our first time visiting this restaurant & it definitely won't be our last.",
      "Food was incredible. I love that when you get to the table instead of getting some bread you get french fries. Service was also impeccable and ambiance is very family friendly in my opinion"

      "Bayshore has the prefect location. Really does! But is majorly lacking on the food, the menu is limited on options, the portions are on the smaller end, and some of the items listed on the menu they no longer offer it. The items that we were able to order were just OK in taste. Its also worth noting that if you are brining kids with you be prepared to feed them a cheese burger cause that's about the only kid friendly option they have. Service was good, we had some wine so can't comment the cocktail. Can I say I've been here Yes, would I say I'm coming back probably not.",
      "The ambiance is great if you sit at the tables by the water.  But if you sit at the tables around the main seating area they serve you the food quickly and you feel a little rushed. I like to come to sit, relax with my husband and enjoy the afternoon, sip drinks and get a bite. It is not fine dining but for my purposes the food is good enough but...if you sit outside you still have to wait for the girls at the front to assign you a table. This particular time we grabbed some chairs outside and ordered drinks at the bar while we waited the hour they promised to get us food service. The hour passed, I could see plenty of empty tables. We asked, they told us they would find out what the wait was, still nothing. Finally i had to go to the girls, tell them we had been waiting over an hour, etc be and all of a sudden a table appeared. Bottom line is food is adequate but i don't think anyone goes there for the food. The atmosphere is good as you can look at the water, be outside, etc but the service and the rules for ordering, tables or the outside seating experience is a mayor fail for me.",
      "Fantastic meal, and incredible experience thanks to our wonderful waitress Kim! She gave great recommendations that did not disappoint--including dishes that were not yet even on the menu! Thank you Kim!",
      "Went for a lunch date with my best friend whose boyfriend recommended the place, and boy, they did not disappoint! We were seated almost immediately, closer to the water in the rear of the restaurant. The host & server were extremely nice. The servers suggestions did not disappoint, he recommended a similar wine to Chianti (since they only serve that by the bottle not the glass), as well as our multiple plates. The espresso martinis were some of the best I've ever had! The ceviche was fresh and I left NO CRUMBS. Nothing, of any of the dishes. We ordered the causa, the broccolini, tuna tacos and coconut rice. I cannot wait to go back to this place.",
      "Came here for happy hour with a couple of friends for on a Friday and it was a very nice time! Happy hour is from 4-6pm and is 50% off most of the drink menu. The atmosphere is very open and has a nice ocean breeze and view. The bar has a lot of space and there are many different seating options around the place as well as ones that are downstairs near the docks and have a sandy area. Our server, Axi, was very friendly and attentive - she did an amazing job making sure that we got everything we needed and fully got to enjoy our evening! We ordered lots of cocktails including the slip, come fly with me, pan american, Marina reef - all were very unique and tasty. We ordered the crab and shrimp cocktail cooler which was good to share. They were out of the blue crab claws, so Axi was able to get us some more stone crabs which was very nice! We also shared the conch fritters which were super yummy! Will definitely be back to try more of their food!",
      "5 stars for location 1 star for bar service Angry female bartender on Jan 1 slamming drinks on the counter,  taking her time cleaning previous customers' glasses, napkins, closing our tabs when asked to keep it open.  Seriously,  quit if you don't like your job,  but don't ruin my Jan 1, lady.",
      "Bayshore Club is located along Regatta Harbor in Coconut grove, with great views from the restaurant right along the water.  We came around 11 am on a Sunday for brunch and didn't wait for a table.  We shared the arepas as a starter which were stuffed with cheese and topped with guava, really good if you like guava. I had the almost traditional benedict & it was very filling with good taste throughout. I think they should add a few items to their brunch menu as they only have 6 options currently.  Nice place to enjoy a relaxing brunch with family or friends. I plan to come back for happy hour soon.",
      "The Best cocktails!!!!!! Super impressive. Great views.This place fills up pretty fast so go early or make a reservation. Plenty of parking and a new garage.*Happy Hour 5-7pm Monday-Friday 1/2 priced beer,wine,& cocktails*",
      "So far, so good. Don't come expecting Scotty's Landing; it's not that. But it is nice. The brunch we came to was delicious and service was decent. They seem to still be ironing out kinks, but the people working have a great attitude and it is very nice to just relax there. The marina next door drives boats right by the place, and those abre a little loud. But you're in a marina area, comes with the territory! I would guess this place is going g to be a hit! I hope they stay around as part of the landscape and keep the food fresh and delicious.",
      "This place was so good, I legit went into a food coma afterwards. The service was exceptional, food... TO-DIE-FOR. It came out on time and you could see that the chef took his time in plating the food nicely--(I'm a sucker for aesthetics). The only thing the server got wrong was the ounces on the size of the whole fried fish. It was A LOT more than she had said--hence the food coma^ haha. Quite pricey location but it is the grove, so you get what you pay for."

      "Giving this place 5 stars for the incredible service and experience we had thanks to our amazing service Collin and Luis that kept checking in on us!Came out in a double date with our awesome friends so we already knew we were gonna have a great time with awesome company. We had early reservations for 7:15pm on a Friday and the restaurant was pretty empty considering it was still early.Collin came, offered us drinks, spoke about the daily specials and truthfully, we didn't think twice about ordering their off the menu \"Mexican mezze\" platter. I can't remember the name but it had the separate dips with freshly fried round yellow corn and blue corn tortillas to dip with.I ordered the double trouble, a tequila and mezcal based drink (my fave) but unfortunately this drink highly disappointed me. I was told it had a little bit of a spice which I LOVE, however, the sweetness overload was the turn off for me. Especially not being able to even feel any smoke from the mezcal. I did send it back to tweak it to just make it spicier to tone down the sweetness, they kindly did that and the drink was better. I will say overall, the drinks here were not anything noteworthy or really stood out for our party of four but that didn't matter because what happened next is what changed out game. Ok, the mezze plate........  WOW, WOW AND MORE WOW! Collin explained the plate to us but he didn't prepare us for our mind to be blown like it was. It consisted of 4 \"dips\": a creamy goat cheese based with a red mole style sauce (that definitely packed a spice to it!), a oaxacan style pumpkin seed hand mulled hummus-esque dip, guacamole with queso fresco and pumpkin seeds PACKED with so much flavor and lastly...the far from basic salsa. WOW. Another oaxacan style salsa filled with smokey flavors far from any other type of salsa I've ever tried. The only downfall here were the whole yellow and blue corn tortillas that were not fully fried and didn't break well. It didn't matter, they quickly changed these for us but we ate them anyway because the dips were SO insanely amazing.We ordered the Ember Roasted Cauliflower which was so delicious and had a gorgeous presentation. Love that this place has options for vegetarians that are just as show stopping as the other dishes. Got the roasted street corn on the side which was pretty awesome!We debated on dessert especially watching those huge churros hit the restaurant floor runway with sparklers but unfortunately we knew the four of us wouldn't be ready for the eat down. So we sadly skipped but they definitely had some interesting desserts like the skull one!! We saw a table order it and it looked so awesome!I love how unrushed and calm this whole experience was. It was a truly memorable dining experience. Love that we were able to be there during the quieter part of the night and enjoy talking and some of our meal while the space transitioned to a more vibey transition with the staff walking around with sparklers and making it so much fun! There were some dancers too which made it a lot of fun and a Chica Nights female DJ which was pretty dope! By the time we were leaving (at 10pm) the place was pretty dark and fully transformed which was awesome. This is definitely a great spot for a night out and just to have a great time. Thank you CHICA Miami for giving us such an awesome experience, we were there for almost 3 hours and had an amazing time! The only thing I would have to say is PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE keep that 4 dip Mezze on the menu, it's a HIT and the chef just threw it out of the park with this one! Also, pleaseeeeeeeee more mezcal on the drinks! We want the smoke!",
      "We came with a large group and had a private space in the back. First off... looooove the decor, I felt like I was traveling to somewhere sultry... super sexy vibes. Great place for a date night or out with friends, definitely worth dressing up for!Food was spectacular, we had a pre-chosen full course meal and every dish yum!! Loved the pulpo especially and the churro dessert Amazing! Presentation was beautiful from dish to drinks and we even had dancers visit our section for a little entertainment. Highly recommend!",
      "I submitted an inquiry for a small company brunch of 10 people, I was told online that someone would get back to me within 24 hrs which no one did.I called today just to get a rude girl named Leilani if that's her real name, she was not helpful at all,  gave me an attitude when I asked her to explain the difference between reserving in the main dining area or doing a private brunch, which she didn't help understand what my best option was , she was so unprofessional with no patience, 0 customer service.  I will be takin my business else where.",
      "Late review (from 10/2022).. Upscale Latin American restaurant in south beach with an amazing vibe. Upon entering, we noticed the bedazzled wall with liquor bottles, surrounded by a hue of yellow light. It was an indoor setting with an outdoor view, so we could see pedestrians walk pass us. We had our drinks, waitress was very kind and knowledgeable. For starters, we got the Wagyu Quesa-Birria Empanada and Asado Negra Arepas as per her recommendation. Both were delicious, came in about 3 pieces each, which wasn't enough for 5 girls at the table. Our main was the Wood Fire Meat Parrillada ($190) to share. Food was really delicious, and it was great that we got to try all the different kinds of meats they offered (lamb and steak were our favorite cuts). One star off because we all left feeling like we could have a few more bites.",
      "Fun, very Miami-centric brunch option. Loud, fun music, comfortable seating, solid service and consistent food with a Latin flare. Not many options for vegetarians or vegans.",
      "I agree with past reviews in that we waited 25-30 minutes for our table past our reservation. There were people ahead of us also waiting. So if you're on a time crunch keep that in mind. Everything we had was good asides from the mashed potatoes. They used a food processor or blender and it had this sticky glue mushy baby food play doh like texture. Very very weird. I had truffle butter which was very pungent. I loved it and took it home to put on something else. In short, for the price point I wasn't particularly wowed. People must come for the ambiance which they had live music, some people were dancing and it feels nice to dress up.",
      "Chica is a vibe! The food was tasty & very trendy, the staff is cool & friendly and the overall experience is pretty great. We came as the kitchen was about to close so we didn't get to order to our heart's content but the food we were able to order didn't disappoint. I had the guacamole and it was delicious smokey goodness. The others at my table enjoyed the sea bass. The drinks here were pretty & effective! There was a good variety, so definitely a reason to circle back!",
      "My friend and I came for brunch on a Saturday. (Very Rainy Saturday might I add) He said he googled it and it looked good. Place is absolutely beautiful they have a parking lot on the side of the restaurant. Didn't make reservation as we just showed up. We were greeted kindly and seated pretty quickly. They sat us towards the kitchen on the couch area right at the end tables not the most comfortable spot I will say.It was pretty quiet this day but still a good experience. Our waiter was prompt and friendly. He gave us some background on the style of the restaurant as it was our first time there. They consider their menu Latin fusion. We got to enjoy the Paisa Bowl and Guava Cereal French toast. We decided to share since I wasn't that hungry. It was the perfect combination of sweet and savory !I will say the paisa bowl was the perfect size but I feel like some may say it's not enough food! (Portioned out for sure) compared to other places ! On social media this place looks like a regular party/brunch place. Seems like people celebrate events here also. I will definitely return to try it out again. Thanks Chica",
      "Thank you Eddika for the thoughtful comments. We look forward to your next visit and please introduce yourself! Kind Regards,Michael",
      "An absolutely amazing, tantalizing savory experience from start to finish.  The ambience and food are worth it. We went to celebrate a birthday and wanted try a new place. We started with cocktails and ended with the most entertaining dessert experience. We started the Peruvian Corvina Ceviche, Guacamole, Asado Negro Arepos and Ember-Roasted PEI Mussels Cazuela. Everything was so delicious, we ordered seconds. The entrees took us to another level. The Pan Riasted Ora King Salmon was a hit at the table.  However, the chef hit it out the park with the Venezuelan Braised Short Rib with Huancaína Mash. The Short Rib was tender, flavorful and cooked perfectly. The flavors were spot on and was perfectly complimented by a glass of Malbec. The dish was loved by all that had it. Dessert is an absolute must because the presentation is picture/video worthy. The Churro Bonquet (reduced velvet churros) was delicious and perfect to share which was complimented by Carajillo (Cortado with Spanish Brandy). Equally delicious was the Marquesa de Chocolate. It you love coffee, then this is a must have too. I look forward to going back.",
      "Stellar feedback, thanks Tina! I will share with the team. Please don’t be a stranger and introduce yourself next time.",
      "I came here on a Friday night to have a nice date night with my wife. We had a reservation for 8:30 and when we arrived we were seated after about a 5 minute wait.Chica has a huge selection of wines and spirits to choose from! I decided to stick to the cocktail and so did my wife. My first cocktail was a bourbon based cocktail, called the Saga Continues. It was delicious!! My wife had the Chica-Rita, which was also delicious! As for food I had the ribs, which are a specialty of the restaurant. They were very tender and flavorful. I highly recommend ordering the ribs if you go to Chica. Overall I give this place 5 ! I had a wonderful time here and I would love to go back!"

      "Wow. Such a nice southern charm for sure. The service was on point from the start to finish, i.e. at the bar, and at the table. Kareem and Dave at the bar were friendly and happy to chat and entertain their guests and answer my endless questions about their cocktail making skills, (thank you for that.) The cocktails were very nicely made and presented. Darin our server for the evening was so professional and sweet. The food was not too shabby either!! We tried their appetizer of green fried tomatoes with the ever-juicy popping pork belly (my fav dish of the evening). For our mains we tried  their fried chicken, which was juicy and crisp and delicious, although with a hefty price tag in my opinion (just ask Joe stones what their price tag is!). We also sampled their St Louis ribs which came beautifully presented incased in a glass vessel with the smoke enclosed, which was presented with a proud flourish from the very hands-on manager. They were notably delicious, but be warned they come alone, with no embellishments added, just Ribs. Again, in my opinion a tad overpriced, even for Miami. You are forced to have a side dish or two. Therefore, we tried their Brussels, which were charred nicely and not overly sweet, like a lot of establishments tend to do. We finished off our meal with their fried Oreos - which were actually surprisingly good. The ice cream that accompanied it was top notice.",
      "This place is a gem, definitely worth going to.  Prompt service, nice décor and ambience and the food was a hit.",
      "Holy moly! I hit the jackpot with this find (thanks for the help, Yelp!). I called ahead and surprisingly was able to secure a reservation for SAT 8:15 pm. We arrived early and sat at the bar for a bit. This place has a beautiful array of Whistle Pig - of course my husband tried a new (to him) flavor  on the rocks - he was very pleased. We were promptly sat at our reservation time. The atmosphere is loud, in a very hip cool vibe kind of way.  The dress code is nice casual+. To start we ordered the (crack) corn bread - this will hook you!  It comes in a small iron skillet covered in whipped butter - the corn bread is sweet and salty with chunks of corn, bacon and a few other delicious ingredients that got me doing my known-for yum-hum. Yes, that's right, I didn't realize until my husband told me that when I eat something that I really like I make yum-noise (\"mmm,  hm, mmm\") - I had no idea I did this, but it is the honest way of my body expressing its satisfaction with certain foods. Anyway, we did not eat all the cornbread - the left over will be eaten with our coffee tomorrow. We didn't want to get too full because we were saving room for our beef rib entree, the unique Mac n cheese, and the Brussels. Absolutely everything was D- LICIOUS. We decided to share, and I was going to cut a piece of the rib, but who needs a knife for this meal, not I - it was that tender. Oh, but wait... this beef sat beautifully in a bed of mashed potato's, with a dark beautiful sweet and tangy gravy accompanied by petite carrots topped with pickled (?) carrots strings paired with these spicy red peppers.  WHAT A PALET PLEASING COMBO OF FLAVORS. Just when I thought that was the best yet, nope I bit into their cheesy and very pleasy macaroni. Last was the Brussels.... I am a lover of the Brussels and I will confirm these Brussels are a must have.  This place is a no -questionable 5 stars. Sorry, no good pics... we saw the food and was hooked on the vision and just ate. Pics were an after thought. They sold out of the key lime just shortly before we ordered it... we weren't in time for the key lime!",

      "I've had recommendations to try Yardbird and it didn't disappoint. We got the chicken and waffles and mac and cheese. The mac was easily my favorite part of the meal. It was creamy, cheesy, and the noodles held the cheese perfectly to have a super cheesy bite. The chicken was crispy, juicy, and seasoned well. I loved the crispiness and savoriness of the waffle as well. I wish we had more people with us to try more menu items. I still can't believe I spent $80 for those two menu items but it was really good and I would go back.",
      "Hello May,Thank you for taking the time to review Yardbird Table and Bar in Miami Beach.We are thrilled to hear that you enjoyed the Chicken and Waffles and the Mac and Cheese!  Those are our favorites too.   I hope you will allow us to host you again soon.Jeremy R MillerOperations Manager",
      "Wow, had not been to Yardbird for a long, long time despite the fact it's right down the street. So we started the New Year with lunch and it was very good. It was an early lunch on Monday, so the restaurant was not real busy. Our server, Alisha, gave us a lot of attention; explaining the menu, refilling the water, and so forth. Thank you.We decided to try a few things and share. Good idea because we were stuffed and could not finish it all. Started with the deviled eggs. Beautiful to look at and delicious. We shared the signature fried chicken. Even the white meat was moist. The photo does not do it justice - crispy and perfectly browned. The side we chose was mac and cheese; so creamy - I wondered what the secret ingredients were. No room for dessert. How thoughtful to provide warm, damp napkins to clean you fingers; fried chicken is finger good, afterall.A very good choice for a leisurely lunch.",

      "My second time at this location and if you are in South Beach it is clearly a must!We started our meal today with the most delicious biscuits with a side of homemade butter and Jam. Then we went to a tiered charcuterie appetizer. Then we moved on to our main courses which we ended up sharing and were amazing. Between our apps and meal our really helpful and attentive server Juliet made sure that she refreshed the silver and plates and never let my water run low (big water drinker) Dinner up next we went with the Lewellyn's Fine Fried Chicken, St Louis Ribs and an order of the Short Ribs with garlic mashed potatos, street corn and Mac and Cheese.  Juliet  brought us a side of Honey hot sauce, and Bourbon Maple syrup. And to finish the meal we went with the newest dessert on the menu. Banana pudding Cheese cake and fried oreos! We left in a food coma from this amazing delicious meal!",
      "If you get a chance to eat at Yardbird it will not disappoint... Amazing everything!We ordered some the best items and it was so good we wanted to back the next day for more! Best Fried chicken, Smoked ribs, Lobster Mac and cheese, oh my! This place is a must!",
      "Really not sure what the hype is about this restaurant with the rather high reviews and recommendation we received to try this place out while visiting Miami. First, service was just ok, not genuinely friendly but somewhat fast. We ordered several appetizers and the chicken (what their known for). We didn't like the deviled eggs because they were heavy on the dill, the biscuits were dry, the corn was decent, the fried green tomatoes were the only thing we liked. The chicken was HORRIBLE!!! It was the tiniest pieces of chicken, lacked flavor, and the meat was super dry!!! I would not recommend wasting your time or money here!",
      "Thank you for your review of Yardbird Table and Bar in Miami Beach.We never like to hear that someone has left unhappy. Most guests give us rave reviews for our food and service.

      "I had a great experience at Yardbird last week! We didn't have a RSVP, but were still able to get seated rather quickly on Sunday  around noon. Our waiter was super friendly and explained the menu and drinks to us.We got the Chicken and Waffles, Lewellyn's Fine Fried Chicken, Smoked Salmon Avo Toast, and the Fried Green Tomato BLT. We also got the blackberry bourbon lemonade, the watermelon sling and watermelon mojito.All the food was amazing! The fried chicken was so juicy and tender, perfectly fried too. The bourbon maple syrup and honey hot sauce went really well with the chicken and waffles. The avo toast had plenty of salmon on top too. I loveed the fried green tomato blt- my first time having fried green tomatoes and it was delicious. I really liked the sauce that was on this tooDefinitely will come back here next time I'm in Miami!",

      "We really enjoyed our brunch here. Our server was fine. She wasn't my favorite. She hovered a little bit until she got a big table and then she wasn't quite attentive enough. Not a big deal, I don't like to complain. She had a lot going on but wasn't my favorite server. Food was delicious. Chicken was crispy, well seasoned, juicy on the inside. Biscuits with the butter and jam were also really good. Flaky, hot, light. Great biscuits. We got the waffles from their specials menu and they were amazing. Didn't even need syrup. The creme brûlée topping was amazing and the whipped cream was clearly made in house. Delicious brunch!",

      "All I have to say is WOW!!!! Our night at House of Food Porn was truly a magical experience.  I have eaten at many different restaurants all over the world, and I have never had a food experience like the one we had here.  To start, the restaurant is tiny.  They only open up 12 seats a night and everyone starts at the same time, so it's a very familial feel.  You are greeted by the host Nikki (who is amazing) and you are sat in a U-shape table, introduced to everyone you are dining with, and given a glass of wine.  From there, a real show begins.  Chef Franco comes out to tell you about himself and how he came to making Shushi, which in it of itself is very interesting.  And then the courses start coming out (many with paired cocktails in beautiful glassware shaped like animals) and you eat before he tells you what you have had.  It makes it fun and really encourages you to open up your palate to flavors you may not otherwise have tasted.  With every course we were blown away by the uniqueness and absolute explosion of flavors.  I couldn't even tell you which Shushi was my favorite as they were all spectacular.If you are ever looking for a truly unique, interactive dining experience full of delicious food, then you MUST try House of Food Porn!",
      "House Of Food Porn is by far one of my favorite restaurants in all of Miami. First of all, the place is tiny and only seats 12 which makes it very intimate. Frank and Nicky create an incredible one-of-a-kind, dining experience. I've been here four times now and have never had a repeat of the same meal -  every time they invent something new.  I can't tell you that everything is my favorite; they experiment and that's what creative people do.  You can't create something amazing without taking some chances. If I was going to have 10 dishes, at least 8-9 would be some of the best things I've ever eaten.  1-2 would still be super interesting, but not my favs.   Everyone had a different favorite and that's  what makes this place so much fun and unique. I wish I could tell you what was in all of the pictures below, but I can't because there is no menu. You are given a masterfully crafted a dish, and use all of your senses to discover what's inside. It's an experience like no other and after you finish, the ingredients are revealed.We ate everything from a unique combination of duck paired with barbecue eel, to lamb paired with caviar. Everything is paired with fantastic wine and cocktails enough that its not a bad idea to Uber.",
      "Let me start with the ambiance and the atmosphere and then work my way to the food. We came upon a very unassuming-looking building in the middle of Little Haiti, but that's the last time we were not amazed by our evening. We were greeted by Nikki, who was our hostess for the night. She knew my wife and I were celebrating our anniversary and greeted us with a very warm smile and sat us at a table that could comfortably seat 10. We had place cards with our names on them in front of our seats and besides my wife and my parents, we were joined by 3 other couples celebrating milestones in their relationships. Upon sitting down, we were served a delicious red blend that never stopped pouring the entire night. It was GOOD! We also got 4 handcrafted cocktails and a bonus one with hazelnut schnapps, which was quite delicious as well.The Chef went on to explain his background and his love of food. How he came up with \"shushi\" based on the way his mother pronounced it, and we really felt like we were invited to a meal in their home.Portions may look a bit small, but I would argue the opposite. It is a ton of food, and I was probably full before the beef, but powered through. And the dessert was absolutely to die for. Chef uses a unique combination of flavors in each roll where you think you might know what you're eating, but you'd be totally wrong. I think I correctly guessed one ingredient through the first 6 courses. One of the rolls even had a flourless chocolate cake in it that completely floored me. They took wonderful care of our family, made us feel at home, kept our glasses full, and showed us a fantastic Sunday night experience. It's obviously not an every week kind of thing, but if you're looking for something completely unique and incredibly delicious, you HAVE to check out House of Food Porn.",
      "Wow!!!  Just wow!! What an Amazing food, cocktail experience.  This place exceeded my expectations- beyond words.  The moment we walked in Niki welcomed us like we were family.  Not one detail was missed!  Personalized name tags, a fresh rose, chocolates, and snack were all ready when we arrived.  The setting is intimate, but super comfortable.  The wine???!!  No idea where it came from but it was wonderful.  Chef Franco came out and  prepared us for what was about to happen.  The \"shushi\" rolls he creates are delicious and orgasmic!! Don't even try to guess what's in it.  Love that he waits to tell you until after you eat it.  Ok so THE COCkTAILS, the glasses??!!!  Can't even begin to describe. Unforgettable meal and experience.  Love the passion!  Well done Franco and Niki.",
      "Rude. Disrespectful. Not worth the hour drive or the hassle. $200-$2300 (no I'm not kidding) for a meal in a run down old shoebox in a bad neighborhood, next to a decrepit hair salon with trash all over the sidewalk and exposed live wires jutting out of the cement. Plus a chaotic free-for-all gravel parking \"lot\" which smells of dumpsters, shared with crumbling houses next door.LITERALLY glorified and overly garnished supermarket sushi intensely exaggerated for absolutely no reason other than to create hype and draw attention. I have huge doubts on the legitimacy of their 5 star reviews.Let's paint the picture of how we got here : Arrived with no reservation, as Yelp and several other websites that lead me to HOFP have no mention of it being required -- it also says price point is low/medium (ha!). Got to the locked door, after waiting outside for a few minutes to be noticed, the poorly dressed disheveled host finally came outside and asked if we had a reservation. When we said no, she laughed at us and said in other words, \"tough luck\" and shut the door in our faces. Really? Great way to encourage customers to actually want to make a reservation. Not even a \"I'm so sorry you didn't know about reservations but let's book you for the future\"..? Man, this really is Miami hospitality. For $2000 a meal, at least brush you hair, honey.Is my money no good to you? If you knew what I spent on restaurants and food in a month, you'd be kicking yourself in the a** for turning me away. I am a habitual customer of places I enjoy and love to support small businesses.We peered through the dirty windows of this storage closet of a restaurant to see a layout of junk furniture setup as a Wal-Mart version of Benihana with christmas lights sloppily strung across the walls and laughed that we didn't waste our time and money on these restaurant charlatans trying to sell us coal while promising diamonds.A restaurant with garbage hospitality that can't keep their outside property clean undoubtedly doesn't care about the inside or their customers. Money hungry corner cutters at it's finest. Go ahead and look how filthy it is behind their back door. AVOID. AVOID. AVOID.",
      "A must go to place in Miami! The service, food, atmosphere, and hospitality was incredible. From beginning to end it was an unforgettable experience. I am a huge foodie and this place did not disappoint. The cocktails were on point and the creativity by the chef on the plates was refreshing. This restaurant surpassed my expectations, I would recommended this restaurant to anyone who is looking for a true culinary food experience in Miami. This restaurant should have been on the Michelin star list!",
      "My wife and I like good food, good service and nice places. We are always looking for something new and tempting. Something that puts you on the edge and then either pushes you over or doesn't live up to the hype. Well, this place certainly met us at the edge and pushed us over the top. Driving to the place makes you skeptical because if you know Miami, you know but everything was chill from parking spot to entrance. You definitely will be surprised upon walking in because it's like you just walked through a portal into what promises to be an interesting experience. The place is cozy,intimate so you are just as much a part of the experience as the food. So upon being greeted by the host, Nikki, who is spectacular, you are shown to your seats. Your seats have name tags and goodies to nibble on upon your arrival. Attention to details jump out at you at every moment. The wine is served up and the fun begins. We got there a little early and had time to talk to our host and were that much more pleased because the feel of the place is like your coming home for a long awaited dinner. Nikki was extremely pleasant always smiling and serving drinks and clearing plates. OMG !!!!! The plates. The food is not traditional sushi but a play on it. We had the 11 course dinner and pairing. The combinations, food textures, flavors and presentation were mind blowing!  The fun part about eating here is all is not as it seems. Again the flavors and combinations were epic.... Chef Franco is really creative and passionate about what he does and it shows, but mostly you can tell this guy is having fun and the energy flows through this cozy atmosphere. I'd really like to thank Chef Franco and Nikki for allowing us to be part of this show. Again the attention to detail, from the glasses you drink out of to the plates you are served on is a 10 out of 10.  I would not do this place justice without commenting on the freshness of his food,presentation and overall flavors!  No pictures of food were done on purpose, I hope the review is enough to make you curious enough to try it out.",
      "This place is incredible! I love looking for unique dining experiences - not just amazing food, but overall amazing experiences and this absolutely fits the bill! I'm already trying to figure out when I can book again... and I live in Seattle. We went here for my friend's birthday before going on a cruise the following day. Chef Franco and the whole group made her evening so amazing that she can't stop talking about it. I think she's on her 6th Instagram story. The unique fusions of food are unparalleled, in my experience. Australian lamb with dates stuffed with goat cheese, wrapped in a home made pasta noodle with ceviche on top? Yes, please. I tried to write down all the unique flavors and combos, but couldn't keep up. The plating was incredible, too! And the cocktails! So incredible! Can't recommend this place enough - perfect for a special event! Just remember, a special event also includes making it through the week. ^_^;",
      "One of the best restaurant experiences I ever had! Chef Franco was beyond incredible, personable, and fun! This is something everyone should try at least once in their life! The menu is different every time and is really catered to the specific group of people joined at the table. The food was absolutely incredible and completely unique to anything I've ever had before! We did the 11 course meal which was great and not too too much food but definitely did not leave hungry. Everything including the drinks was perfectly crafted to make a special dining experience. They personalize the experience for you and even give you take home goodies! The building is a little hidden but easy to get to. Chef Franco and his assistant did an incredible job and I can't wait to come back!!!",
      "From the moment you contact them to schedule your reservation , their attention is beyond other. They truly create an experience for you. Service and attention is what stood out the most for me. The food was delicious. A unique experience that bleeds chefs passion for food and unique creations. There is no set menu EVER, so each time is your very own surprise experience. Yum! My advise is if you're allergic to shellfish or are a picky eater = this is not the spot for you. This is a total must experience for every couple. You will have so much fun !! Take an Uber! Unlimited pouring - cheers!"

      "Authentic, tasty, clean, these are the same folks that were on SW 17 Ave and 5th St. Ask for the off the menu item: fresh, flavourful guacamole with fresh fried chips! On point.$4.00 tacos, my all time favorite are the pork surtido, be ready to bite into different textures of pork parts, worth a try. For the non-adventurous pallets,  I recommend the pork campechanos that are just meat and crushed pork rinds. Other tacos offered are al carbon, al pastor, chicken... and they now offer liquor, so enjoy a Negra Modelo with your food.",
      "Okay, so lately I haven't been able to find good authentic carne asada tacos with real carne asada (I've been getting shredded carne asada, not the same thing) Well I finally found it here!!! Real carne asada tacos!!! So GOOD we ordered 3 more! I definitely recommend if you're looking for some real Authentic Mexican tacos!!",
      "Awesome little restaurant in the heart of little Havana. Awesome traditional tacos. The food and service was exceptional. Highly recommended.",
      "great deals and tacos!Love the carnitas and al pastor! They have a buy the pound option where you can get abunch of meat and tacos. Always delicious and quick service!",
      "The tacos were DELICIOUSSSS !! It's a cozy small spot with great service and amazing traditional tacos. All the tacos were full of flavor with its unique taste !! Sooooo good !!!",
      "I came across this restaurant while I was out and about around Little Havana.  The chips & salsa they brought were delicious and nicely spicy.  I ordered the Quesabirria Tacos, a combination of tacos and a quesadilla with stewed shredded beef inside and consomme for dipping.  It was fantastic.  I was still hungry and ordered a couple Tacos al Pastor, which was also very good.  It came with pickled onions, raw onions, cilantro & lime one the side.  The beer was very cold, the service was friendly and on point.I'll be coming back here and have recommended it to friends.  The only issue is parking which is only on the street and can be challenging at times.  Aside from that, this place is a hidden gem.",
      "This was some of the best food I've had!! Especially the steak burrito, I've never had a burrito like that. The atmosphere was very pleasant and the whole building was neat and clean. Would definitely come back.",
      "Surprisingly one of the few restaurants open late in Little Havana, Miami on a Friday night. The Tacos were a bit smaller than expected. I had a variety of meats - the lengua, carne asada, tripa, pastor, campechano (a bit hard). A side dishes of limes, cilantro, onions, salsa onions made it look fancy. Pollo Quesadilla was extra cheesy with chicken. But it tasted like Taco Bell can make it too. The mild salsa was good. But the other two were crazy spicy. Fresh drinks like the horchata was worth. Jamaica wasn't as good. Loud music at night, a bit lively. Indoor and outdoor seating. Mandatory (18%) tip.",
      "Decent taco place with solid service, and prices are lower if you pay in cash. Parking is a challenge.",
      "We came here at Christmas. The food was wonderful. Enjoyed every bit of it. Please come here if you want to enjoy a good Mexican food."

      "I attended a conference at Intercontinental Miami this week, I can not say enough good things about it!Located right on Biscayne Bay in downtown Miami, minutes away from everything.Walking into the hotel you are greeted with a fresh aroma, clean and vibrant interiors. The lobby atrium has soaring ceilings of glass and an impressive massive stone art piece.There is convenient seating around with plush and stylish furniture.  Nice clusters around for clients to have privacy while working or lounging.Toro Toro is their inhouse restaurant. The pricing of the food is quite substantial price point but delicious. Armando j Febles is the executive chef, he obviously knows what he is doing. Everything I have had from burgers to the grouper has been amazing. I ordered the beef fillet antichucho this evening which is Peruvian aji adobo, chimichurri and charred corn salad for $28. Tiny portion, pretty but tasty. I ordered the Pina colada rum cake which was delicious and my friends ordered the La Bamba. It was a whole presentation! It was a chocolate bowl served with ice cream and awesomeness inside, they lay down paper and smashed the bowl and drizzle three different types of sauces on top. So. Good. They play fun and vibrant music sure to get you in the party mood.All of the employees at the hotel and restaurant where welcoming and friendly and went out of their way to accommodate.It was a great experience, I highly recommend the Intercontinental and Toro Toro.",
      "Terri B, Thank you for taking a moment to review your Toro Toro experience!",
      "I have to say, I was so impressed with the food at Toro Toro. The octopus skewer appetizer was one of the best that I've had. I also really enjoyed their margaritas. The bread that they serve before the meal is some of the best I've ever had (and gluten free!). This atmosphere was dark and romantic. We loved it for our group dinner. There was a fire dancer that came out twice while we were eating and honestly, it sounds a little silly, but it was really really cool. We loved the vibes and would definitely come back.",
      "Mary E., Thank you for visiting us on Fuego Friday! We are thrilled you enjoyed your culinary experience and vibes..we can't wait to welcome you back!",
      "We were very excited about trying this restaurant since it showcases a celebrity chef. However the service was poor. We arrived at opening time at 6pm and ordered right away but it took them an hour and a half to serve the main course. We checked multiple times with our server who tried to be helpful but eventually just gave up coming to our table. The other tables beside us were also waiting just as long and getting annoyed and irritated. The food was okay. Nothing spectacular. It was too bad that the poor service and mediocre food resulted in below average night. Unfortunately we won't be going back here again. Here are some pics of the food below.",
      "I've visited this place plenty of times and it's always so good. The waiters are very attentive. Their empanadas are so so good.",
      "Jenni V, Thank you for the 5-star review!!! Can't wait to have you back again!!",
      "The restaurant is absolutely gorgeous. I would come back here for dinner or just to hang out with friends for a drink or two. The restaurant is inside the hotel. I flew in late and was super hungry before I went to my room and stopped by the the restaurant to have this meal. I had shrimp and fries. The shrimp was delicious; however, I didn't care for the sauce on the fries at all. The food was pricey to be bar food. I think both combined total over $30. The service and ambiance of the restaurant were both great.",

      "Went earlier this week for Miami Spice, a good way to sample their rich menu. We both felt the feeling and the service was the best. We were treated like royalty by the staff. Ambiance was marred  by the music that got louder and louder as the evening continued.We both had the amarillo tuna ceviche. It was delicious, especially the accompanying fresh boniato chips. My husband had the flat iron steak, cooked to perfection. The sauces were interesting, but left something to be desired. However, the line of tendon or connective tissue through the middle of the cut made some of it impossible to eat.I had the Cusco chicken. For me, it was ok. The presentation was beautiful, but sometimes chicken breast dries out. I know on Miami Spice you don't always get what's on the \"real\" menu; that was the case here - chicken breast instead of half of a chicken.The desserts. My husband had the raspberry lime cake; perhaps the touch of lychee was the best taste. I wanted to go here for the pavlova, something I make that the family likes. It's also been featured on lots of tv cooking shows lately. I hunted for the meringue under the inch of whipped cream with no success. And the blueberry compote was unlike any compote I've ever had. I'd say this was a creative interpretation inspired by pavlova. Again, this is something not on the regular menu. I recommend it not find a place on it.So, my rating - good on service, ok on food.",
      "Went last night for a Yelp event.  What to write about first, the company or the food?Well, the food wins.  The welcome cocktail was really good, not to sweet, somewhat citrusy, easy to drink.  Service  was passed appetizers for the evening and the group I was with had lots, served with pleasure.  Each item had a special flavor, each different.  The Hamachi tiradito was light and spicy with citrus.  The ceviche (I forget what fish) really tasty.  I missed the prosciutto/beet offering because I don't eat pork and beets are not on my food plan - it looked good.  The arroz con pollo was served in a tiny little cauldron, cute.  It, too, had a nice kick to it.  I had a hard time with desserts because of my food plan so I passed on the pastellitos de guava.  Everyone at the table liked it.  I tasted the pannacotta, a dish I usually find quite tasteless.  This one was not, very nice though a bit too sweet.Now the company.  You know you go to a Yelp event often by yourself and feeling alone, but everyone is so friendly and interested in you!  What a nice feeling.  There is such a comfortable, enjoyable group and ambiance. Oh course, the tone is set by our Yelp hostess, Diandra - how in the world does she know everyone and make you feel at home!  Thank you Yelp and Toro Toro for introducing us to what you do.  Try Toro Toro for Miami Spice; they will offer different menus in August and September.",
      "We had a wonderful Father's Day brunch here. The brunch buffet was laid out across 2 rooms and there was seafood station (oysters, mussels, shrimp, sushi), omelette station, waffle/pancakes station, and the hot bar with different cuts of steak and assort hot sides. The dessert bar consisted of ~10 different cakes/pies, macaroons, and a chocolate fountain!The food was all pretty great, and the cocktails were fun. They have an unlimited mimosa/bloody mary add-on available to your brunch, or you can order from the regular (creative) cocktail menu.",

      "If you're looking for a sandwich to change your life.. you've come to the right place. My first time at this restaurant was an experience from beginning to end.. I pulled up to the restaurant before they even opened their doors and as soon as it hit 10am, there was already a crowd of 10+ people waiting to order! If that isn't a sign from God to visit this place, then I hope this review convinces you!My order was simple.. i got the pan con bistec with a café con leche at the bar. They also have beers and batidos as a drink option, which I'll have to try next time! The sandwich was served in two pieces accompanied by a red sauce that I used to dip! It was delicious and packed with flavor. And the cafe con leche brought me back to life! I wasn't able to finish it all tbh. I felt myself going into a food coma and decided it was my time to leave haha. One thing I noticed was that I didn't wait long to receive my order, given how busy it was! I recommend this place to anyone who's looking for a good quality sandwich that won't break the bank. Perfect for breakfast and/or lunch. You can definitely save the second half of your sandwich for later unless you're really hungry! Both my items were under $20 including tip.",
      "I thought I was going to wait a few days to think things through on this one, but I realized it is what it is. Having grown up in NYC, and being accustomed to Cubans from the Dominican spot or cuchifritos, I'm really torn here. The Cubans in NY are freaking delicious. The Cuban from  Sanquich is \"different\"- the bread is traditional Cuban bread, and has this airiness that I did like. The filling was paper thin pieces of ham and very few pieces of pernil; of course it had pickles, mustard and Swiss to complete the sandwich. The meats combined were very melt in your mouth, rather than a substantial bite if that's your thing (it is mine). So, I won't say I disliked it, but I won't say I'd wait another hr in line for this one. My husband shared the same sentiment. We absolutely loved the cafecito and the croquettes! Croquettes are the perfect balance of crunchy, creamy, and smokey goodness! Service was pleasant and organized",
      "100% came here for the Cuban Sandwich.  Weekend visit to Miami and we did some research for best Cuban Sandwich when we walked around Calle Ocho in Little Havana. Sanguich was the top rated based on our research and it did not disappoint. We ordered the Cubano Sandwich and order of ham croquettes.  The Cubano was loaded with Ham, Pork, pickles, cheese and mustard on Cuban Bread.  First few bites were great and then the owner came by and told us to try some House Made Garlic Sauce.  Wow.  Amazing and highly recommend adding.  Croquettes were Pretty good too. The place was packed and vibrant. Line gets HUGE, so get there early if you want to avoid the wait.",
      "I am honestly ashamed that I never tried this place when I lived in Miami, I was literally 5 minutes away from heaven wrapped in pan cubano. Alas, now being listed on the Michelin bib gourmand this place gets busy.Yes the prices here are higher than most on calle ocho but it is worth it and the lines out the front door prove it. I got the pan con bistec ($15) and omg, the meat, the cheese, the toppings, the bread, everything was perfecto. I'm talking fresh, juicy and delicious.The place is done up really well with a retro 1920s vibe,  all inside an un-assuming strip mall. You might luck out with one of the few free spots in the center or take one of the metered street spots. But parking in Miami is always a mission, nothing new there.",
      "This was our first stop in trying cuban sandwiches in Little Havana and this is a tough one to beat. The vibes were elevated, sandwich was so yummy and warm, and the folks behind the counter were super sweet.The bata de timbal was the recommendation from the team at Sanguich. It's a milkshake that has a guava base and it didn't disappoint. A friend in our group of 6 got a sandwich other than the Cuban (a busted based sandwich) and said that even though his was great, the Cuban was the clear winner. Stop here first, and then walk your way down Calle Ocho to check out some other spots like Old's Havana for some yummy mojitos.",
      "I've been here a number of times and although the wait time for my food has varied based on time of day or day of the week-- the taste and quality of the food has remained solid. You can order and take to go or grab a seat at an open table inside or outside. Space is limited. My favorite sandwich is the pan con lechón, it is crispy, full of flavorful pork, a special sauce and onions. So much flavor! Ive also tried their Cuban and steak sandwich and was very impressed!Come here-- and you will be counting down the days until your back.",
      "I may not have had every Cubano let alone every sandwich in Miami, but I would not doubt that Sanguich is indeed serving up one of the best there is.The strip mall this place is located is a far reach from what you actually see and received even from the front door and take-out window, something truly unique and ingenious for a small space like this. The inside has the classic yet retro look, personally reminding me very much of Petit Trois here in LA. It's snug but vibrant and lively. Service was fantastic from the moment we walked in to the moment we left. I did not get her name but the girl taking orders with the \"AMOR\" tattoo (Mi Amor?) was a sweetheart. We ordered a Cubano, Pan con Lechon, and Mamey shake. Let me start off by saying the absolutely single negative thing about this meal was the bread on the Cubano because it sadly seems they toasted it a bit too long so it was more dry than \"toasty\". The bread on the Lechon was still soft and light and held together well with each bite.Now as for the rest of the Cubano, this thing is LOADED with everything - ham, pork, (ham and ham? pork and pork?), the ham being so light and slightly sweet while the shredded pork is savory, fatty, and soft. The sharp pickles are absolutely amazing, the spicy mustard adds a kick to balance the fats, and the melty cheese is the icing on the sandwich.Surprisingly yet not surprisingly, the Pan con Lechon was 100x better than the Cubano. This sandwich is INSANE. The bread so toasty and fluffy on the inside soaking up that outstanding marinade of garlic and lemon and orange. The juice of the marinade combining with the fat of the pork soaked up in the bread while the soft meat is bringing it in with each bite, this sandwich was ridiculously tasty. Even my mother who rarely ever eats meat fell in love with this sandwich.Even better? The mamey was the best one I've ever had in Miami.My only regret here is that we didn't have time to come back to try more of their foods from what is already a simple and tight knit menu.But Lord knows, Sanguich will be at the top of my list on every visit to Miami.",
      "Came here and waited outside their door until they opened which landed us the first place in line. We sat at the bar and watched them work their magic preparing our food. We ordered the croquettes, cubanos, and the Miami sandwich. My husband also ordered the cafe con leche. We loved all of our food and the upbeat atmosphere of the restaurant. This restaurant is a must when in Miami, especially Little Havana!!!",
      "After my latest visit, Sanguich de Miami has officially become a must whenever I come down to the 305. Hands down, the best Cuban sandwich I've ever had, plus an amazing take on pan con bistec! Everything is fresh and so flavorful, and the proportion of toppings is perfect. Not to mention, the soft-yet-crispy toasted pan Cubano. Their croquetas are also delicious! Good size to them, freshly-fried.Because the venue is smaller and the seating very limited, we haven't gotten a chance to dine in, but ordering for takeout is simple and efficient, and you better believe we ate it right away both times.",
      "Best Cuban sandwich in Miami? YES! Even my husband who is from Miami concurs.Today we tried not only the classic Cuban but also the Pan con Bistec - buenísimo! Also had some croquetas with that delectable mojo sauce.Small establishment, so definitely suggest ordering pickup. Food was ready when I came to pickup today, no delays. This is a nice new Miami staple for all who venture for a good Cuban sandwich!"

      "Such a hidden gem in Miami Springs. Love the laid back atmosphere of this place. It's like being key west without the long drive. We've eaten the pork chop, chicken fried chicken, fried bread pudding is insane!! Whether it's lunch, brunch or dinner... you can't go wrong.",
      "The food and service was equally horrible. I had the shrimp n grits, my daughter ordered the Captn Crunch French toast with a side of cheese grits and bacon. The cheese grits never arrived and what made it to the table was cold. I believe the staff is trained to not make eye contact so you won't ask for anything so when I finally got someone's attention and reminded them of the cheese grits, he walked off and NEVER CAME BACK. At this point i simply asked for my bill so I can cut my losses and go someplace else. In closing, establishments with outdoor seating should always have propane in their tanks. Perhaps they didn't give a dame because the food comes out cold anyway. What a way to end my 7 days in Miami",
      "This used to be one of my favorite spots. I drive from Kendall to get to crackers. I grew up with southern cooking and this was my go to for southern food. We weren't greeted when we came in like before, which I thought was odd to begin with. We waited a long time for our food once seated. I knew as soon as the food was delivered to the table that something wasn't right. I asked the waiter what has changed and he said the owners. This made sense, I could see that crackers has lost its homey feel that it used to have with the other owners. The fried biscuits were burnt and they taste and look like pillsbury can biscuits. The chicken was caked in a thick coating that tasted awful. Not southern fried chicken at all. The chicken was so tough you couldn't cut through it and it had a freezer burn taste. The pancakes didn't taste good either.Syrup was off tasting too. All in all the food was cheap and it showed. Nothing tasted homemade like it used to be. Fried green tomatoes were the only thing that came out good. I won't be returning again. I believe tourists will be the only people that actually feel this is good southern cooking.",
      "Came here on. Friday afternoon to get a quick bite after my flight from NJ. It was pretty close to the air port and I love soul food. Parking was plenty and the place was clean an nice. We sat outside and there was a nice breeze. They have animals roaming around as well. I order a dr pepper with the chicken an waffles. I originally wanted the half chicken, but they told me their menu was outdated and they didnt have it available. My sister had the green tomato sandwich without bacon a d a side of mac and cheese. My drink tasted sooo flat, it was horrible. The food cane out quick but was underwhelming. The presentation was great, but the chicken I had was FLAVORLESS! It needed salt soooooo bad. Not even honey mustard salvaged it. Chicken has to be seasoned inside and out, but this missed the mark BAD! I couldnt even finish the chicken. But the waffles were great. My sisters sandwich was flavorless as well. She stated \"if I ate this with my eyes closed, i wouldn't be able to tell what I was eating\". The mac and cheese was TRAGIC as well.All in all, the atmosphere and services was nice, but the food lacked flavor and seasoning.",
      "A friend and I met here for a New Year's Day breakfast. It was a great ambiance. The service was good and the food was delicious. They suggested we try the fry biscuits. We asked what they were and the waitress said, \"a ball of sin\".  INDEED!! Oh em gee where has that been all my life. They simply fry a biscuit......who would've thought? Throw on the hunny butter and sin is an understatement! I had the captain crunch French toast, and WOW!  No syrup needed. It is perfect as is, with whipped cream and fruit. (My photo was long after we finished eating - it definitely looked better with fresh whipped cream) My only complaint is they were quite skimpy with the fruit, and they almost diced the strawberry. Other than that, everything was perfect. I can see this being a great date night spot. Give it a try!!!",
      "Our first brunch in Miami and it was super satisfying! I was so full, it kept me satisfied for the rest of the day pretty much. Pretty large portions so you'll definitely have leftovers or can split things with friends. The service was really great. Our server was hilarious and very charismatic and friendly. We went on a Friday morning so there weren't many people at the restaurant at the time so our food was out pretty quickly. Outdoor and indoor seating, but we sat outdoor for the warm weather.",
      "After hearing such great reviews about this place. I finally got to try some of the delicious food available in this Miami Springs Gem We started out with the Fish Dip which was fresh and tasty. And loved the chips and toasted bread that compliments the dip . I then ordered the Breakfast Burger with Cheese Grits and some load FrenchFries !! Once it arrived i knew i was in for a treat because it looked so delicious  And it was ... the bread , the burger  and the Grits were Fantastic !!Go check them out  !!",
      "This is our favorite go-to brunch/lunch spot. Just great vibe, friendly staff, and the garden makes for such a relaxing time. They are animal lovers, and welcome dogs. I know this restaurant was purchased a while back, but the quality has not been affected, and they will honor some of the items that are no longer on the menu. For appetizer, the fried green tomatoes with aioli are fantastic. My husband is a fan of the biscuits with the sweet butter as well. As a main plate, the chicken fried chicken an eggs is one of the most popular items, and rightfully so - veeery good. Honestly, anything you order will make your tummy happy. OH, and they make a mean Arnold Palmer.",
      "One of the worst experiences. I'll start by saying that the waiter was a nice guy. However, from the description on the menu the actual food did not match what was served. The hash had some kind of special BBQ sauce which killed the whole breakfast. The presentation looked like it was thrown on the plate, and it was full of grease. Honestly dog food looked better. Everything else was just cold... eggs pancakes etc. The butter was straight out of the freezer, not spreadable and the syrup was cold. The place from the outside looked run down and we weren't sure it was even open. The inside was just as unkept. We decided to leave and pay for what we had consumed, but the waiter saw we hadn't eaten much so he apologized and took care of our bill. Hopefully they will do better as this place has potential.",
      "Southern cooking in Miami Springs ! Yep that's right, crackers teleports to another place through the flavors and the food of southern United States. One of my favorite things to order here is the chicken fried chicken ! It's perfectly breaded and crunchy with a delicious sausage gravy on top ! I love coming to crackers for a nice casual southern meal!"

      "This place was great! From the moment we came I service, tuna ceviche, tacos, tostadas, and churros were all on point! I'd happily visit this place every time I'm in Miami.",
      "I had been recommended this place by many people, but hadn't had the chance to stop in yet. I was told i had to try the Volcan but only if we were eating in, which we were not. So we opted to try some other stuff instead. I ordered through DoorDash, which was easy and quick and had no fees for pick up. I ordered esquites, asada steak tacos, asere que bolá tacos, and grilled shrimp tacos. Everything was ready on time when i came in and pickup was easy. I got back to the house and everything was just as i ordered and so fresh and delicious. The asere Que bola tacos were so unique with the Maduro in them it was tasty and juicy but my favorite were the shrimp tacos. The perfect seasoning and not over or undercooked. The food was yummy and the prices are average, I'll definitely be back. Thank you!",
      "I am very picky when it comes to Mexican food. I've tried several places, and so far, this is my favorite. The tacos al pastor, chicken quesadilla, and carne asada burrito were delicious, especially the tacos al pastor!! In many places, the tacos are drenched in sauce or don't have pineapple chunks in them, but at this place, you won't regret getting a taco al pastor. The quesadilla had a good amount of cheese, the burrito was a little dry, but it was made up for with their red pepper sauce. They both had good chicken and beef. Portions are small, but enough for a good meal.We ordered to go, but the person on the phone was very pleasant to talk to. He was very attentive, and took the order without rushing.The place looked very clean when we went to pick up our order, and again, the man at the counter was very nice.This is definitely a place to visit again, you won't regret ordering and not being happy with your meal. This place deserves a 5 start rating!!",
      "La Diosa has some of the best flavorful tacos in Miami, they use quality meats and the tortillas are hand made fresh. They cook everything from scratch with raw ingredients. I've eaten in many Mexican restaurants in South Florida and the food is usually generic tasting. The service was perfect and the ambiance was phenomenal, Karaoke night is a blast. The adult beverage selection is also fire!They even have a Cuban taco for those who are too scared to venture off the norm.  I recommend the braised beef tacos with broth! Melts in your mouth, and the appetizers are yummy! Parking can be tough so maybe carpool over.  LBGTQ friendly",
      "I was in Miami quite a lot in the last few months and found myself coming back here again and again. Great atmosphere, amazing service and incredible food. You can get in any time and have delicious tacos. I love the chips with four different sauces to try for free and the environment is just so fun. The birria tacos are excellent, the nachos are more than enough to split amongst a big group and you can get service until late in the night if you are craving a fourth meal. This is definitely one of my go to spots when in Miami!",
      "Decor and ambiance is great and very clean ! The spot is very spacious even if it gets crowded you won't feel cramped. The service was on point and the busier who brings the water and chips for the table is always on spot with timing ! The food was very tasty and the bar service was quick and with good drinks ! The tacos were on point !! They're the traditional taco style.You won't regret coming here !!",
      "This hole in the wall place is perfect for date night or drinks with friends. Coming in, I was not expecting the restaurant to be as popping as it was but getting a table was quick and easy.We started off with a delicious drink. Anything jalapeno i'm sold! It was refreshing with a small kick after. Although we went on Taco Tuesday and the tacos were $4 each, we opted for a birria quesadilla and the birria burrito. I've tried many birria but this has made it to my top 5 list. The burrito was a great size to share. Very flavorful and although I never get rice on my burritos, I did not even notice nor mind the rice on this one.The service was amazing, everyone was nice and the vibes were great. Good music but not loud enough were you can't hear yourself talk. The place is dim and intimate great for date night.",
      "I'm New to this area and was recently recommended this place. Having a Mexican husband I am no stranger to good authentic Mexican food and La Diosa serves up the best homemade tortillas and tacos PERIOD ! Forget any other high profile place in Miami. Little Havana takes the win with this one for BEST MEXICAN food in town. My recommendation: queso fundido with chorizo, elotes, birria tacos, baja tacos, and campechano tacos. Honestly I'm sure everything else we didn't get to try was just as delicious. Will definitely have to be back for the rest. Stop by, try it, and tell me if I'm Wrong. ;) I'mNever wrong when it comes to food !",
      "Good food. Great service. And nice ambiance. The tacos are phenomenal. Definitely coming back.",

      "I loved this spot so much, it's located in the heart of wynwood, there is street parking available. I would recommend for you to make a reservation but they do take walk ins. The ambiance here is great, the DJ spins really good music, they offer hookah, the place is upbeat and definitely a good party vibe.They also offer really good cocktails and appetizers. The service was on point, drinks came out fast and the server was always around.The SNEAKER SHOTS were so cool and you get to keep the sneaker as a souvenir!!!! The CHEESEBURGER DUMPLINGS were so good, the sauce on top was mouth watering, and they give you a good amount for an appetizer. If you're in wynwood and want to have some drinks and grab a few bites with a nice vibe definitely check grails out!",
      "This place is a hidden gem in the Wynwood area.  It has a nice indoor bar and restaurant but the real spot is hanging out in the outside area.  The vibe is crazy with music, sports on TV and the staff running around taking care of guests.We enjoyed a few drinks, our stuff is pretty straightforward some bourbons and vodkas.  They were presented quickly and followed up on with the right timing.  We also had some Poke Nachos that were amazing.  So in my thoughts:Food - CheckDrinks - CheckStaff - another checkSo check this place out if you haven't already.",
      "Came here for some finger food with my hubby. And yes yes and yes. Their wings were HOT and amazing. Their Cesar salad was so good. Had just enough dressing. I couldn't resist not adding shrimp to the salad. Best decision to make. I will definitely be returning for their wings and shrimp Cesar salad. So good! Staff was also amazing and sweet. Thank you Happy New Year",
      "I had a good time here. The space is large and visually appealing, especially if your a sneaker head.   I went with a large group of ladies about 10/12of us.  This place can accommodate and it was still comfortable. Because our large group we basically ate family style.  The portions are a good size and the food was delicious. They had a large space enough to shake a tail feather.Overall a good experience and definitely get a sneaker shot they are so cute",
      "Grails is the perfect happy hour spot with a dope theme.  They have a DJ but the environment is still very chill.  The Guacamole was amazing and the ribs fell off the bone but were also flavorful.   The 88 old fashion is a great drink.  The bar tender/server made it perfectly.  If you're not trying to go to Strip club for happy hour then grails is definitely the best choice.  Thank me later",
      "Came to watch the World Cup, we had breakfast and drinks. Parking is street parking. They have indoor and outdoor seating, lots of screens to watch the game from. I had the chicken and waffles that were pretty good. Fun part they have drinks or shots in a céramique Jordan sneaker you can keep. I of course had to do one! I'll definitely be going back to watch more \"football\".",
      "The appetizer that we ordered were really tasty. But I don't think that for the amount of food you get it's worth the price. It's a bit steep but I get it since their location is trendy and so is the place.  The drinks are actually pretty good and for the price they charge I do think they put a fair amount of liquor. Miriel our server was very attentive and helpful.  Also the Brian the one that brought our food was excellent and kept checking on us and taking our empty dishes away.  The atmosphere and the murals and sneaker theme is dope.  I definitely bought a drink with the Jordan 3 shoe.  You get to take it home. The yuca was a bit hard and burnt. It came with pernil and queso. Tasty but they need to perfect the  yucca and make it crispy. The cheeseburger dumplings were tasty but very small and a few. I don't know if I would come here when it's a full house.",
      "Loved the cool decor, the vibes were nice but the food fell short for me. I was hype to try the cheeseburger sliders but there was nothing special about it. I would've ordered loaded yuca fries or wings but I believed everyone else's hype around it. The Caribbean fufu sliders were good but no wow factor.",
      "Fun and lively environment, we've been here several times. Our most recent outing we were here during Art Basel week for paint/decorate your own shoe event. After the event we caught the Argentina World Cup game, it was a very fun vibe. Good cocktails  and fun music, you'll enjoy your time here."

      "Solid India food and  knowledgeable staff...  definitely worth a visit. The food scene on 79th street from Collins to Biscayne Blvd is really coming alive... worth a trip for casual Foodies.",
      "I previously gave four stars and compliments to this restaurant. However it was many months before we could make it back here, and I am afraid the entire experience has changed, making me wonder if ownership or management is new... the samosas were half the size, the Tikka Masala was a deep red color and tasted EXACTLY like Chef Boyardee Spaghettios from a can (obviously, they just spooned some tomato paste in to make more sauce and didn't even let it cook down to remove the bitterness). And worst of all, the Tandoori Chicken my friends ordered was covered in a thick grainy baste that contained a high level of something tasting like bleach.I am not one for insulting a restaurant for having a bad night, especially after I had such a great experience a few months previous. But the 100% change in food quality across the board was too alarming to let it slide this time. Obviously, nail in the coffin on this place for us. :(Go to Bombay Darbar instead. It's worth the drive to the Grove.",
      "Very sweet owners working and cooking here. Tender, super flavorful tandoori chicken! Delicious mimosas and chutney. Everything was great. This is a reliably good local spot.",
      "Had the chicken Saag which is a cream spinach based masterpiece. I normally do not go for spinach but this is not your regular plate. Varun was my waiter and he said it was the house special, so I took his suggestion and won big time.",
      "Great quality and amount per serving .  Fantastic flavors but ...It is soooooooooo spicy.  Even if you ask for the Mildest. Their \" mild\"  is too hot for the average person . After glasses and glasses of water couldnt finish it . Went home hungry. It's a shame b/c otherwise the food would be excellent. I do not know why do this,  you can always make it hotter for whomever requests it. Instead of loosing 90 % of patrons. That is where Zayka and Darbar get it right, and are always full. Indian food has so many wonderful spices why drown everything with heat instead of making it optional for you to add as much heat as you want.",
      "So Taste Buds of India is under new management and is now Indian Spice. Slightly high prices and small portions because Indian is treated like a delicacy in Miami. The food was delicious though. Service is very good. Interior is bright and clean. They also have a few tables outside in the Normandy Fountain square. They have lunch specials. I'll be back again soon.",
      "Amazing food! Friendly ambiance with a staff that makes you feel at home! Highly recommended!",
      "Super authentic and excellent service. Our server explained us the menu well and was very kind. Will come again soon.",
      "The food was alright but I really enjoyed the atmosphere. I feel like the food could have come a little quicker.",
      "Taste Buds of India..you were my all time favorite restaurant for my Indian food cravings but lately, I don't know what's going on with your food!!!I used to always get the Lamb vindaloo (Extra spicy) and kashmiri naan! Everything about them used to be perfect! The level of spice, the sweetness of the Kashmiri naan, just YUM! However, the last time I ordered from you guys, the lamb vindaloo was mainly just oil and the kashmiri naan was just alright..was a little lighter in the filling but still ok. We sometimes have a bad night so I decided to give you another chance!This time though definitely made me realize this will be the last time I ever order again from here unfortunately! I ordered a lamb tikka masala to change it up and my usual Kashmiri naan. The lamb tikka masala was a tiny portion and tasted like tomato sauce and cream mixed with little bits of meat. I have had better frozen Indian food than that! There were NO vegetables in it at all either. And the Kashmiri naan tasted like a regular naan! There was pretty much NO filling and was super unsatisfactory. So disappointing and what a waste of money :( Hope you guys can get back to the amazing quality you used to serve. But this is my goodbye",
      "Worst $50 delivery I've ever had. \"No onions\" salad loaded with onions. Lamb curry \"mild\" so spicy you could barely taste the meat. It looked like a bowl of spicy red sauce with the small pieces of meat swimming in it. Couldn't tell if it was lamb, dog, goat, with the amount of spicy sauce covering it. Definitely not much of it for the price. No other ingredients in it. Naan bread was unremarkable. On a positive note - jasmine rice was good and delivery took less than 30 min. I think it's because they just microwaved some of the leftovers from the day before, lol. Next time I'll just get a can of Dinty Moore stew from the gas station. Much cheaper and same amount of enjoyment."

      "Hands down my favorite restaurant in Miami. Ambiance is upbeat and intimate. Food is AMAZING does not miss in the year I've been going consistently. Service is outstanding .",
      "Amazing steakhouse Our favorite was the the Australian Wagyu which I can only say was perfection. their sides were so perfectly complimentary. Truffle Mac and cheese, the Brussels sprouts, spinach, broccolini and cauliflower were excellent. Beef lettuce wraps were decent, beet salad was good, kids meals were devoured. ALSO if you're here for breakfast their buffet is great",
      "WOW - To say I was completely blown away by my first time dining here would be an understatement. Whether you're celebrating a special occasion or just craving a delectable meal that will leave you speechless, this is the spot that will be sure to leave a lasting impression. From the lavish and trendy decor, the out of this world dishes, beautiful presentations and impeccable service, every detail was taken well into consideration and perfected.I can say with certainty that this is one of the most gorgeous spaces I've ever eaten a meal in. The sultry vibe, elegantly designed interior, endless display of wine bottles scattered throughout the restaurant and the stunning bar will have you feeling like you're in the midst of dining amongst celebrities. There didn't seem to be a bad table to dine at in sight, but my parents and I were lucky enough to snag one of the beautiful half-moon booths toward the center of the room. When is the last time you've been to a restaurant that brings complimentary French fries to the table? And not just any regular ole' French fries, but a delicious trio of French fries each complimented by their own unique dipping sauce? Bet it's probably never happened before, unless you've eaten here. I thought this was such a neat but simple touch that really set them apart from other high-end restaurants. They also bring yummy rolls topped with sea salt to the table (between the fries & the bread, you might end up in a food coma before you even order if you're not careful). I ordered the tuna tartar for an appetizer and I was in heaven every time I took a bite. Not only does it melt in your mouth, but the presentation alone is enough reason to order this (the way they mix it for you makes for a fun video opportunity if you have your phone ready to record). My parents shared a shrimp cocktail that they both enjoyed - The shrimp were massive! Following the appetizers, I munched on a cesar salad which was perfectly dressed. Now... the STEAK. Holy moly, one of the best filet mignons I have had yet. It was ridiculously flavorful, tender & juicy. Melted in your mouth and bursted with flavor. If you're a steak lover, it would be a crime to come here and not order it. The mashed potatoes that accompanied it were also flavorful, but I thought they were a little too runny (my only complaint of the whole meal). If you're a fan of grilled onions, do yourself a favor and order a side of these to top your steak with and thank me later. The \"Smoked Chocolate S'mores\" dessert was ridiculously decadent and was the perfect finish to an impeccable meal. Yes, it's insanely pricy and yes, it's totally worth it. My experience here was one of the best dining experiences I've ever had in Miami - And that says a lot given the fact that Miami is one of the hottest spots in the country for foodies. This restaurant hit it out the park for me and I'm already searching for an excuse to go back to South Florida and to savor new dishes on their menu.",
      "The restaurant is spacious and nice. Bar is nice as well.Staff was friendly and attentive.For appetizers the tuna tartare was fresh and seasoned well.They also bring you French fries 3 different ways with 3 different sauces. I had the certified Angus rib cap cooked medium rare and It was good and flavorful. The side of Mac and Cheese was good as well.",
      "Our favorite was the the Australian Wagyu which I can only say was perfection.",
      "Ambiance was awesome. The dishes, coctails and the dessert were so delicious. All the employees were so polite and friendly. They celebrated our honeymoon with a cute card, it was so nice.They made our special day unforgettable.",
      "Wonderful experience! Fabulous service. Timing, everything was a 10.  Our server really made our night fabulous, she was awesome. Great steak, Mac and cheese with truffle was really nice. Molten cake was super good as well. I must say everything was impeccable.",
      "Phenomenal cuisine. Never have a enjoyed such a succulent and flavourful sea bass - it is one of their renowned specials. But the lack of bones in the fish was made up for by the pained bones in my rear.The decor was beautiful but very far from comfortable. The low chairs were too uncomfortable for eating. The benches; built for slaves.The overall experience was truly hampered by a god awful designer deserving of life in prison for her domestic terror on comfort. 4/5 not bad",
      "This plus is amazing! We had a private room & our server was Erin. Erin was very pleasant, patient, informative & very professional. She suggested several appetizers & dinner. It was our first time visiting this restaurant & it definitely won't be our last.",
      "Food was incredible. I love that when you get to the table instead of getting some bread you get french fries. Service was also impeccable and ambiance is very family friendly in my opinion"

      "What an amazing spot, we absolutely LOVED it. It's fairly young and trendy, so I would not take my baby boomer parents here (or a baby in general)- but for a younger, fun, lively crowd, this is perfect. The inside is really cool - lots of artwork, somewhat hidden restaurant, similar to a speakeasy. The drinks were unique and incredible and the food was OUTSTANDING! Very gastronomic - if you're into that sort of thing (my parents wouldn't get it). We basically ordered the entire menu, until we nearly exploded. Here were a few memorable plates (as in, those I can remember after imbibing for a few hours)...Spanglish milk bread - the black salt on top. WOW. They say, once you go black (salt), you never go back right? Exactly. The guava butter was unlike any butter I have ever had. It's very tropical, and fruity! Wagyu beef ravioli - that blue cheese sauce was to die for - take some of that milk bread and drunk your bread in this sauce to your heart's desire (and worry about the consequences later, because bread and cheese, whew!) Nitro Watermelon Tataki - the only remotely healthy thing that entered our mouths at dinner. It's such a cool fish - watermelon, pomegranate seeds, toasted pumpkin seeds, olive oil and a total flavor overload. Not to mention the fact that the fish came out looking like sashimi grade tuna. So cool. Arroz Mamposteado - this was a cool fish. It was rice and beans, but mixed with avocado creme and and pork belly and chips. Incredible. I'm not much of a dessert but holy smokes did we devour the suspiro. I'm quite positive I licked the jar towards the end of the evening - don't judge me. I wish I could remember what cocktail I had, but the choices are all so unique and fun, I should have tried them all. Eh, gives me a reason to go back, right?!",
      "Thank you so much for the kind words and the detailed review of all of our dishes, Shannon.  It was a pleasure hosting you, and we look forward to your next visit!",
      "Obsessed is an understatement.Found this place on Yelp (I love you Yelp!) and with the rating and images I knew I was SOLD. The show stopping, craft cocktails is what I came for and I wasn't sure what to expect once we came. Was it a hype? Would I be disappointed? Who cares! You're in Miami and going to a Spanglish cocktail bar. We didn't make reservations but we did read it wasn't too hard to get in. And it was exactly just that. Came here at around 9:30 pm on a Saturday night and we were seated to the side entrance table with couches right away. It wasn't a good option for dining but we literally only came here for the cocktails so it was perfect!The vibe check in this place was everything. There was a live dj tucked in to the side making sure the music was on point. And it was!On to the craft cocktails:I ordered the Pornstar Mejican@ and it was delicious wish the mezcal was more of the star of the show and to be honest, given that everyone else's cocktails were truthfully visually so pleasing wish the presentation for this one was as well but that's totally ok!!! I still loved my experience. My hubby ordered the Cafetera Old Fashioned and WOW. What a presentation and fun way to serve it with an actual cafetera. It was definitely a show stopper. The Caipirinha Frizá was delicious and very unique as well and the Paparazzi came served in a photo lens so that was pretty cool!We loved Spanglish, would be back in a heart beat. Overall great vibes for cocktails and pretty cool presentation that really makes this place stand out. Excited to try their food next time!",
      "This place gives my New York Vibes OD! It's definitely giving New York Speakeasy Vibes. You'll probably miss it if your not paying attention because the sign outside is only a neon bottle sign. Inside is intimate with the cutest decor, low key, playing all the classic jams. I love a place that sets a vibe with an good playlist! Okayyy! We came for drinks after dinner, so we didn't order food but they did have a menu. All the drinks we ordered were sooo freakin good, and were in creative instagram worthy cups. This is definitely going to be my new hideaway spot. Service was amazing! Will be coming back!",
      "Okay, here's the thing with this place, it's so freaking loud that you can barely hear the person next to you, it's impossible to have any sort of conversation with a large group of people. The food was okay and drinks were pretty good on the other hand, so I think this is a good place for dates, just not a large gathering.",
      "Hi Anton, thank you so much for taking the time to share your experience at Spanglish.  We apologize for the music being too loud, and this is something we’re going to adjust.  Although, we’re happy to hear you enjoyed the drinks!We hope to see you again soon!",
      "What an awesome chic place.  Amazing craft cocktail & gastro pub style tapas.

      "The entrance to Spanglish is so subtle that it's easy to miss! Once you enter, the ambiance is cozy, intimate, and welcoming. We came because of the happy hour -- their cocktails were $9 and some small dishes were marked down! We ordered a round of the caipirinhas first and sadly were a bit disappointed, it was way more tart than expected and just tasted like lemon juice. The Chilcano tasted similar with the overpowering citrus. The Spanglish mule was way better! For small plates, we ordered the octopus croquettes, Caribbean dumplings, and a side of yuca. The octopus croquettes were my favorite of the items we ordered -- crispy, served hot, and the octopus inside was tender. The Caribbean dumplings were a little mushy, and the yuca was a bit tough and the sauce it was served with tasted like Big Mac sauce which I am not a fan of. Everything came out pretty fast, though!",
      "Finally got to visit Spanglish and let's just say I fell in love! I came here for happy hour with a friend and honestly we were blown away by how delicious everything was. We ordered the Spanish Milk Bread, Timba Frita, Queso E' Craba , and Tuna Tostadas. My favorite dish we tried was the Timbra Frita. It was the perfect bite full of flavor. We also ordered cocktails. We both ordered the Paparazzi which honestly tasted amazing but the presentation was killer. It comes served in a camera lens. Overall this place is a vibe. The music was lit. They were playing bad bunny. The artwork is awesome. I definitely see myself coming back here.",
      "Location a bit hidden in plain sight, so be sure to stop and read signs. Small  and intimate setting with a great ambiance for drinks and light bites with friends. The food was ok nothing over the top or extraordinary. I did like my margarita with the seafood bites. Drinks here before a walk around in Wynwood is never a bad idea.",
      "This place has no sign in front. We drive up and down and finally found it. Outside looks like it was closed. Nothing indicating it was opened except for a sign out front that shows menu of the day. We walked it and surprisingly was like wow. This is a cute small cozy restaurant.  The booth I say were pretty close to one another.  The bar area has 6 stools. The food was excellent! Extremely flavorful and so good. The octopus appetizer was amazing. We ordered one of their popular dish and weren't disappointed.  I forgot to photo that dish because I was so hungry.  Everything we had was great including the drinks. We love craft drinks and for sure it was super crafty. The paparazzi drink was so cute. It came in a camera cup and tasted great.I would be definitely coming back here again soon and recommend everyone to try if you haven't been here.",
      "Came here to try a few drinks on a Friday night and it wasn't as busy as I expected. I was able to sit at the bar and watch the bartender make these really cool looking and tasty drinks! The paparazzi was my favorite. Something about the dill and passion fruit combination was something I didn't know I needed. The vuela paloma was just okay, I'm just not the biggest fan of grapefruit. And the cafetera old fashioned tasted like a REALLY strong Cuban coffee, which I really enjoyed. Although the drinks were great, the vibe was kinda ruined by these drunk idiots sitting next to us at the bar, yelling and screaming. But I would still come here again to enjoy a cool curated cocktail."

      "LOVE LOVE LOVE this place.  They have an amazing craft cocktail menu... and let me tell you the bartenders put a lot of love and effort into crafting your drink.  Fresh ingredients.  Unique flavors.  All the things.  They have a good happy hour menu, if you happen to be there during that time.  Food-wise - we weren't able to eat here.  BUT, everything we saw come out looked fantastic.  If we had more time, I would 100000% come back here to eat.  We heard the brunch is quite tasty as well.Atmosphere.  LOVE THE VIBE.  Dark.  Moody.  Coppery.  Industrial.  And they have a great outdoor seated area.  This is also located in the trendy, hipster Wynwood neighborhood.HIGHLY recommend.",
      "Le Chick has the swanky ambiance you're looking for for dinner / happy hour. Dark lit with beautiful art pieces. By far were the appetizers the highlight of our meal and we'd probably only return for that. The Brussels sprouts were deliciously crisp, caramelized with a slight touch of lemon in random bites. It was huge for 3 people and we had leftovers. The octopus ceviche was also delicious but the presentation was in a cocktail glass which made it weird to share. Lots of flavor and we enjoyed. To drink I had the CIELO MORADO which had a foamy top and slightly sweet. Interesting to sip on. Onto the disappointing entrees:My friend said her ribs were dry and she added bbq sauce - nothing to brag about. Crispy chicken sandwich was solid but by no means reinventing the wheel. My lamb chops were pretty skimp for $40. There was quite the drama on adding truffle mashed potatoes as a side and once they finally honored it I was so disappointed. The potatoes were dry and the truffle was a dollop of idek what that was loaded with salt. Couldn't finish it.",
      "Came here for a business lunch since our temporary co working space is around the block. Some of myCo workers were skeptical but they went with my suggestion and now they all love and trust my dining opinions! Le Chick was an awesome experience! The wagyu burgers were phenomenal and cooked perfectly medium to the point were one barely had to chew the burger. My boss went with the fried chicken appetizer and that too was incredible. Perfectly season and fried with a spicy maple sauce. A great meal was had by all and we'll be coming back here sometime soon and you should too!",
      "So delicious! Service was fast and very friendly (Josh I believe was our server). The drinks were refreshing and well balanced. The fried chicken is a must- so crunchy and juicy at the same time. Comes with honey and a homemade ranch that is delicious.I would definitely recommend stopping by for happy hour. Great little vibe on the patio in this beautiful Florida winter weather, and great prices.",

      "My husband and I were hanging out in Wynwood looking at all of the murals and found Le Chick! This is a reservation type of place so we did have to wait around 30-45 minutes for a table. While you wait, you can order drinks at the bar and hangout. I got the Pina Colada which was very yummy. Once a table was ready, we were seat promptly and our waiter was fantastic! Answered all of our questions and was attentive. I ordered the rotisserie chicken and my husband ordered the BBQ pork ribs - both were the best chicken and ribs we've ever had. The meat was falling off the bone and beautifully seasoned. We also ordered the chocolate goodie jar as it was my birthday when we stopped by. Also very good! Would highly recommend! The vibe is very intimate but also very cozy and high-class. We loved our experience and would absolutely recommend for anyone stopping by the Wynwood area.",

      "Le Chick has to be one of my favorite spots in Miami, and make it a point to come here each time I visit! This time around, we were able to come for happy hour, which has some great deals. We first started off with the Sangria and an IPA, and sipped those while enjoying the nice breeze outside. I'm not an IPA fan, though my partner seemed to enjoy it, but I did like the sangria.Once we were done with our first round, we ordered a second round - frose for me and my partner chose an old fashioned. I really enjoyed the frose, because it had a nice level of sweetness to it!The main star of the show though is the chicken sandwich, only $12 during happy hour! Very generous portion of good quality chicken with pickles and cheese - we got ranch on the side and are typically not big fans of ranch but did enjoy the housemade ranch here. We also opted for an order of the $3 fries which was also a very generous portion.All in all, highly recommend coming here for happy hour. Every menu item we saw brought out looked and smelled delicious, and the fried chicken sandwich certainly fell in that category!",

      "My friend and I stumbled upon this place wandering around for Basel. We were not that hungry so decided to split an entrée. Their \"Get in my Belly\" sandwich was SO yummy! The truffle aioli, arugula and brisket was a match made in epicurean heaven. Their frosé's were flavorful, refreshing and a welcome cool off from tromping around in the sun all morning. Our bartender was very friendly and attentive. It's Miami and Wynwood so prices are a little steep. We each had 2 frosé, split the entree but it was still $56 per person with tip included. Overall it was a good experience so I'll definitely be back!",

      "I love LOVE this place for happy hour, since everything else in the area is pretty expensive. From I believe 3-7pm, you can get reduced priced cocktails and bites, with my favorite cocktail being the Sangria that they offer. I've also tried the pina colada which while strong, just isn't as good as the Sangria. As for the Happy Hour bites, my favorites were the corn and the burger - the fries, fried chicken, and the deviled eggs were just okay so I may not get those items again. There is also a very cute little outdoor section of the restaurant that is lovely during the winter. Overall great place to come for an excellent Happy Hour!",

      "Delicious food and service! You should defnitely get a reservation if you want to eat here. Good options for both meat eaters and vegetarians. Only downside is that it is pricey... but that is expected in the Wynwood area. I suggest going during HH!"

Wow The Malbec julip basil cocktail and Manhattan for happy hour was incredible. One of the best cocktails wow Apps, lamb and beef empanada- yumKids pasta $19- a bit steep but very goodShort rib dinner and Skirt steak- delish!!! Wow fall off the bone delicious short rib over polenta and carrots. Dessert was homemade date pie with ice cream $16- also a bit steepBut since we enjoyed the entire meal it was all well worth itWould def done here again !",
      "Very cute place. They were busy for the World Cup game. Unfortunately they ran out of majority of the menu items. Not sure if this was unique to the situation that day or part of the brunch norm. Overall though, the food was very delicious. I just wish I could've had the Choripán!The service was good considering there was so much people.",
      "This is one of my favorite restaurants in Miami - and it is so great before heading over for a show at the nearby theater. All of their wine cocktails are delicious - plus their wine selection is fantastic. But the food really is to die for here. My husband and I always split everything, because we can't decide what to get. All the empanadas are excellent - but I love the Bunbury one the best!For smaller dishes - I highly recommend the Duck Magret (the butternut squash puree is plate-licking good!) and the Non Provoleta with sausage. So so good!For an entree - the Duck Confit and Ravioles de Calabaza are both excellent. However, the Braised Short Ribs al Malbec are to die for; everything from the perfectly cooked meat to the creamy polenta - it is truly one of the best dishes I've had.",
      "I went last night with a friend and it exceeded all my expectations. First off, the atmosphere is very cozy and inviting. It looks like you're entering an old library. There's a beautiful leather couch and tons of books at the entrance. Now for the really important part - the food. The foood was amazing. I had the Vacio steak and it was divine. I would rank it in the top 5 steaks I've ever eaten in my life. I have been to Buenos Aires and this steak was as good as anything I had there.  I'm still thinking about it a day later. The beef empanadas was great. Terrific flavor and texture. I will confess I was not a fan of the prosciutto and Brie one... let's leave those ingredients for the charcuterie board. :-).  The tiramisu was perfection. Lovely textures, flavors, and presentation. Exactly what one would want from that classic dish. Finally, the prices are very reasonable. High value for your money. I highly recommend checking out this adorable gem! I will most certainly go back.",
      "I was in the area for a short while on Tuesday night night so I stopped by because of the reviews and had a great time. As soon as you walk in it gives the feeing of being inside a speakeasy. The restaurant is decorated with books and a siding door which plenty of seating for groups or small parties.They do take reservations but I wanted to sit at the bar this occasion. I had the Spanish American old fashion which was one of the best old fashioneds I've had. And to try I had the braised lamb empanada. I highly recommend getting this, the meat was so tender, juicy and bursting with flavors!The service by the whole staff was excellent also and the bartender offered a lot of great suggestions on food options and nights to come for different events.They also have live music playing as well.I will definitely be back for a sit down dinner!",
      "The inside was fabulous and roomy. Nice size for large parties. They also offered outdoor seating. The salads were tasty and best burger sliders I have tasted. The burger was cooked perfectly.",
      "I wish I could give Bunbury more than 5 stars, they deserve it. When I walked in I was shocked by how cute everything was! We actually walked through a book/wine shelf doorway to get to our table. I took a date here and let's just say we were both impressed. We ordered a bottle of wine from Patagonia, Argentina (because wine not?!) it was around $54. It was delicious and super easy to drink. We went with a tapas style of ordering since we wanted to try a little bit of everything. What we ordered:Spinach, zucchini and parm empanada - small but probably one of the best empanadas I've ever had. Brie Crocante - delicious! The almond crust around the Brie is super crispy and the cheese oozes out when you cut it. Server with tomatoes and a salad. Tablita Malbec Plate - let's just say I just started eating steak again and this was probably the best steak I've ever had. My date agreed! The perfect balance of crispy and tender. Zucchini Envoltini - this was good but nothing special. I also heard they have a happy hour....  will be back here very soon! (Still thinking about that steak)",
      "Where do I begin with this place. Just in amazing experience overall. Service: they work as a team hereAtmosphere: beautiful outdoor and indoor seatingFood: so so so good!!! Everything was cooked to perfection tasted amazing. The empanadas the steak the sausage it was all wonderful. Their menu is different and delicious. Lots of options to choose from.This is a great place for a date or a group of friends. Highly recommend!",
      "We had a fantastic time! Here's what you need to know before you get to the restaurant:-book a reservation-valet parking is the only parking we could find (you will see the signs for it, it's a very small place outside a parking garage)-staff mostly speaks Spanish-attire was varied but mostly date night casual Excellent service! Waiters were constantly filling up our water, very classy staff. Would go here for a date night because the lighting in the main dining room was lovely and it has a speakeasy/library vibes. A bit loud but it's good music so I didn't mind. There is a bar area with a live DJ if you didn't make a reservation ( we came for dinner on a Saturday night). There are 2 bathroom locations in the building. Food:-Moscow mule was average -the complimentary bread is sweet and doughy and comes with a slightly spicy butter I didn't care for but it's cool they're trying to be different . Regular butter would have complimented the bread better though.-the spinach empanadas were SO GOOD, the Brie empanadas were savory and nice but not as good as the spinach. Lots of stuffing! -burrata salad: ordered this because my stomach needed something light and it was one of the worst burrata salads I've had. Ingredients were fine, but there's not even salt and pepper at the table.Very deconstructed (cut it up yourself), no dressing for $22-steak, grilled vacio:Wow, this is what you need to order it is amazingly fatty (without the grissel) unique flavor, perfectly cooked The experience outweighed the low energy salad  that's why I'm giving it 5 stars. Our bill was like $113",
      "Every time I come here the music is always sooo good. Brunch , dinner , or for a quick bite before the gym, the playlist just has great music. I must visit when they have live music.Anywho since I live in the area I always come here for brunch or a bite before I hit the gym and this place never disappoints.I love the aesthetic it's very vintage like.It's just such a great restaurant to visit. Food and service is amazing! I will continue to be a regular here."

      "We had the best experience at Cafe La Trova. I accidentally made a Sunday reservation instead of a Friday night reservation. The place was absolutely swinging and I was doubtful they would find a spot for us. To my surprise and delight, the manager worked some magic and found a spot for my 4 top. Once seated we ordered cocktails which were all delicious and not stingy on the alcohol. We ordered croquettes, ceviche and empanadas to start. All were perfection. I would definitely order them again.For dinner I got the oxtail pasta which I pretty much licked of my plate. It was cooked and flavored perfectly. The rest of my party were impressed by their food as-well, the portions were generous and very authentic.Lastly, i would be remiss if I didn't mention the phenomenal atmosphere - vibrant, colorful, loud, and witty. I would most certainly recommend this Miami gem to anyone. We will be back!",
      "Best 50 of the World for a reason.Best 50 of the World for a reason!!!We went last night and restaurant was packed, even though the GM Rene, master in hospitality gave us a table right the way! Evelyn took care of us like family members and she was beyond of excellent: very knowledgeable about menu mentioning every single ingredient of plate and recommended Octopus, it was melting in the mouth, Skirt steak ropa vieja, explosion of flavors, bacalao croquettes, wow, Cuban sandwiches empanadas, omg!!!We were impressed behind the bar from Loiver and Yasmani that welcomed us like brother and sister and made amazing Mojito and exquisite Daiquiri following International Cocktails recipe: they are from another planet and made every one happy!Live music bring you directly to Vina and all guest ended up dancing!Very fun night!!! Looking forward for the best culinary experience we ever had!Bravissimi!!!",
      "Thanks so much for sharing the awesome pictures and amazing review, Giuseppe! We love hearing (and seeing) what food and drinks our guests enjoyed :). Your review rocks. Thank you!",
      "Across the board.. EXCELLENT. We had the best date night! It's an experience, and it was everything I could've asked for.Arrived at 9pm, without reservations. [ I was unaware -- if you want to dine here, it's important to make reservations a week prior ]1. The staff is courteous.They informed us, there WAS a line to wait for space at the bar. You can eat + drink at the bar. I didn't mind at all -- so we waited about 20 mins, and found a spot in the bar towards the back. 2. The food/drinks are remarkable!!!I had 4 coffee martini's; all so delicious! You can taste the love it was made with. The bar tenders, worked as a team, and offered above average service.Appetizer: Steak Empanadas Main Dish: Ropa ViejaBoth, still make my mouth water. So delicious. I am a Miami native, of Cuban descent, so my authenticity standards are high... but they really BLEW ME AWAY! Very authentic. 3. The ambiance was so fun.They had a LIVE BAND! They were so good! Great choice of music. Everyone was dancing, and having fun. Such a fun atmosphere!After 12pm, the bar in the back turns into an 80's club! They had an AMAZING DJ, playing the best 80's songs! What a vibe! If you're looking for a good time, Cafe La Trove is it -- eyes closed! A true 5 star!",
      "Aww, you’re making us blush. Thank you so much for the kind words and awesome photos! Your review is the kind of review that makes us love what we do even more :).  We really  look forward to hosting you again soon!",
      "Love the place. Really good food, we had the octopus, queso frito, gambas al ajillo and the chupe de mariscos!! And for dessert we order the banana tres leches and was to die for! And also the live music is great, you can dance in the dinning room, very fun ambiance! I will go back again! Decoration is really cool!",
      "Wow, thank you so much for your kind words, Katia! We love reading about what dishes our guests enjoy the most :). We hope you can join us again soon!",
      "I can only repeat and validate what others have said here. Call ahead for reservations. We snuck in without because of an opening at the bar but it was packed on a random Tuesday night. They do an incredible job of recreating a Cuban environment here. We loved our cocktails and the skirt steak ropa vieja. It somehow came out in minutes but was still super tasty (I don't normally associate speed and quality). We ate up every last rice and bean with the sauce and tender meat.It was fun to watch the bartenders get into it and grab some percussion at times to play along with the music. Their cocktail making shows were also fun to watch. Price wise it's about what I'd expect for Miami and we'll worth it considering the ambiance, music, and food quality. The cliental is a true melting pot.",
      "Thank you so much for your kind words and awesome photos, Andrew! Nothing makes us happier than reading about an experience like yours :). We hope you can join us again soon!",
      "Before going to Cafe La Trova I'd never eaten Cuban food before. We had dinner reservations for 5pm but we were able to sit at the bar and enjoy happy hour. The drinks and appetizers are $7 during happy hour. I ordered the Jamon Croquettes and a glass of Prosecco. My sisters ordered the spinach & feta croquettes and the calamari. No complaints! Once our table was ready, we were sat near a stage where a live band performs every night starting at 7 or 7:30pm. I ordered the Arroz con pollo and it was very flavorful. The rice was a creamy texture and the chicken was nice and tender. I also ordered the sweet corn & chicken empanadas. The empanadas were my favorite part of the meal! They came with a pico sauce and it was so good. My sisters ordered mojitos and mules and we're extremely pleased with the flavor of the drinks they ordered. Cafe La Trova has won multiple worldwide and nationwide awards for bartending. Classy and elegant environment.",
      "Thanks so much for sharing the awesome pictures, Charmayne!  We love hearing (and seeing) what food and drinks our guests enjoyed! Your review rocks. Thank you!",
      "I finally got to experience the world of Cafe La Trova. The enchanting Cuban street atmosphere, the band popping on and off stage to play their wonderful live music, the fast but elevated bites and the precision of the bartenders in creating fresh, original cocktails. What a treat this place is, especially if you can make it in earlier. Their happy hour runs from 4-7 pm daily and features small plates and a selection of standard (but very good) cocktails for $7 each. It was perfect to go in after 6:30 pm and be able to get seats at the bar before the night crowd ushered in and turned the place into a lounge by 9 pm.There is one bar immediately when you walk into the restaurant, and another bar all the way in the back. Both bars and pretty much all of the seating area has a good view of the small stage where a live band plays Cuban music. The back bar has more space since almost all four sides of it are open for counter seating. It has four male bartenders all dressed in floral shirts mixing drinks and ringing up tabs nonstopThe bartender who served us approached and greeted us quickly and served several other people while more came to the bar as the night began. He was always available for any new orders, And the best treat was that we were able to watch him make cocktails. He was very meticulous in his mixing and garnishing methods. Twice I saw him throw out a citrus slice that had meant to be a garnish on the drink he was working on since it had fallen off or was not landing the way he intended it to. He also used small tongs to handle the garnishes. We never saw him directly touch any drink ingredients with his fingers when he was putting them together.On the bartender's recommendation that everyone who comes to La Trova should have a mojito, I ordered one and adored it. The freshness of the mint and lime juice, along with the slight sweetness of the muddled sugar and effervescence of the soda water, brought the rum into a refreshing, comfortable sip after sip. That's on happy hour, by the way!I tried a bit of the Pisco Sour and was mystified. The cocktail had been tremendously shaken, since I was able to watch it being made in front of me, and all the force of the shaking created an incredibly well blended and balanced mixture of the Pisco, egg white, Syrup and line juice. We also ordered the Frozen Negroni because where else can you get one? Typically, Negronis can come off quite smoky, but this one had enough other elements like orange, lime, rum and vermouth to offset and lighten the heft of Campari.Can you believe I haven't even talked about food yet? We had the Calamari and Empanada de Pollo off the happy hour menu and were extremely satisfied. The empanadas are two in one order, Big enough to be a sizable snack for one person each and were generously stuffed with sweet corn and shredded chicken. The spicy pico that came with them was vinegary and addictive. The calamari were large, generously breaded and tender. The aioli with Tajin was a welcome flavor boost for dipping.I can't wait to return and try out more cocktails and food items. Maybe next time I'll have an actual full meal there, or maybe just drinks as I listen to the band. Either way, I know it'll be a great experience. See for yourself!",

      "My cuban love affair starts right here.Having lived in Miami/Miami Beach in the not so distant past, I remember all the places that I went either alone or with a group of friends. Even while I was living the \"miami dream\" so to speak.... no  one ever mentioned cuban food or cuban restaurants or cuban clubs.   How can this be?  Maybe I was running with the wrong crowd or maybe it was a bunch of people who were spending daddy's trust fund money... This night.  The best night of my life happened right here.  Right here at Cafe La Trova.I had already read the press about this place and about the man.  You know, press is hard to believe sometimes, I know Miami, you have to overreach, overstate, overdo...just about everything in order to get people's attention.Knowing very very little if anything about Cubans, the food, or the culture, I decided to venture out to Little Havana.  When I was living in this part of the world... over 10 years ago... Little Havana was not the place to go to... oh no...!  Tourists would come to Little Havana, to buy cigars... during the day.  That's it.  MAYBE, just maybe they would venture out to that famous touristy cuban restaurant of 50 yrs..but honestly, I was never impressed.Decided it was high time that I truly experience the essence and flavor of cuban culture, cuban food and cuban nightlife by venturing out to Calle Ocho.I meandered through the street enjoying the sounds and sights coming at me from many directions, but I always had in the back of my mind that I needed to... no MUST go to La Trova!  It was nagging at me.   How in the world can I travel across the country to be in Miami and not go to La Trova ?!?  It was unthinkable.Having brought a limited wardrobe and not really thinking correctly about the dress code, I arrived at La Trova around 7:28pm.   By the way ladies... people dress up here... fully decked... short little dresses and bejeweled to the max so I wasn't at all prepared. I WAY early... way before a saturday night in Miami gets started. Found the PERFECT spot in the bar area to view the band.  It was a 4 person band by the name of Salsa Song.   All the pieces of my night were quickly falling into place.Started with the Award Winning Cocktail called BuenaVista featuring gin, cucumber, mint, elderflower liquer ,,,  Incredible !  so tasty and so balanced.  I chose a very limited number of items from the menu because I was not hungry at the time since I had already eaten.  That was a big mistake.  I SHOULD have saved my appetite for the delicious cuban cuisine that is served up with love at Cafe La Trova!Honestly,  I came for the live music, the people, the location, the attention, the servers, the bar and the scene.   If truth be known ... I've become kind of bored with the gourmet food scene.  Its sterile.  Its serious.  It has no life giving energy.I walked into Cafe La Trova, tired and confused.  Over the last several years, just like it has been for millions of other people, it has been a fight.  A fight not only to stay alive but to find the joy that is supposed to be in living.In a very short period of time, after a cocktail or two and some excellent live cuban music... I started to be filled with joy again.  There is NO WAY you can listen to music coming from the band Salsa Song and not begin to move in your seat or jump up and start dancing. It is NOT a requirement that you get up and dance.  I know there are a lot of people who would rather enjoy the entertainment rather than BE the entertainment.  No worries.  You will be very comfortable at La Trova.After a short while I decided to walk over to where I saw the owner standing, Julio.  He was speaking with another guest but my enthusiasm with this place got the best of me and I just had to speak to him.  He was very distinguished, calm and had a wonderful smile on his face.   I was really taken aback by how much I had this instant attraction to him.Call it love at first sight, or call it whatever you want... but I can truthfully say, I am in love with Julio.  He will probably read this, think I'm nuts, but that's ok.   Stranger things happen.   Hopefully, when you meet Julio and his entire staff you will also see the dedication that they put forth in making sure the patrons of this restaurant are completely happy and how much passion just flows out towards everybody.   I've never seen bartenders more well trained and more cosmopolitan than the guys that work here as \"mixologists\" and more.  In fact, every now and then, they will get into the music making part of things as well... and chime in with the band.I can see that Julio has put years and years of love into the creation of Cafe La Trova.",
      "Aww, you’re making us blush, Kimberley. Thank you for your kind words and for  taking the time to share this amazing review! Nothing makes us happier than reading about an experience like yours :).  To be honest, I think we're all in love with Julio ;). Please come back soon, we can't wait to see you again!  We look forward to hosting you again soon. Your review is the kind of review that makes us love what we do even more. Thank you for taking the time to share about your experience with us.",
      "Ay café la trova. Until 11 or 12 this place is an ode to Cuba and all things miami. After that time? 80s bar!! A fun twist as the night goes on. I've never been here and not have a great time! Usually I'm just waiting for the club in the back to pop off but even then they have live Cuban music blaring over the people eating, talking, dancing in their chairs, and oh yes you better believe there's a conga line at some point!  The people who work here are always so fun and really amo up the vibe!",
      "Aww, thank you, Ashley! Nothing makes us happier than reading about an experience like yours :). We can’t wait to welcome you back soon!",
      "A friend and I went in for dinner on a Thursday night and had an amazing time! The food was delicious, the drinks were on point, dessert did not disappoint, service was shockingly amazing, and the vibe was so fun and energetic!",

      "A must stop but only if your not shy to eat in public lol cute spot and decent atmosphere",
      "I literally paid 12 dollars for a dry piece of bread with a bit of nutella and nuts on it. This is a tourist trap and people only go to get the photo of the penis.It's not even tasty. Avoid.",
      "Unfortunately not the experience I was hoping for my friend's bachelorette party! The first night, when we walked over around ~10.30pm on a Friday, the store was closed despite official opening hours till midnight. We returned Saturday afternoon to try again, but the first vibes you get from walking in here are that it's a little bit run-down, poorly maintained, kind of grimy, and pretty much good for only the laughs.It also ended up being pretty pricey (online menu wasn't that clear) - with a dip + toppings you'll run ~$12 for what is very much an okay-ish dessert. But we got some good photos out of it at least!",
      "Not what I was expecting. My sister  saw this spot on tik tok and recommended that I check it out while in Miami. I took a Lyft to south beach with the sole purpose of patronizing this business. Upon walking in- I was not met with a hello, a can I help you or anything- besides a blank stare!!  The desserts offered were on display. The staff finally asked  \" which one do you want?\" After picking one, he then said and what dipping ? I opted for white chocolate and then he asked what topping?? I went for the Oreo. The grand total? Nearly $13!!  I honestly was expecting the funny antics and an actual experience from this business. I really hope that the owner is able to train staff on how they should be engaging the customers. I think an experience would justify the high price. Overall I feel like I got a piece of cake on a stick for $12-not worth it!!!!  Additionally, the place was not clean. The floor had a drink spilled and there is no telling how long  it had been sitting there! I would highly encourage the owner of this spot to come back into the picture to ensure this business stays afloat. It's going to be a strong no for me- save your money!",
      "Very fun spot. The guy behind the counter had puns for days and gave us great fast service. I wish the chocolate hardened rather than it being just chocolate sauce but just me being picky",
      "Sexy taiyaki! Went inside on a mutual dare after drinking at the bar next door. I convinced my friend to get a chocolate covered treat and the employee kindly made a fresh batch which was only a few minutes' wait. It felt like the bachelorette party we never had, lol. She said it was tasty, and we had a laugh. Worth the stop!",
      "Honestly, come for the experience but share one because this is VERY filling and overly sweat. I did enjoy it, from getting to pick what I wanted to the taste, it was an awesome experience but I'm glad I shared it with my mom because there was no one I could've had a full one! I couldn't even eat half.",
      "Pros: Delicious dough, a variety of toppings, and they ask for consent before spreading their goodness all over your dessert.Cons: Limited seating, take your dessert on a stroll!",
      "This place is an outstanding comedic experience. You won't experience a place like this anywhere else. We made this out pit stop after dinner for some tasty bachelorette fun for desert. The service is outstanding.... We each ordered the penis and while we got the toppings the commentary as they topped the desert and questions they asked so bluntly but funny were the best. You don't only pay for the food but you pay for the experience and there is no experience out there even close to this. If I make it out to Miami again I'll be bringing my friends here. U won't be disappointed in this one but! Plus it taste good...",
      "Very cool & fun concept, the waffle itself was actually pretty good for an establishment in South Beach. I wouldn't say this place looks the \"cleanest\" but it's worth a try once, even if its for the picture."

The staff is pleasant.  The interior is dimly lit for dinner time.",

A great time was had by all.Pros:1. Insane portion sizes (so you're getting a great deal if you're local and want some stellar leftovers to snack on for a few days)2. Best cannolis I've found in Miami!!3. Location - this is convenient for me. I even walked from my apt downtown. Cons:1. Nothing - don't come here if you're on the keto diet or something like that, but this place is a true gem and a value star when it comes to good food AND lots of it.",

      "This place is an overall (3/5)Ambiance (4/5)At 4pm on a Saturday it was packed.  We were.  The hostess greets you with a smile and the vibe is great.  Full of locals and tourists.  The venue is a bit hidden in a corner with valet and street parking (metered).  Good for small and large groups, families, dates.  Casual vibe.Service (5/5) wonderful my order was taken promptly, my food arrived promptly and my server was happy and helpful. Food (3/5) portions are huge here. I saw a family of four share an entree and just got an extra side of pasta.  We ordered the truffle pizza and the chicken parmasan.  Both were easily large enough for two people per dish.  They were both good but nothing exceptional (3/5) The cannoli for desssert was good (4/5).",

      "YES! I always heard about \"Crust\" but hadn't made my way to it - WOW! I UNDERSTAND THE HYPE! My parents will both be celebrating their birthday next month (Jan 18/19) and I hope to come here! THE PLACE: This restaurant is tucked away, and if you don't know its there, you would easily pass by it. Street parking & valet is available. Inside, it is small, cozy and demonstrates Miami's old architecture. There are tables inside and on the front patio. THE FOOD: For food, I had the Mediterranean Salad 5/5 super fresh and well-balanced. Appetizer, Pan-fried Mozzarella (triangles?) 4/5 thick and gooey. Chicken Piccata over basil Risotto 5/5 outstanding and so savory!! Tiramisu 5/5 perfection! All portions are HUGE and clearly made with love.  THE SERVICE: The waiter was nice and helpful, but the owner was fantastic! She was working non-stop and always had a smile on her face. As a note, one thing I didn't like but will not count against because maybe it was only this day - between the kitchen and the inside tables, there is a small plexiglass side division. When eating all the waiters would stand there and converse with each other and watch you eat. It felt odd and invasive.",

      "Crust is easily one of my favorite restaurants to visit when I come home. For this visit however, 4 stars. I normally love the customer service and genuine hospitality and have never had any issues in the past. My family planned a small birthday dinner for me with a party of 8.  Reservations were made and we were able to enjoy our meal as we always do. Then things went a little south, it was a weeknight and we were almost done, well before closing as I kept track of the time. We were one of the last parties there. However, while we were placing food into to-go boxes, thanking the servers and owners, a very sly comment was made to the tune of \"We close at 10pm.\" I honestly was so shocked this was aimed at our party that I didn't even respond and quickly headed out with the last of my family. It was a small comment, but definitely not something I expected and was pretty shocked by to be honest. It left a sour taste in my mouth and it's going to take me a while to find myself dining here again.",
      "We popped in for a Friday night dinner, reservations definitely needed! The space was adorable, date night would be perfect here. Our server was Bo, he took great care of us! When they tell you the portions are HUGE, they mean it. The wine was delicious as well. All our entrees were perfection, exactly what we asked for. Desserts were also amazing, our sweet tooth required 2 options and it was perfect. I will definitely be coming back!",

My husband has had Crust on his list of restaurants to try and we were just so impressed. Just walking in the door was a good experience, we were greeted in such a warm and welcoming way, they addressed that it was my bday and the baby on the way- it just made it a bit more personal, which was nice. The food- flawless. We tried the meatballs, shrimp cakes, Truffled Pizza, and Linguine Carbonara and for dessert, the Zeppolis with Nutella. Everything we tried was superb and I can honestly say that this may have been the best meal I've ever experienced.",
      "Thank you! We really appreciate it.",
      "Crust has been on my list of places to try in Miami for a while. I highly recommend making a reservation online, it has limited seating. We were greeted warmly and wished a happy anniversary multiple times after making a note of it when making the reservation. The atmosphere is quaint and has an intimate European feel. Our waiter was great and made recommendations for every course.HIGHLIGHTS:- Chicken Parmesan- award winning and gigantic. Amazingly tasty and traditional. The portion size could have fed three people so I got to take home lots of leftovers! - Lobster Ravioli- so flavorful and succulent in a tasty cream sauce. Highly recommend!- The owner brought over two complimentary samples of port wine as a cheers and thank you. It was much appreciated and a nice touch.LET DOWNS:- The drink menu has a large selection of wines, there are only a couple cocktail options. We both went with the mojito which was pretty tart and lime heavy. My boyfriend liked it but it was too tart for my liking.- The fried calamari is their most popular appetizer but I thought it was disappointing. It wasn't very flavorful and had some spicy pickled veggies on top which I didn't think were a good compliment. OVERALL:I'd love to come back here! I especially want to try the pizza.",

I don't have enough words....The salmon pasta was well seasoned & had a lil spice to it. My friend LOVED the Philly cheese pizza & jerk chicken Mac & cheese. Overall, we'll be back before our trip to Miami ends.",
      "Stopped by this place on my husband and I's first day in Miami and it did not disappoint once the food was delivered. When we first walked in, no one greeted us and staff didn't say \"hi\" or anything. Only talked to the walk ins for pick up at first which was quite annoying. After maybe 5-10 minutes, our waiter greeted us and then sat us down. Once we were situated, our server was super friendly, hilarious, and most importantly informative on the food options. I decided to go with the five cheese Mac and cheese with chicken and my husband had the jerk chicken with Mac and cheese. Both were quite good. Mine was a little toasty on top though. Sweet cornbread was delicious - perfectly sweet and the melted butter on the side is the perfect addition. We also ordered the mango lemonade which was very sweet and very good.",
      "It looks awesome, the place is such a vibe of its own. Marketing is on spot for it. Food wise, maybe it's just not my style. I loved mac n cheese as a kid but never was a staple in an Argentinean home. Mac n cheese is comfort food and feels like boxed Mac. If you're coming come for the big flavors like Philly Steak (the best) and Buffalo Chicken. Pizza flavor was something kids could enjoy.Loved loved loved the tater tots felt like a dessert.Interesting Mac n cheese balls, good flavor. Then had the freshly squeezed lemonade with mango and I'd challenge that it's freshly squeezed.",
      "4 star food, 5 star service, 4 star ambience:  Good but pricey Southern comfort food in a small place that, as the name implies, has greta variations on mac n' cheese.4 star food:  The food is very good but pricey for what it turns out to be.  Lobster mac n cheese is great but a little too cheesy for me and at $30 a little too pricey for me.  Sweet potato tots are good but coated with sugar...a little too much of a good thing.  You don't come here for health food, and most of what they offer is worth the extra minutes on the Stairmaster : )5 star service: They have warm and friendly service without a trace of Miami 'tude.  Staffers were helpful explaining things and checking about food allergies too.4 star ambience:  It's a smallish space that can feel a little crowded on most days.  It's happy trouble for a restaurant to have, but it feels a little too busy and slightly rushed.",
      "I would like to say the staff here is amazing, and the atmosphere is super welcoming and enjoyable. It definitely feels like a place that puts time and effort into the product they produce. Strawberry Lemonade was so delicious and extremely sweet, which i personally love. It's also made in house and bottled up which is pretty cool especially if you want to take your drink to go. I ordered the philly mac and cheese with steak and it truly felt like eating a philly cheesesteak with mac and cheese rather than a merging of the two dishes. The portions were more than enough, i even took some home for next day lunch. I did enjoy my meal and would love to come here again but when i'm heavily craving mac and cheese. They do have other menu options that looked tasty, so i might give those a try as well.",
      "Let me start by saying, I am a Mac and cheese addict and also a self proclaimed Mac and cheese snob. I would argue that no one's is better than mine and therefore, I generally do not eat it out! Well, I am a changed woman!!! This place is awesome! Get the sampler. It allows you to choose from 3 of the \"classics.\" The regular is AMAZING but the chicken cordon blue will make you loose your mind! You are welcome in advance Make sure to your the entire spot so you don't miss out on any of the awesome artwork.",
      "Baby!!! I did not know what to expect from this place but it was the best place I ate in Miami the whole week I was there. The Mac and cheese balls pictured were absolutely delicious. That was a great way to start off the meal and they were complimentary. We had a sampler platter for the Mac. I can't even remember what we had I know I had a jerk chicken Mac ... maybe a chicken parm Mac and I can not remember the rest of the macs we ordered because we ate so fast lol! Oh and we had the wings habanero honey or something like that. The customer service was great the waitresses were so funny and nice. Surprisingly they had security at the door we couldn't just walk in he had to go back inside and see if they could take us but it was only 8pm so we thought that was weird. Also it wasn't packed. I never give 5 stars but this place earned it! I will be back!",
      "Thank you! Appreciate the great review! Yes our security checks avail based on reservation list.. sometimes we look avail but we have tables saved for the reservations coming .. glad we had space for you guys to eat right away!",
      "I came while on vacation and heard about this place from social media figured I would give it a try. There was paid street parking all over, which was good. I came inside and it was pretty empty. But it was clean and food came very quickly. The cashier was relatively nice too. I had the World Famous Five Cheese Truffle Mac & cheese (Five cheese truffle mac & cheese topped with cheddar jack cheese, bread crumbs & baked to golden brown). I took it to go. Man, it was so good. Real cheesy, crispy top, very savory and rich. I would definitely come back and there is a few more things I wanted to try like; PARMESAN TRUFFLE FRIES, PARMESAN TRUFFLE FRIES, JERK CHICKEN MAC & CHEESE, SMOKED BBQ CHICKEN MAC & CHEESE AND PIZZA MAC & CHEESE. (I know the whole menu right lol oh well, I can't wait until I'm back down there)",
      "Saw all of the celebrities pictures on the wall and realized this place would either be really bad or really good. I'm glad it was the latter. The place specializes in max and cheese that baked with a variety of toppings. I got the Philly cheesecake mac and cheese and it was great. All the Mac and cheese comes out on a cast iron pan and super gooey and tasty. The portion is a little small, but it's 2022 and a lot of restaurants are subject to shrinkflation. I would say an app or fries and a Mac and cheese would be a complete meal for an average person. They do also do an auto gratuity of 18% which is pretty standard in Miami. Would love to come back to this place.",
      "Everything was so perfect, we will definitely be back! The cheesesteak pizza, wings, meatballs/pasta, fried Mac and cheese balls and fries were all delicious."

      "When in Downtown Miami and you're looking for a good spot for breakfast look no further than Borsalino. I first discovered this place while looking for something different for breakfast, something other than the Same Ol'. Located on 1st Avenue just South of Flagler Street, Borsalino is a welcomed addition to the downtown landscape. The Street is busy and can be a bit of sensory overload but this place is a quiet oasis from the downtown hustle. They have a very nice menu with standard cafe fare and a couple of surprises with a twist or two. The eggs Benedict selections are very delicious and they have one nicest hollandaise sauces' I had in a long time. The coffee is FANTASTIC! Although some enter and expect to have their favorite Corporate Coffee items but they are not here. Brush up on your coffee vocabulary because that Corporate Coffee Nomenclator is not understood at Borsalino. Now, if you want to grab some coffee while cigarette smoke is wafting towards your face, by all means stop at one of the many sidewalk cafes with \"windows on the world\" downtown. But if you want an absolutely fantastic cup of cafe, in a wonderful atmosphere...head to Borsalino Miami.",
      "Very nice ambiance and good coffee. Plenty of seating and free wifi to get some work done. The vibes in the sitting area are very cozy and nice for spending some time.Coffee is good. I had an iced lavender latte and the lavender flavor was on point. It's pricey though, and they add a hefty surcharge for vegan milks. I asked my server twice if oat milk was extra and he said no twice, so I wasn't stoked to find it's a whole extra dollar on top of already pricey coffee.Would still come back. The value isn't great, but it's still a nice experience and the coffee is good.",
      "Went here after returning Avis car rental which is across the street. It was around 8:30 AM and most places were closed. So happy this one opened up as we approached. We had time to kill as our cruise check-in doesn't start until 11 AM. Service is courteous and prompt. Food came out in appropriate time and everything was presented well. We ordered Borsalino breakfast sandwich, salmon eggs Benedict, short rib tartine, egg breakfast which came with eggs, toast, bacon and potatoes. Quality of food is good for the price.",
      "Had some time for lunch while waiting for my flight home from a cruise and found this cafe nearby. Cute decor and super cozy inside. I ordered their Cajun Salmon Quinoa Bowl. It looked great and tasted even better! It was super fresh and had so much flavor. The pesto in the dish was awesome. What a great casual lunch spot!",
      "I've never had a bad experience at Borsalino! I come here often to eat while I work and it's a comfortable space to be productive while eating a flavorful meal. I typically enjoy a delicious iced macchiato during my meal, but can't leave without taking a fresh squeezed juice with me. Pictured is Thomas Juice; I love it! With the combination of my meal, coffee, and juice I leave feeling full and energized! There is never a long wait to be seated and food comes out quickly. Causal and clean establishment.",
      "Absolutely gorgeous cafe with really amazing croissants and lattes. Great service as well!",
      "If you are looking for a place in Miami Downtown to have a nice healthy lunch. Borsalino is the place :Location: 119 SE First Ave Miami, FL  33130United StatesNice ambiance, I met with a real estate client for a coffee here and then I end up staying and doing some more work on my computer while I was having lunch. Place is cleanService is nice Food was goodCoffees were also goodThe level of music is perfect, not too loud not too low :-)I had a cappuccino and later on a chicken bowl. Both very goodI have also had before the avocado toast. It is delicious!!!!",
      "Hidden gem in downtown Miami offering a wide variety of food items: freshly squeezed juices, coffee, salads, bowls, sandwiches, eggs, and pastries.  I was pleasantly surprised with a large number of healthy options and pretty reasonable prices for downtown Miami.   I was hoping to get a seat inside which has a very nice ambiance, but they were completely full on a Saturday afternoon. The four of us ordered drinks (coffee and juices) and various entrees.   Our collective food rating is below:1.  Cuban sandwich -  \"great taste and elegant\"2.  Ahi tuna bowl -  tuna was served on a bowl of cauliflower rice and was well seasoned3.  Ahi tuna salad -  we tried to find differences between this one and the bowl - basically the same thing except \"salad\" version had tuna on top of quinoa.  I expected it to have more salad leaves, etc.  it was good but not a salad 4.  Egg dish -  not shown in the pictures. My friend found it too salty and she did not finish it.  Overall:  healthy food options, great service, great ambiance, great location -  I will be back.",
      "Price: $5-$18Vibe: super cute and cozy cafe!Food: the presentation of the food to the taste of the food was delicious. They have a variety of unique dishes that makes their restaurant stand out from typical brunch spots in Miami. Drinks: bottomless mimosas and Bellinis for 15$Outdoor/ indoor seatingCoffee bar I highly recommend this restaurant for work space during the week and order a yummy latte or fresh squeezed juice. They have cozy seating and WiFi if you just need a change in scenery when working from home! I've been to brunch on Saturday and a Sunday and it doesn't disappoint. The owner is so sweet and the staff was really attentive every time I have been.",
      "So glad we found this place on our trip to Miami, sat on the street to people watch but the inside ambiance looked very nice as well. We ordered the truffle egg and potatoes and the salmon croissant. Both had great food presentation and were incredible (sorry husband dug into his before I could snap a pic). Both tasted great and were very satisfying.Adding this one to the short list of places we need to come back to next time.Overall great place and great value for the money"

      "Amazing food and service! Beto Jr the goat. I got chicken francese and it was very tasty and the prices are reasonable",
      "This is by far my favorite Italian restaurant in Miami. I have been fortunate enough to come here twice, and both times were fabulous. This is a smaller restaurant on Miracle Mile, but don't let the smaller storefront fool you! The service here is excellent, and so friendly. It makes me feels like I'm in little Italy in NYC or Boston. The waiters are all attentive and make great menu suggestions. We started with the fried provolone. I love that it came atop a nice little arugula salad with balsamic. It paired nicely with the rolls and bruschetta that they bring to your table once you sit down. For our meals we had the lasagna and the fettuccine alla papalina. The lasagna was probably the best I've every had. At least there is nothing I can remember that comes close. It was so fresh and flavorful, and a great portion! It didn't even feel heavy. The fettuccine was also so fresh and light, despite having a cream sauce. The flavor was phenomenal. We finished off our meal with the apple crostata for dessert. We probably could have done without it since we were already pretty full, but it was a nice ending to our meal.They have a great wine list, but honestly their wines by the glass are great. We ordered a bottle of wine our first time, but this time we just got 2 glasses of the Cabernet and it was delicious.Overall, everything about Fratellino is wonderful. From the food, to the service to the vibe here. I look forward to returning in the future.",
      "This restaurant has been on my go-to list pre pandemic and at least several years (while I was living in nyc). Overall (4/5)Venue (3/5) the venue has indoor and outdoor seating.  There were all types of clientele: small and large groups, families, dates... there were people dressed very chic and others casual.  Nice mix of clientele.  The decor reminded me of the nyc Italian restaurants....plenty of pictures/photos hung up on the wall of the owners families.  Food (4/5)Bolognese (fettuccine we ordered this pasta with the sauce) (4/5) it was good...not the best I have had but good. Linguine with clams (3/5) this was ok. I've had much better.  It was beautiful to look at but the dish was meh.  Bread (5/5) wow..... I love the bread here.  It's spectacular!Service (5/5) the BEST here.  You order something and it comes right away with a smile.",
      "AMAZING! Where to start, from the service to the food 5 stars!The lasagna bolognese was the best lasagna I have ever had. I never finish my plate of food but this disappeared right off my plate! And the best part you don't feel overly stuffed. Everything tastes so fresh, a party in your mouth! Best Italian food in south Florida!",
      "I would have lost the bet. I thought I already wrote a review for this most amazing family restaurant. Most definitely make a reservation two weeks in advance. The place is small, the walls are lined with family photos and you are treated like family. There is indoor and outdoor seating. If it's cold out, they have the heaters outside. Go with a hardy appetite so you can try a lot. What we do is order entrees for appetizers and try them. Then we order dinner. We have never had a bad bite here. Everything is made fresh and in house. Junior is attentive and his team is just as amazing. The have champagne, wine and beer. If you must have a cocktail, go early and have a cocktail at one of the places within walking distance and then go settle in for a delicious experience. The bathroom was clean. The floors and doors are clean. They use white tablecloths for their setting. This is a great place for a family dinner, or a romantic night out. I really hope you give them a try. You won't regret it! Oh! And for dessert we shared tiramisu and the most decadent chocolate mousse. We will be back soon, no doubt. Enjoy!",
      "My team visited Fratellino for a quick lunch celebration, and we had the best time! After seeing this restaurant on Yelp's Top 100 list, I made sure to plan a visit. You'll walk into a homey environment with decades of family photos lined along the wall.My team of about 8 was quickly seated and served. Our waiter gladly helped us with wine selection, providing more free bread, and recommending dishes. Every single person enjoyed their meal and had leftovers! At the end, our waiter gave us two complimentary slices of tiramisu to celebrate. For the experience, I 100% recommend!",
      "The super short version... this place is fantastic, best Italian food in a long time and you have to try it. Please call ahead to make a reservation, they are super busy. If you have more time, read on. I love to go to the best Italian restaurants in all the cities we visit, always in hopes of finding \"the place\" that makes me feel transported back to all the wonderful times I had in Italy growing up. This is it!!! The warmth, the charm, the people, the food... this place has it all. Beto is a wonderful host and makes people feel at home, as if you are family. Andres our server was a gem and was super attentive and helpful in choosing our dinner and you could see that everyone loves what they are doing as the team worked like clock work.Now to the food, we came multiple days in a row even though I had a long list of places I wanted to try, that's how good it is!!!! We had the antipasto platter, the fried calamari and fried mozzarella special for starters and all of them were simply delicious. Our favorite was definitely the fried mozzarella, man that sauce and the gooey cheese were dynamite. They also serve a \"do it yourself bruschetta\" with every table, great warm bread with tomatoes to top it off. Main courses we tried were the seafood linguini special, the osso bucco, lasagna, fettuccine Papalina, vitello ai tre funghi and the lobster ravioli special. I mean all of them were amazing, but the standouts were the osso bucco and the lobster ravioli, simply because you don't eat those dishes often and if you only come once, those are THE dishes to try. Dessert was also yummy, the tiramisu was fluffy and light, the apple tart wonderful and the chocolate cake a slam dunk. The chocolate cake is super rich, that one might need 4 people to share. I was sad to leave and I'm still sad that this restaurant is so so far away, it's been an epic experience and I'm definitely looking forward to come back.",

      "Another amazing date night at Fratellino! To my surprise Beto was not there. However, I am so pleased to say that the place ran just as smoothly! This speaks volumes of how well this establishment is managed. We did miss Beto's infectious humor and as usual we will be back. No other place has our heart or keeps us coming back as much as Fratellino! Thank you so much for the wonderful dining experience and all the memories!",
      "Fratellino without a doubt continues to be our go to date night spot. The service is outstanding, the attention to detail immaculate and the craftsmanship in which the menu is prepared is unlike anything else I have ever tasted. I am so happy that Beto and his team have been able to withstand the test of time. No matter the circumstances we are living in Fratellino will surpass your expectations.",
      "Ok. The Beginning. Fratellino is easily my favorite restaurant (I don't throw those words around easily) . Perfect for any occasion. This is our first time here since the quarantine began and I really can't tell you enough how perfect the dining experience was. We had reservations at 7:30 pm on the patio since we can only dine out right now due to Covid. Despite the weather and the heat it was surprisingly comfortable since they have plenty of ceiling fans. Beto (the owner) is so personable and he makes you feel at home. You can definitely taste the love the whole staff puts into making your dining experience a memorable one.The climax.We ordered a bottle of the house Sauvignon Blanc to start. It was light and crisp. Perfect for the summer heat. Then as an app we ordered the beef carpaccio. It was citrusy yet not pungent, the bed of arugula salad brought all the flavors together. As the main dish my husband went with something more classic, the lasagna. I opted out for the home made spinach fettuccini with shrimp. Both perfectly cooked and deliciously made. Throughout our meal Beto's jokes and fun loving conversation topics sparked a fun atmosphere. One thing led to another and we decided to order another bottle of wine. Then, out of nowhere Beto brought a complimentary Apple tart. Wow, what a treat! Then we ordered 2 cappuccinos, it was the perfect ending to our dinner. Las Gracias.We wanted to thank you Beto and your staff for giving my husband and I a night of normalcy in the midst of so much negativity. We love you all and we will definitely be back soon.",
      "Wow! This little spot is amazing! A friend of ours and her husband invited us to come for dinner on a Saturday evening. The service was outstanding even with the restaurant being completely full. The owner is very personable, friendly and attentive. The restaurant has a very romantic vibe to it the lighting is perfect as well. Let me talk about the food! Speechless! I had the lobster ravioli. What a delight! The dessert was delicious as well and their wine selection is extensive. We will definitely be coming back here again.",
      "I am so disappointed with \"YELP\". You would ask why? We drove all the way from Sunny Isles to Coral gables to experience this 1500+ 5 star review restaurant...I hope Yelp Managemet is monitoring my review.We were 2 couples and we all hated the quality of the food.Ossobuco was horrible and the pasta was uncooked.I know what andante is.... No this was uncooked.As we were leaving I used the restroom and you have to pass by the kitchen... if I saw that kitchen I would have walked out of that restaurant...Was very small and looked dirty.I am still wondering how this place got 5 star reviews from 1500....we really lost our trust in \"Yelp\"."

      "We stopped by on a Friday night. It was very quiet. But we didn't let that dissuade us because we really enjoyed this place. Service was friendly and quick. We got ramen. I thought the shoyu ramen was good. It's a little clearer that some of the broths I'm used to but the flavor help up well. It has generous portions of all the things good in a ramen including noodles, nori, two eggs, pork belly, mushroom, fish cake and more. Ask for the chili oil. We also got the fried chicken. Don't miss that. It was lighter than I was expecting but just delish. Minor complaint is that the app came out the same time as ramen. I prefer it as a starter but so be it. Enjoyed it very much.",

The Hell Broth Ramen is delicious and spiced perfect, my wife loved the Pad Thai, and Thai donuts were a hit. Stop by for a great lunch or dinner.",

      "Tried this place out because it was the closet non-fastfood place to the Marriot I was staying at, at first glance I thought it was a Cuban restaurant from a distance and only realized what it was when I got closer.The place is pretty small but the waitress was quick to have me seated and hand me a menu, was torn between what I got and the ramen, but utimately decided to try something new.During the entire time I was browsing the menu the waitress continued to be a one man show, seating other customers and delivering food and drink all by self, all the while making small talk with her guest, providing exceptional customer service.The food was out pretty fast and in a fairly large portion size too, it wasn't too spicy and was extremely tasty, now that I know this place is nearby I'm going to come back again in the future to try their other menu items.",

      "I'm on a quest for good broth with a depth of flavor and noodles right now! I actually enjoyed the food at the FIU location but shared my disappointment regarding the overall cleanliness of that location...the Coral Gables location was the exact opposite. Clean from the door to the table. I did not visit the lavatory but I plan to return and check those important details soon! I remain a fan of the food. Decided to order the exact same - Hell's Ramen and chicken karaage. Actually a tad spicier than the FIU meal. I'm a fan of spice so that works for me. My date enjoyed his udon bowl and bao buns. We both enjoyed a pot of hot green tea! One young man in the front of house. He worked up to 4 tables and provided take out services to customers. He was overwhelmed from time to time but he managed. It may be helpful to have a little assistance when restaurant is busy. I would have ordered dessert but it felt like I was adding to the burdens of the lone waiter. Definitely will return to this location in the near future.",

      "Really loved this place! Went for brunch with a friend and was not disappointed! I always love a brunch with a unique menu, and this place had some super cool options. Our incredible server recommended the chilaquiles with yucca chips and I couldn't resist! It was very filling with so much flavor and multiple sauces that have a great kick. I also got the Marvin the Martian cocktail, another great option over your typical mimosa. The drink was refreshing and tasted like a green juice you'd get at a smoothie place, but the tequila was a welcome addition! I can't quite remember the name of the dish my friend got, but I have to call out the amazing bacon she got on the side. It was served in a large uncut slab, charred on the outside and so delicious we ate every last bite.Did I mention our server was awesome?! I don't recall their name but they were friendly, gave great recommendations, and offered to take our picture which was all very appreciated. The restaurant itself was very pretty and great for insta snaps! We sat inside, but the large outdoor patio looked heavenly with umbrellas and lots of greenery to block that Miami sun!",
      "Just went January 6, 2023, and it is still great. Have been before maybe 7-8 years back, and they are still consistent. Tapas style small plates.We had the Cauliflower, BURRATA, YELLOW JACK CEVICHE, Spanish Octopus, and the Hanger Steak, and not even exaggerating every single one was fabulous!! Great to have a meal that was a lighter portion, but HUGE flavors and taste! It's clear they put a lot of effort into their food.Definitely recommended!!",
      "We live in DC, and we are always excited to visit Beaker & Gray when we're in Miami. The cocktails are well done but the food is really the shining star of this restaurant.I've been dreaming of the smoked rib fried rice since I left! High fives all around --",

There's a nice seating area outside but we chose inside because south Florida is back to being south Florida after this short lived winterThe food was amazing. I did send my burger back initially because it had pickles; apparently not all ingredients are listed on the menu. Be sure to tell all your allergies or dislikes. Other than that, food was great. Wings were super delicious. The mixed greens that came with my burger were flavorful. I was loving the salad, surprisingly lol. And the burger did not disappoint. I'd definitely give them a try if in the area.",
      "My partner and I had a phenomenal experience at B&G over the weekend. We came in for cocktails and were lucky enough to snag 2 seats at the bar, where we were greeted by the bartender, Domingo.He gave us some fantastic recommendations and even customized a few cocktails for us based on our preferences! My personal favorite was a variation on an espresso martini, which had tasting notes of pistachio as well. But honestly, all of the drinks were incredible and I have a feeling you can't go wrong. Really friendly service, delicious drinks, cool atmosphere. Definitely recommend!",
      "Super good Midnight In Paris drink and also loved the Hamachi and smoked rib fried rice. iWe also ordered the gnocchi but we ate it too fast to take a photo. The fried rice and Midnight in Paris was my favorite. My husband liked the gnocchi the best. Ps Our server Brett was on it!",
      "Delicious! I've driven past so many times but never stopped in - I'm so glad we finally had an opportunity to.Our service was wonderful and the ambiance was dark and moody. A great spot for a girls night or romantic dinner. The drinks were wonderful, and they allowed me to turn a non spicy drink spicy which I always appreciate. I also had their espresso martini which had a sweet pistachio crumble on top.The food was amazing, we ordered several plates and shared them around the table.",
      "This place has a great vibe and had a live dj when I came. It was a bit loud and the atmosphere is pretty dark so it was kind of difficult to see what you're eating. Food comes out like tapas so dishes came out as they were ready vs all at once. Chicken wings: I'd give this 5 stars! Super juicy, sweet and a little tangy with perfectly crisp skin. The waiter recommended this dish and it was definitely delicious. Yellow curry: I'd give this 5 stars! There's a little kick of spice, but it's really good. You can definitely taste the creamy coconut and it paired perfectly with the salty pork in the dish. Pumpkin gnocchi: I'd give this dish 3.5 stars. It was good overall but just wasn't for me. I couldn't taste the pumpkin. The gnocchi was cooked very well but the beef it came with didn't seem to pair well for my taste buds. My sister liked this dish though.",

      "Seaspice was amazing. It's a fantastic restaurant with a great view right on the Miami River. If you don't right you can catch the live music as the sun sets, and the restaurant transforms to a lounge. Totally worth coming Parking is tricky, and if you're not paying attention you might miss it as you drive by. But it's a gem worth coming back to.",
      "Seaspice is known to Miami locals as a very high end resturant, frequented by celebrities.  I have no idea why.  The service is pretty awful.  The drink runners are horrible.  It takes about 30 minutes for just a drink to be brought out to you.  The food is mediocre.  It is definitely NOT worth the price, which is very expensive.  I am giving two stars because the view is amazing.  Seaspice is right on the water and has a gorgeous ambiance.  You can watch yachts drive by and some will even pull up and park.  The other star is for the tres leches.  This dessert was AMAZING, I would go back just to eat it again.  But otherwise, Seaspice is nothing special.  Save your money.",
      "A place that tries to be high end but fails to deliver.Service ? Mediocre Food ? Below parFirst thing when you check in is they tell you that you have a 2 hr max(tacky)",
      "I read this was one of the best patio dining AND a hot spot for celebrities in Miami, so I had to go check it out on our recent travels to this area...Initially I was worried about our luggage situation, as we had to carry our luggage to the restaurant since this was our last stop in Miami. However, they were very accommodating, and let us store some of our stuff in the closet, and we kept the big luggage with us, near our table.As expected, the patio scene was spectacular...city skyline and seaside views, with plenty of yachts passing by! The place indeed had that chic celebrity vibe...truly FAB! Loved the music overhead as well. Somehow, I expected some snobbiness...but not at all. Service was great!Then the food. OMFG...I've had some amazing foods lately, but this takes the cake. Even the complimentary bread was amazing (and unique)! My husband ordered this Wagyu Burger, and I chose this Ragu Pappardelle ( THE best Ragu Pappardelle I've ever had...EVER. ). Then this Pavola dessert...again, just beyond delish. Truly, this was foods for the celebrities.Honestly, I'm shocked at how low the rating is for this place. I assume that if the service isn't top notch, it would probably piss some folks off. The pricing was on the outlandish side...with even lunch entrees starting at around 40. There was even an appetizer item priced at around 70 bucks! Luckily, like I said, I felt that the foods and the service (and especially the spectacular ambiance) made up for it. There was this big yacht parked right near us, which somewhat blocked some of the views from the left. Still, we got our eyeful of seaside/yachtside views.In any case, this was a great way to end our trip in Miami.",
      "Went here with a group of girlfriends for brunch and everything was delicious, they were super accommodating as well.I had the froze , a cucumber and gin cocktail and 2 grey goose and sodas and all were fantastic.As a table we split the fresh fish and a couple sides and it was delicious. Also love the free bread It is definitely on the pricier side overall tbh but great for a fun \"fancy\" brunch",
      "Came here for Miami spice and although we spent more than we thought we would, we had a good time. Everything was delicious. The kale Caesar had pecans and Granny Smith apple slices, never had a Caesar like this but it was a nice change! The Shrimp Pesto Whole Wheat Spaghetti was my favorite, even though I'm not the biggest fan of pesto. The burger was good too just a little messy from the truffle aioli. The chocolate cremoso and tres leches was very good but I'd go with the cremoso for the cocoa nib crumble, yum! All in all, I think it's overpriced and I probably won't come here again because of that. The cheapest bottle of Chardonnay was $75 and most drinks were $20. I only came here for Miami spice and still spent almost $200.",
      "Given we still have Miami Spice going on until the end of the month we decided to try out the lunch menu @ Seaspice gorgeous location on the Miami River, sitting outdoor is really relaxing, so beautiful to watch the boats go by, really lovely To start we had the Comte' Cheese Soufflé, I have to admit this was a bit disappointing, it really did not have the texture of a real soufflé  but then............ the Shrimp Pesto Whole Wheat Spaghetti and the Pan-Seared Chilean Seabass were really good as dessert, both the Tres Leches and the Chocolate Cremoso were yummy Try it out before Miami Spice ends, you can check out the Miami Spice Menus on miamiandthebeaches.com@seaspicemia",
      "First time for me at Seaspice, it is located on the banks of the Miami River it is a gem that you should not miss. Sit outside in the courtyard enjoy your food and a drinks while watching the boats go by, just beautiful We had the Miami Spice lunch which has a very affordable fix price 3 course menu for $ 28, unfortunately this will end soon, nevertheless, I would defiantly go back again for sureRegarding the Miami Spice menu only one observation, they should have had more than one choice for the Entrees without the extra charge, right now you have 4 choices and 3 of these have extra charge on it, not really fair given that you are promoting the Spice menu, you should have at least two or three choices included in the price and one or two with the extra charge We had had Prince Edward Island Mussels, Grilled, the Grilled Faroe Island Salmon and the Profiteroles and Peaches and Cream. My favorite where the Mussels, the garlic pizza bread they brought for the table was absolutely delicious, the Salmon was good too. I had the Peaches for dessert and it was ok, not really my thing, my friend said the Profiteroles were great, next time I will not opt for the healthy dessert We enjoyed all with a good Albariño wine, our experience was made especially enjoyable by our waiter Fabrizio, he was really great ! Thank you Fabrizio @seaspicemia",
      "Bad first impression. Its not a nice feeling to feel like you have to beg to spend your money at a restaurant. Every year I look forward to Miami Spice. It's a great way to try out various restaurants and a unique spread of menu options. Seaspice was on my radar and happened to be one of the participating restaurants offering the Miami Spice menu. I contacted the restaurant in advance and made a reservation for 3:30p for a party of four. My mom who is from out of town was excited to join us for lunch. I advised the restaurant we were doing the Miami Spice menu. The restaurant made it clear that they charge $50pp for No Shows. At 3:15pm, we arrived for our reservation. The hostess Karin greeted us, and advised us that they were running behind on the reservations and because of this they will not be able to offer the Miami Spice menu. Only the a la-carte menu will be offered. This was a bit upsetting because we drove almost an hour to get there and the restaurant is refusing to offer the Miami Spice promotion. Our natural instinct was to just say forget it we will go somewhere else. I mean, at the end of the day who wants to beg to spend their money? It's absurd. If the restaurant is offering a promotional menu and because to no fault of our own they are running behind why should we be penalized?My Mom looked so bummed out. Because she was so excited to try this place. I decided to walk back in and ask for a Manager. The Manager took 20min to come out. When he finally did come over, he introduced himself as Collin. I explained to him what was going on and it seemed as though he wasn't aware that the hostesses were turning Miami Spice customers away. He decided to make it right and advised Karin to honor the Miami Spice menu. Impressive! Things were turning around. Besides the encounter at the hostess stand, the restaurant is beautiful. It is situated on Miami's waterfront were you can view the million dollar yachts passing by. They also have docks for those interested in docking and dining. You can view the downtown city skyline which I am sure looks amazing at night.The food was excellent. The Miami Spice menu offered a three course lunch for $28. You have the choice of a starter (Kale Salad, Cheese Souffle, or White Gazpacho). A choice of entrees (Seabass, Chicken Breast, Shrimp Pesto Pasta, Wagyu Burger, or Plant Bowl). And a choice of dessert (Tres Leches or Chocolate Cremoso). They also offer the option to add a Glass of wine for and additional $12. I ordered the Comte Cheese Souffle, the Green Circle Farms Chicken Breast, and the Tres Leches. The others in my party ordered the Kale Salad, Gazpacho, and Seabass. For starters, My favorites were the Kale Caesar Salad and Cheese Souffle. The Kale Caesar had a mix of shredded Granny Smith apples, pecans and a creamy Caesar dressing. The cheese Souffle was like a fluffy egg Souffle with a cream parmesan sauce and tomato chutney. Delicious!For entrees, both the Seabass and Chicken breast were amazing. The Chicken breast was tender and juicy, served on top of a creamy polenta and topped with corn, peas, and mushrooms. The seabass was seared nicely to give a nice crunch on the outside, while perfectly flaky and moist on the inside. It was served with stewed garbanzo, Swiss chard, and smoked potato. For desserts, we all had Tres Leches. It was served in a small Mason jar topped with 3 milks, and berries. Perfect way to end the meal. The portions are not large but it is filling. The flavors are fresh and very well balanced. The food presentation was notable. The Watermelon Tequila drink was delightful and refreshing. The froze was also a big hit. The cocktails were presented well and created perfectly. We enjoyed everything. Our waiter, Austin was very friendly. He made great recommendations and was very attentive.An 18% gratuity was added to the tab. There are lots of street parking accessible. In the end, the food was great. Ambience was amazing. The hostesses can use additional customer service training and learn to use better judgment to improve the customers experience. There was no need to escalate the matters to a manager. It could have been handled properly by showing empathy, apologizing, and finding a solution to the problem.",
      "Hi Kim,Thank you for dining with us and leaving a detailed review. It has been forwarded to our management team. Our apologies for the confusion at the door.  Glad to hear Collin accommodated you and your experience was turned around.  We are happy to see your great feedback regarding the food, cocktails, and Austin’s Service.  Hopefully you will join us again in the near future!",
      "This is my second time going to sea spice & I normally love it as the first time. I never leave bad reviews But this second time MY PHONE WAS STOLEN AND SECURITIES DID NOThing about it. Instead we're trying to blame me for the situation. I'm not drunk nor was drunk. I walked in with 2 phone and walked out with 1.We came as my friend USUALLY does and this is how they treated us  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME. I thought it was 5 star so nothing could go wrong. With a security right next to our table my phone STILLL got stolen. It was on the table. And to whoever has the time to steal phones is just sad imagine what else they can steal... I wil ask to review cameras but with the way I was treated when I let them know I lost my phone I doubt they will be helpful but I'll let every platform form of review know that they steal phones here. I know the exact time frame as well so they wouldn't even have to look much at the cameras. Let's see. BTW I BEEN HOME SICK AFTER EATING THESE OYSTERS I COULDNT Even celebrate my baby's birthday w him.",
      "Came here for my birthday dinner with my boyfriend for a 7:15 reservation (we called in advance for an outdoor seat dock side) we waited about ten minutes after our arrival for our table to be ready at the bar, the short wait was definitely worth it. Started with an aperol spritz at the bar then ordered octopus and gazpacho to start. Octopus portion was good but the olive oil tasted burnt since it came out on a sizzling hot cast iron looking skillet (its very easy to overcook octopus, please just bring a regular plate next time.) I also had the whole main lobster. Extremely delicious large portion of perfectly cooked and seasoned lobster, bravo. My boyfriend had the truffle coated Chilean sea bass and he absolutely loved it. Vibe: 5/5 this place definitely is a scene but not overwhelmingly pretentious or obnoxious. Absolutely loved the music as well. Service:3/5 A bit slow, our server was very attentive when we were able to get his attention but we had to always wave him down. Food: 4/5 everything was honestly pretty good (octopus could've had a bit more attention to detail)",
      "Hi Liz,Thank you for celebrating your birthday with us!  We are so happy to hear you had a great experience and enjoyed the food.  Your feedback regarding the octopus has been sent to our chef. We look forward to seeing you again soon!"

      "Hands down my favorite restaurant in Miami. Ambiance is upbeat and intimate. Food is AMAZING does not miss in the year I've been going consistently. Service is outstanding .",
      "Amazing steakhouse Our favorite was the the Australian Wagyu which I can only say was perfection. their sides were so perfectly complimentary. Truffle Mac and cheese, the Brussels sprouts, spinach, broccolini and cauliflower were excellent. Beef lettuce wraps were decent, beet salad was good, kids meals were devoured. ALSO if you're here for breakfast their buffet is great",
      "WOW - To say I was completely blown away by my first time dining here would be an understatement. Whether you're celebrating a special occasion or just craving a delectable meal that will leave you speechless, this is the spot that will be sure to leave a lasting impression. From the lavish and trendy decor, the out of this world dishes, beautiful presentations and impeccable service, every detail was taken well into consideration and perfected.I can say with certainty that this is one of the most gorgeous spaces I've ever eaten a meal in. The sultry vibe, elegantly designed interior, endless display of wine bottles scattered throughout the restaurant and the stunning bar will have you feeling like you're in the midst of dining amongst celebrities. There didn't seem to be a bad table to dine at in sight, but my parents and I were lucky enough to snag one of the beautiful half-moon booths toward the center of the room. When is the last time you've been to a restaurant that brings complimentary French fries to the table? And not just any regular ole' French fries, but a delicious trio of French fries each complimented by their own unique dipping sauce? Bet it's probably never happened before, unless you've eaten here. I thought this was such a neat but simple touch that really set them apart from other high-end restaurants. They also bring yummy rolls topped with sea salt to the table (between the fries & the bread, you might end up in a food coma before you even order if you're not careful). I ordered the tuna tartar for an appetizer and I was in heaven every time I took a bite. Not only does it melt in your mouth, but the presentation alone is enough reason to order this (the way they mix it for you makes for a fun video opportunity if you have your phone ready to record). My parents shared a shrimp cocktail that they both enjoyed - The shrimp were massive! Following the appetizers, I munched on a cesar salad which was perfectly dressed. Now... the STEAK. Holy moly, one of the best filet mignons I have had yet. It was ridiculously flavorful, tender & juicy. Melted in your mouth and bursted with flavor. If you're a steak lover, it would be a crime to come here and not order it. The mashed potatoes that accompanied it were also flavorful, but I thought they were a little too runny (my only complaint of the whole meal). If you're a fan of grilled onions, do yourself a favor and order a side of these to top your steak with and thank me later. The \"Smoked Chocolate S'mores\" dessert was ridiculously decadent and was the perfect finish to an impeccable meal. Yes, it's insanely pricy and yes, it's totally worth it. My experience here was one of the best dining experiences I've ever had in Miami - And that says a lot given the fact that Miami is one of the hottest spots in the country for foodies. This restaurant hit it out the park for me and I'm already searching for an excuse to go back to South Florida and to savor new dishes on their menu.",
      "The restaurant is spacious and nice. Bar is nice as well.Staff was friendly and attentive.For appetizers the tuna tartare was fresh and seasoned well.They also bring you French fries 3 different ways with 3 different sauces. I had the certified Angus rib cap cooked medium rare and It was good and flavorful. The side of Mac and Cheese was good as well.",
      "Our favorite was the the Australian Wagyu which I can only say was perfection.",
      "Ambiance was awesome. The dishes, coctails and the dessert were so delicious. All the employees were so polite and friendly. They celebrated our honeymoon with a cute card, it was so nice.They made our special day unforgettable.",
      "Wonderful experience! Fabulous service. Timing, everything was a 10.  Our server really made our night fabulous, she was awesome. Great steak, Mac and cheese with truffle was really nice. Molten cake was super good as well. I must say everything was impeccable.",
      "Phenomenal cuisine. Never have a enjoyed such a succulent and flavourful sea bass - it is one of their renowned specials. But the lack of bones in the fish was made up for by the pained bones in my rear.The decor was beautiful but very far from comfortable. The low chairs were too uncomfortable for eating. The benches; built for slaves.The overall experience was truly hampered by a god awful designer deserving of life in prison for her domestic terror on comfort. 4/5 not bad",
      "This plus is amazing! We had a private room & our server was Erin. Erin was very pleasant, patient, informative & very professional. She suggested several appetizers & dinner. It was our first time visiting this restaurant & it definitely won't be our last.",
      "Food was incredible. I love that when you get to the table instead of getting some bread you get french fries. Service was also impeccable and ambiance is very family friendly in my opinion"

If you love Indian food... this is the place for you.   If you aren't familiar with Indian food... this is the place for you to learn.  The staff is great at making suggestions... Varun was our waiter last night and he was great.  Very attentive.  Spot on with his recommendations.  Very friendly and competent.  The food was delicious.  We had three different entrees... two appetizers and dessert.  The portions were a good size and quality ingredients.   Very large vegetarian options too. Wine selection is kinda limited... I plan to bring my own next time and pay a corkage fee.  Our plan is to keep coming back and try all of the entrees.  Highly recommend Indian Spice.",
      "Solid India food and  knowledgeable staff...  definitely worth a visit. The food scene on 79th street from Collins to Biscayne Blvd is really coming alive... worth a trip for casual Foodies.",
      "I previously gave four stars and compliments to this restaurant. However it was many months before we could make it back here, and I am afraid the entire experience has changed, making me wonder if ownership or management is new... the samosas were half the size, the Tikka Masala was a deep red color and tasted EXACTLY like Chef Boyardee Spaghettios from a can (obviously, they just spooned some tomato paste in to make more sauce and didn't even let it cook down to remove the bitterness). And worst of all, the Tandoori Chicken my friends ordered was covered in a thick grainy baste that contained a high level of something tasting like bleach.I am not one for insulting a restaurant for having a bad night, especially after I had such a great experience a few months previous. But the 100% change in food quality across the board was too alarming to let it slide this time. Obviously, nail in the coffin on this place for us. :(Go to Bombay Darbar instead. It's worth the drive to the Grove.",
      "Very sweet owners working and cooking here. Tender, super flavorful tandoori chicken! Delicious mimosas and chutney. Everything was great. This is a reliably good local spot.",
      "Had the chicken Saag which is a cream spinach based masterpiece. I normally do not go for spinach but this is not your regular plate. Varun was my waiter and he said it was the house special, so I took his suggestion and won big time.",
      "Great quality and amount per serving .  Fantastic flavors but ...It is soooooooooo spicy.  Even if you ask for the Mildest. Their \" mild\"  is too hot for the average person . After glasses and glasses of water couldnt finish it . Went home hungry. It's a shame b/c otherwise the food would be excellent. I do not know why do this,  you can always make it hotter for whomever requests it. Instead of loosing 90 % of patrons. That is where Zayka and Darbar get it right, and are always full. Indian food has so many wonderful spices why drown everything with heat instead of making it optional for you to add as much heat as you want.",
      "So Taste Buds of India is under new management and is now Indian Spice. Slightly high prices and small portions because Indian is treated like a delicacy in Miami. The food was delicious though. Service is very good. Interior is bright and clean. They also have a few tables outside in the Normandy Fountain square. They have lunch specials. I'll be back again soon.",
      "Amazing food! Friendly ambiance with a staff that makes you feel at home! Highly recommended!",
      "Super authentic and excellent service. Our server explained us the menu well and was very kind. Will come again soon.",
      "The food was alright but I really enjoyed the atmosphere. I feel like the food could have come a little quicker.",
      "Taste Buds of India..you were my all time favorite restaurant for my Indian food cravings but lately, I don't know what's going on with your food!!!I used to always get the Lamb vindaloo (Extra spicy) and kashmiri naan! Everything about them used to be perfect! The level of spice, the sweetness of the Kashmiri naan, just YUM! However, the last time I ordered from you guys, the lamb vindaloo was mainly just oil and the kashmiri naan was just alright..was a little lighter in the filling but still ok. We sometimes have a bad night so I decided to give you another chance!This time though definitely made me realize this will be the last time I ever order again from here unfortunately! I ordered a lamb tikka masala to change it up and my usual Kashmiri naan. The lamb tikka masala was a tiny portion and tasted like tomato sauce and cream mixed with little bits of meat. I have had better frozen Indian food than that! There were NO vegetables in it at all either. And the Kashmiri naan tasted like a regular naan! There was pretty much NO filling and was super unsatisfactory. So disappointing and what a waste of money :( Hope you guys can get back to the amazing quality you used to serve. But this is my goodbye",
      "Worst $50 delivery I've ever had. \"No onions\" salad loaded with onions. Lamb curry \"mild\" so spicy you could barely taste the meat. It looked like a bowl of spicy red sauce with the small pieces of meat swimming in it. Couldn't tell if it was lamb, dog, goat, with the amount of spicy sauce covering it. Definitely not much of it for the price. No other ingredients in it. Naan bread was unremarkable. On a positive note - jasmine rice was good and delivery took less than 30 min. I think it's because they just microwaved some of the leftovers from the day before, lol. Next time I'll just get a can of Dinty Moore stew from the gas station. Much cheaper and same amount of enjoyment."

The vibe is a little more upscale but still felt casual and welcoming. I ordered the Milanese de carne, which comes with fries already. So yummy, perfectly crispy - both the fries and meat.

They gave complimentary bread, so that was nice. The Loretta's Burger comes with prime beef, provolone cheese, bacon, caramelized onions and garlic aioli spread on a brioche bun. The burger was decent, but nothing special. I was most excited to try the Mini Parrillada and that turned out to be the biggest letdown. It had no flavor at all and I honestly felt like vomiting after trying some of the things on the plate. The complimentary bread was good! It was great to munch on while waiting for the entrées.",

The ambiance inside was nice, super cozy with a cute wine wall. Our server was very sweet and had great recommendations. I tried the risotto de carne which was wonderful, warm and delicious. My boyfriend had the pollo al grill which he really enjoyed as well. His plate came with complimentary mashed potatoes and we ordered the mixed veggies as an extra side. The zucchini was grilled & super yummy. Hope to try the parrilla next time",
      "I was really excited to try Loretta & The Butcher with my friends for a girls brunch.The Provoletta was a good appetizer although it arrived with the main dishes. I ordered a chorizo sandwich and a prosciutto sandwich. Both were really tasty and fresh! My friends loved their Milanese plates.Overall, the food was delicious and was very filling! The service was a bit slow and we struggled to find our waiter most of the time there. In addition, once we left we checked the receipt and realized they charged us incorrectly for 2 plates we ordered as they were on the brunch menu but were charged as regular price (our fault for not checking earlier). They also did not have any brunch drinks other than beer/wine which is fine but just a heads up.",
      "Honestly I was very excited to go here with my friends and try out a new place. We heard there was a happy hour but then realized it was only for beer and wine which was a little dissapointing.I ordered 2 sandwiches which tasted fine but nothing out of this world. Our food didn't take too long to come out but we ordered something to go and were left waiting with no one to come check on us for at least 40 minutes. In my opinion, the food was not worth the price and although the staff was nice, it felt as if they forgot about us.I don't think this place is worth going to if you're in the grove.",
      "Best churrasco in the miami area. Service is friendly and fast and the food was excellenttry the ceaser salad and the mollejas appetizers. we brought our own wine and they didnt charge us corkage fee.",
      "The meal was excellent!  I cannot remember a better prepared steak than I had tonight.  The staff was very attentive and pleasant.  We ate outside and the music and ambiance were perfect.  I would eat here every night if I could.",
      "I can't say this place truly impressed me. It was just ok. The cauliflower was a tad bland and we had to ask for salt to liven it up a bit. I think if it was actually served cut up instead of a huge slab, the flavoring from roasting would get through the entire thing. The pulpo (octopus) was actually good. It had a nice vinegrette dressing on it and the octopus tasted fresh. The linguine was just ok. Again, felt it was a bit bland. It looked gorgeous though.I don't know if I would stop by here again. If my friends absolutely wanted to go, then sure, I'd go, but I wouldn't go out of my way to make a special trip here."

      "Quaint & Cute place to have a delicious breakfast. The interior is lively with a cute patio for seating. All of the entrees were full of flavor! The pancakes had a beautiful presentation with edible flowers. Out of all the croissants we tried, the charcoal & caramel croissant was my absolute favorite. Stuffed with a creamy caramel sauce and a soft & flakey croissant, it was absolutely delicious. Highly recommend for an upscale brunch spot.",
      "Came here for brunch with a friend at noon. We were seated quickly and ordered drinks and food. The drinks were ok, they were a bit watered down. My friend said her salmon burger was the best she's ever had and my guava pancakes with the cream cheese mousse was beyond phenomenal and presented wonderfully. I'd recommend sharing the pancakes or taking it home because the portion is huge.",
      "(Traduit par Google) Très bonne nourriture. Aux prix, vous vous attendez à un style légèrement plus grand(Avis d'origine)Très bonne nourriture. Pour les prix, vous devez vous attendre à des portions légèrement plus grandes",
      "Popped and sat on the lovely outdoor deck. TRUFFLE BUN (top left) - 4.5/5. An upscale bacon egg and cheese. Hey, it works. CROISSANT LOAF FRENCH TOAST (bottom) - 5/5. Crumble provides great texture. Raspberry gel and vanilla cream can be combined to form a wonderful sauce. French toast itself solid and good canvas for everything else to shine.REINA PEPIADA (top right) - 3/5. Excited to try something new but didn't work for me. The core of arepa, cheddar, avocado chicken mix, fried egg and cojita cheese should have been delicious but just didn't pop. The wasakaka sauce is intensely cilantro as expected, but not my personal favorite.",
      "We landed at MIA around 7am and this seemed to be one of the first places to open up and have good ratings. Lyft ride to the restaurant was in the midst of rush hour traffic but it was worth the ride.Food was good. Reina pepida was tasty and had a fresh taste of lime juice. Spicy tuna had an abundance of avocado mash on top, cucumber slices and mushrooms. It came with a side of greens. I am glad we deviated from our usual of eggs Benedict and scrambled egg brunch items.Will definitely come back when passing through MIA.",
      "Wow so good. This is a \"must-get\" every time I visit Miami. Brunch can get very busy but I've never waited longer than 30min for a table! The service is very efficient and the food comes out fast!I've tried a few things on the menu and everything I've tried so far was great. I honestly think you cannot go wrong with ordering anything on the menu. This kitchen really knows their flavors!Our server recommended the steak and eggs which were fantastic. The steak wasn't a normal American \"steak\" but was more like a braised short rib which paired excellently with the eggs. More recently, I ordered the Reina Pepeida and the arepa was sooooo good. It is a great \"lighter\" option if you are not a big eater. My friend always gets the Chilaquiles which she swears is the best on the menu.Can't wait to be back the next time I'm in Miami :)",
      "Wow!!! Found this place looking for somewhere to have brunch w/my sister & Taylor who were visiting from out of town. Fast & friendly service and the food came out so fast even though they were busy. Every single plate looked incredible... like Instagramable!!!  BUT THE TASTE WAS EVEN BETTER!! I had the steak & eggs... my sister had pancakes & Taylor had French toast!  Huge portions... great price...  And it's a super cute spot!!! I'll definitely go again.. 10/10 recommend!!!",
      "This place is WONDERFUL! The food was unique, flavorful, and had beautiful presentation. We really enjoyed the French toast and Chiliquilies. The cost is Miami brunch expensive (as expected) but the food really delivers and is worth the cost. It's in a great location (walking distance from the Brickell mall) and outdoor seating is beautiful. Service is great as well. Overall highly recommend for brunch.",
      "This quaint little joint packs a big punch for brunch! I sat outside to enjoy the weather and to take in the sounds. I order the French toast and wow! Brunch...dessert...whatever! It was a great dish. Definitely a different spin on a classic dish. Be adventurous and give it a shot!"

      "Staying close by so stopped here for a late lunch, 2:40om. Excited about the concept (local, seasonally food) , the previous glowing reviews, and the ability to either select from the menu or creat your own. Tried to call to confirm they were open on Christmas Eve but the call kept dropping. That should have been my first clue.Absolutely no customers. Sure it's Christmas Eve but the other restaurants next door and across the courtyard had lots of customers. No employees in sight. When one appeared I asked if they were open. Got a \"Yes, we're open.\" But no other acknowledgement. No, how can I help you or welcome to the Naked Farmer. Even McDonalds greets you when you enter,Dismayed to discover that all the food everything from the entrees to sides including the cookies are premade. As in already cooked who knows how long ago. And sitting out in the open on a heating element under a heat lamp. It's like an expensive buffet. Or an airline lounge but you're paying for the food. Food is not inexpensive here. Prices are actually very high for what you get and the amount. Yes, it's Coral Gables. I saw the prices online and was quite willing to pay those rates on the assumption the food was cooked to order. But it is not. I considered not ordering and decided against it. I have sn early flight tomorrow and although they'll feed me on the plane, it's always good to have backup food. The food isn't hot or fresh now so probably won't taste much different tomorrow. I got the rosemary chicken breast, green beans, and charred broccoli. Three items for $16.18. Yikes! Tried the food before I put it in the fridge for the morning. As I thought, it was cold, almost room temperature. The broccoli and chicken were bland and tasteless. No hint, flavor or otherwise evidence of rosemary in the rosemary chicken. But the green beans were tasty if only they were hot (temperature).Would I come back again? As mentioned I LOVE the concept but not the execution. If the food were prepared fresh to order then I'd come back. As it is, no.",

It's quick service similar to Chipotle. The interior is gorgeous with beautiful green tile detail. The Fall Harvest Bowl was really tasty. It cost me $20 which I feel is a bit pricey for a bowl but is pretty common these days especially in Coral Gables. I would recommend but don't expect it to be a cheap lunch!",

The chicken was perfectly fried with a sweet taste to it! Such a great combo with the waffle! Definitely on my top five for best chicken and waffles. * Edgewater Sandwich This was such a good sandwich! It was so savory! This chicken sandwich had a coleslaw mix in it with a yummy sweet soy. This is a must try on the menu! We will definitely be coming back soon! Hope you enjoy!",
      "Hi Yazmine! Thank you so much for your kind review. It means so much to new, small businesses like us. We’d love to have you back!",
      "The K-Poppin is popping! They fry their chicken to perfection! I enjoy the sandwiches. I had family in town and they tried the medium wings with two sauces. The BBQ was good but the sweet and sour just tasted sweet, no sour. I love the potato dippers. You can't go wrong with those at all. Definitely worth a try if you are in the area.",
      "Great fried chicken sandwich. My friend and I didn't realize it was take out only, but it still worked out. The location is interesting... you can order ahead, or via the kiosk inside. The wait wasn't too long, but it seems like a popular restaurant. Next time we will definitely order ahead.",

      "After being highly disappointed with another chicken place at the eatery decided to give this place a try. The staff was super friendly and helpful making me feel at ease, answering any questions I had about the menu. Shout out to Ray! The chicken is not frozen- fresh! Even when I got home the wings were hot & fresh. You can tell that they make their food with love. Got the garlic butter and something with chili oil..both were delicious. The curly fries were crispy. We also got the potato dippers which are like curved French fries for you to scoop sauce with. All the sauces were fresh including the ranch and blue cheese. They also have chicken sandwiches, chicken nuggets, and varieties of shrimp. Don't sleep on this place",
      "Thank you for the kind review! We definitely appreciate your business and look forward seeing you again!",
      "Ordered the Wynwood. It was everything I wanted. Very crispy coating to the chicken and the chicken is well seasoned. The coleslaw and spicy mayo are the perfect combo for this sandwich. Also, to make it a double it's only $5. They don't skimp on the chicken breast, it's a huge piece of bird. Lol. A few improvements I suggest is simply maybe offering a no bun option for those on keto, offer the coleslaw as a side and to use sea salt. That is all. Oh maybe add Belgian waffles. Thanks for the yummy food.",
      "Thank you for the review! We’re actually going to be offering new options soon for wraps as well as no bun. We appreciate the feedback and love that you love our food as well.",
      "Doesn't deserve one star... this location houses many restaurants, Applebees, Panera bread etc  (I suppose with one kitchen?) . Was looking for Korean fried chicken.... from kpoppin . The taste seemed nothing like Korean but was very familiar to me.  What it seemed like was maybe Applebees or Chili's barbecue flavor probably?  Never again.",

      "My hubby and I are always looking for new spots to grab a bite to eat. We wandered upon K-Poppin  at the Wynwood Eatery and so glad we did. We had the Korean 10 piece chicken nuggets and the potato dippers. The chicken nuggets were so fresh, made of all chicken breast. They were moist and flavorful and there was an array of sauces we tried them with. The ranch and Korean bbq sauces were amazing and were also made from scratch. I can't say enough good things about K-Poppin. Would highly recommend to anybody looking for a delicious, freshly made bite to eat, We can't wait to go back again and try the other items. Chef Ray is in a league of his own.",
      "I'm what one would call a chicken nugget connoisseur. K-Poppin makes the best chicken nuggets I've ever had in my entire life.  The Korean BBQ bites of heaven arrived fresh and hot with a zesty sauce with the perfect amount of kick. I rarely leave reviews but this one is 100% worthy of one. Highest praises to the chef. Yum. Yum. Yum."

We opted to snack on croquettes and angry patatas. A full meal wasn't in the cards due to being exhausted from travel.As much as I have wandered Brickell while living in MIA, I assumed Delores was only the street level bar. Who knew the building had historic charm and an obscure the path to the rooftop bar.A repeat customer on my future MIA adventure.",
      "Really cool restaurant. The decor to the food presentation was amazing! We started off with corn bread. It was good. They had 2 types of water to choose from. We did the entrees. I got the filet mignon milanese with mash potatoes. It was so good. My brother and sister got ribs. It was so cool. They had a smoke that they added when they placed the food. With our entrees we got a free tapa. We chose ceaser salad (was cool, the shaked it up in a jar), croquettes (so good), tostones & bruschetta.",
      "Came for happy hour on a Friday which was from 4-7pm. Had reservations for 6 with a request to be on the rooftop, which they honored. Views were nice and they are kid friendly. Everything kind of went downhill from there. Service was extremely poor/slow. We managed to get two drinks each in a two hour span. Most drinks were served with no garnish whatsoever, so 0 for presentation. Tapas were 2 for 22$. Angry potatoes are an extremely small portion for the price. No one ever came and checked on us throughout. Also, a strange woman with a professional camera came around trying to sell photos for 21$ a piece. At first, I thought she was taking pictures of our group for website or Instagram. She never mentioned she was selling until she returned with multiples photos in picture frames. I thought this drastically brought the value down at this place as it seems trashy and cheap. We literally left this restaurant to eat elsewhere as we were so turned off.",
      "Mediocre food and drinks. First round of drinks had garnishes and second round was sloppy and no garnish. Only good thing about this place is the rooftop views.90% of the waiters at this restaurant are old enough to be my grandfather. So expect slow service, no hard feelings to them but just strange. Super weird they have a photographer taking photos in the restaurant and we thought it was just for social media. NOPE this women prints and frames the photos and sells them for $20 each. Super cheesy and weird for a restaurant.",
      "As soon as we walked into the beautiful patio, I knew we were in for a treat. The atmosphere is incredible, with nice soft lighting, a good breeze, tasteful decor, and they provided us with blankets because it was slightly chilly outside. The service was equally incredible, I felt like Chris really took care of us!My favorite thing was by far the tostones with strawberry salsa, they were somehow not super fried and the strawberry topping was amazing. The cornbread was also super tasty, no wonder everyone gets it here. Not going to lie, the portions were quite large so we weren't too hungry when our entrees arrived, but the tuna was very delicious- it had this interesting sauce and a pepper crust. The short rib papardelle we're also very flavorful. For dessert, we got this really interesting thing called message in a bottle, which is this great chocolate wafer cake with various toppings you can put on it. But the best part was that you can write a little message about your time here or your life in general, and that was very fun to come up with. There was one weird thing- a photographer came around and took our photo and then came back asking which of the shots we were buying, which kinda felt pushy, but aside from what, it's a wonderful date spot!",
      "They had upstairs seating which was really nice. The service was great but I must say the flavor of the steak with chimichurri wasn't the best. I've had better in Detroit at a Cuban spot, which is crazy because I would had thought it would be better in Miami.They don't have GF symbols anywhere on their menu which was annoying. My friends also didn't rave about their plates even though it looked really good. It was very pricy for the quality and flavor but we still had a good time for the view and atmosphere. Even got a cute pic of the group from a third party photographer that came to our table and took our picture. Now I have something to remember the night. I think she charged $30 or $25.",
      "Me and my friend came here to celebrate her birthday. She recommended it to me. The ambiance of this restaurant is just amazing!! The food is good but I am not blown away. Not a lot of options for vegetarians. Loved the gazpacho, they even gave me the recipe for it. The roasted peppers appetizer was yummy. The fried plantain bruschetta was good but the fried plantain was quite heavy. The cheesecake was so dense, not of my taste.The service is great as well.Overall I would recommend this place.",
      "Loved this place! Went on a Monday night and it was still pretty busy. The host was welcoming, even the tall lady that sat us at our table. So nice and welcoming as we approached the top of the rooftop! I love that welcoming energy because I'm always super excited when visiting new spots!  The menu deal was order an entree and receive an appetizer for free. I order the salmon which came with a sweet glaze and rice on the side. For appetizer, I ordered the lobster quesadilla. I really enjoyed everything about my meal. My partner order the oxtail tacos and short rib pasta . He said it was good as well. We also ordered cornbread for the table. EVERYTHING I MEAN EVERYTHING WAS YUMMY! My drink was a Lychee Martini. Only reason I gave it 4 stars is because, a 4 top table sat after us, but they received their food and drinks first. We waited a little while to get our food, but our service received by Martin was TOP TIER & when we did receive our food it was sooooo good!  Martin gave us great recommendations & was very attentive. He told us the history of the restaurant, that it use to be a fire station. Knowing the history added to the whole experience.  I'm definitely coming back here again, I want to try their brunch. I highly recommend this place!",

The history behind the restaurant was fascinating which our waiter Carlos was very knowledgeable in making the experience fun! The service was 5/5. Definitely make a reservation. The music was too loud causing people around you speak louder. The food was delicious. The free app deal is well worth. The steak was very well seasoned and cooked. The Ham croquettes are a must order! Crispy and soft w potatoes in the inside. The lobster bisque comes separately and they pour it in front of you to stay warm! Taste was amazing but more you eat more greasy feeling you get. The seafood paella was alright, don't remember much. Best sangria I've ever had. Taco app was amazing as well. THE WORLDS BEST CHOCOLATE CAKE..11/10 !!"

The sandwich and pizza were awesome too. Will come back again!",

This location is their first with another planned for another S Florida location. Service was also very fastThis is def one of those places that can go on repeat.  It's located in this nice walkable, courtyard like area with outdoor seating.  Makes for a great night out experience to enjoy the outdoors, weather permitting.

We all ordered lemonades. The mint ginger one was a bit too sour/bitter but the others were great. We ordered the goat cheese croquetas as an appetizer (they serve 6 and were very good) which came out pretty quickly. For our entrees we ordered the Margharita pizza (very good), the Fugazetta pizza (pizza was good but the beet aioli cream they serve it with was better!), the Potato Rosti (very good) and the falafel sandwich (good). Service was excellent, everything came out very quickly, and the restaurant is spacious and clean."

      "1 enero 2023, servicio lento, pedimos un daiquiri y nos sirvieron limonada con ron y,hielo , pedimos una picaderos para acompañar y los tostones fríos y crudos , no lo recomiendo al menos en días festivos , tuvimos que esperar porque las mesas estaban sucias y nadie disponible",
      "I'm not going to give you a in depth review of El Cristo Restaurant based on my limited time there and small samples of food and beverage.  We were on a weekend trip to Miami and wanted to visit Little Havana.  As soon as we arrived in Little Havana at 9:00a we wanted to try a Cuban Coffee for the 1st time.  I had seen the great reviews of El Cristo elsewhere on the inter web and had our Uber driver drop is there. Andrew greeted us on the street and seated us outside at a table on the sidewalk.  Overall his service was A++.  Very attentive, nice guy and able to hold a conversation. He got us a couple Cuban Coffee's with sugar and 2 beef empanada's. Yeah,  strange breakfast,  but it worked. Cuban Coffee was strong and sweet with a little layer of foam.  Reminded me of an Expresso,  but not as bitter.  I loved it.  The empanada's had a nice flakey crust and a savory ground beef inside. Highly recommend.",
      "Ordered the mahi mahi and the lobster. The Mahi mahi was dry and tastless. The lobster looked prefrozen and was overcooked.  The worst thjng was they charged us 75 for it. Ok, it did say MP for the lobster but we should have been warned  that the lobster was for $75, when everything else was between 12-25.Also had the sangria which came with  canned fruit salad! If i could give a 0 star i would. A tourist trap. Beware!",
      "So we returned to Little Havana to grab some lunch.  This wasn't our first choice, but the first choice was closed they day we were in the neighborhood.  Cuban food.The server said \"everything is good\" when asked about the menu, which isn't very helpful.  Not everything was explicitly Cuban, but he claimed it was \"Cuban style\".  Also not very helpful.  I ended up ordering the Bandeja El Cristo, and my wife ordered the Solomillo.Both were fine, but a little disappointing.  The Solomillo was what appeared to be a stir-fry with a pile of rice/beans and a few slices of plantains.  The flavor of the rice/beans was actually very nice.  The \"stir-fry\" was nothing special.Meanwhile, my bandeja was a mixed bag.  The tamale was almost all masa; very little filling.  The rice was rice, the beans were black beans.  Very basic, no seasoning.  Then there were two cups with meat.  Those were pretty good.  I ended up mixing the rice and beans (which still wasn't as good as the rice/beans mix my wife was served), and the one meat with the tamale to make up for the fact there was almost no filling.The mango smoothie was all smoothie (i.e. creamy), and very little mango.  My lemonade was better.All in all, a mixed bag of \"pretty good\" and \"mediocre\".  And a bit pricey.",
      "This was actually our SECOND choice of Cuban restaurants to go to, but the first had live music which was so loud that it made conversation IMPOSSIBLE. And am I glad that we did go to this one. Server was on point, and even tried to help with out of the usual requests by my dining companion. Food was truly quite good, with nice presentation as well. As a side note, it appears most of the restaurants charge an 18% gratuity already. Some will let you know it's a gratuity, while others will claim it's a service charge and not the tip. This place was one of the former, and not the later. So look at your bill closely.",
      "Looking to take a load off after walking around Little Havana we stopped into El Cristo for some lunch.  It was a must to have Cuban food and the menu looked good.  We were a group of five, three of our group ordered full meals and my hubs and I ordered sandwiches.  I mean, I had to have a Cubano Sandwich at least once on this trip done right and El Cristo did not disappoint.  The server recommend the Pan Con Lechon sandwich to my husband, saying it was better than the Cubano in his opinion and he did really like it a lot.   The sandwiches do come with these potato sticks that are like tiny fries, so you really do not need to order fries -- although we did order a side of fries not knowing.  Oddly they came out cold, a few were actually still frozen!  They immediately took them back and made it right.  Everyone enjoyed their meal, the prices were reasonable in my opinion all things considered in today's inflated economy.  Our service was good and so was the food!",
      "Ok my friends. Found another gem in little Havana. This is a cool little spot with a mighty flavorful punch.  The service is excellent and the food is amazing.  Ambiance is very lively and full of life.  We ordered drinks and lunch. A fresh lemonade a coquette and a mojito.Baby Churrasco, Pan Con Bistek (steak Sandwich with a Cuban flare)  Cubano El Cristo and some Morros rice.  Those Cubano sandwiches either the steak or the El Cristo were excellent.  Made with the famous Cuban bread. So perfectly layers with sausage ham and pork and cheese. The baby churrasco was so tender and flavorful served with the Cuban morro rice and fried plantains. Great service came with amazing food. Very attentive.  Made sure we were like family.  A great place to eat. Enjoy.",
      "Food is good but service doesn't exist. No water refills, unfriendly waitress, had to keep asking for bill, and must pay 14% gratuity on party of 4 for NO SERVICE.The customer sitting next to us gave me a smile when I came in. My assumption of his sarcastic smile was wrong, as I noticed he seemed to be unhappy with their service as well.And to put this in clear context, the business wasn't even busy.",
      "This place is overpriced and not good at all. I had the rib eye steak and eggs and my steak was more like an old piece of meat, dry and skimpy for 29.99. I had 3 small coffee americano and they were 5 dollars each. Not good",
      "Absolutely delicious spot in Little Havana. The service is incredible and the food is perfection! We went back 2 times while visiting. They have many shareable options which was perfect for my large group."

      "We got the butchers's feast for 4 people. The waiter will tell you it's not enough, but in reality it's more than enough food.This included 4 types of meats, all incredibly high quality and fresh. On top of that, there's unlimited side dishes and soufflé egg and rice. 100% worth it!",
      "After years of wanting to try out Cote I decided to take myself on a date as my first sit down meal of 2023! Located in design district, it is somewhat of a high end korean Bbq spot with loads of meat options as well as seafood and korean side dishes. We had reservations and were sat down right away. They quickly took our drink order and I decided to try \"The heat\" since I'm a slut for spicy margaritas. I maybe should've gone out of my comfort zone. It was delicious but nothing out of this world for $20+ a drink. The margarita was small, full of ice and not strong at all but delicious non the less. We ordered the butchers feast, no need to even look at the menu. We wondered what people get here if it's not the feast. You get to try an array of different sides and meats cooked tableside for an amazing price of $68. While I enjoyed the meats, the portions were really small. Thought it is a lot of courses, it was only 7oz of meat per person. They do cook it tableside to your liking and explain really well what everything is and how to eat it with your designated sides. I wish they would've brought out all the sides at once but they brought out half the sides when we were halfway through the meat. My favorite was the short ribs. The marinade was sweet but the meat was so tender compared to other k-bbq spots with short rib. It melted in your mouth! I put them in a lettuce wrap with the sauce and fermented veggies and rolled my head back to take it all in. The American Wagyu was also melt in your mouth soft! We also tried the wagyu paella which I would recommend skipping. It wasn't special, meat was over cooked in the paella and it was $40. I rather eat another portion of white rice with the insane kimchi soup they serve as a side, poured over it. The service was super attentive. We always had water and while we had multiple waiters, it seemed like they all cared about the experience and worked together to make this an incredible restaurant. It's a must come for the experience and it felt like the vibes made it for a perfect date night! I would typically prefer AYCE bbq for a less price but this was a perfect choice for when you wanna dress up and have a unique experience. Hope to come again and try their seafood soon!",
      "Really date-night type swanky place in the Design District.Food here is 5/5 - we went for the tasting set menu, where you get 4 different cuts of beef. In addition, you get unlimited \"ban chan\", the traditional Korean appetisers, as well as some pretty hefty other main dishes, and a soft serve ice cream at the end. We left very full from the meal!Ambiance is also 5/5. Nice and dim for dinner, and not loud at all. Really cool having the meats and veg grilled right at your table.Why is this only a 4 star review? Well, the front desk trio of women were extremely obnoxious and clueless when we arrived. We asked how long we had the table for - one woman quickly said \"1 hour\", before realising her mistake, and trying to correct by saying 1.5 hours. Wow, that's still wrong. It takes at least 2 hours to get through the set menu. No apologies from the three women. They seem clueless about their jobs, just there as eye candy?",
      "My first official Michelin Star restaurant. Came for Miami Spice lunch with my sisters to check it out bc we love Korean BBQ. The ambience was elegant and nice. I'm sure it's probably more romantic at night, but for lunch it was a nice vibe and pretty busy. The service is good as the waiters cook the food for you and are very friendly. We ordered off the regular menu as well as the butcher's feast from the spice menu and  all the meats were delicious. The bimpap was ok, because I love it when the rice is crunchy on the outside and this one wasn't. The steak tartare was amazing and flavorful. The egg soufflé was really good as well. The pork belly was so good and filling along with all the other sides. One thing that I surprisingly liked was the okra. It was my fist time trying it and I enjoyed it.  To top of the afternoon we were all treated with the perfect end to our meal, the caramel ice cream! I would definitely come back for a special occasion and recommend anyone who likes good meats, service and good food in general to try it out. It is a bit pricey, but worth it for the quality.",
      "If you're looking for authentic Korean bbq, this isn't the place for you. I'd give all of the meat qualities 5 stars but I expected more from a Michelin star restaurant. From the butchers feast menu, the American wagyu was my favorite cut. After I was seated, I was greeted at my table by 3 different servers. Not sure if there's a different server for drinks, service, and meat but I felt a little rushed as they all came to check in on what I'd be ordering right after one another. They also ask if you want sparking or still water. They did not give me a choice for regular/free water. After my selection of meats came out for the butchers feast, the server explains the different cuts then walked away. I almost started grilling the meats my self because there was no explanation that another server would be grilling for you.  The scallion mix is really good as you can definitely taste the Korean red pepper paste in it. The kimchee stew was a bit watered down and bland. I was also told to eat the rice cake dipped in the dwenjang sauce which is not how it's really eaten by Koreans. The egg soufflé looked appetizing but it was quite salty and drier than what I'm used to. The soy sauce caramel soft serve was really good at the end, but you can't really go wrong with ice cream. Overall, the food was good but I expected more.",
      "COTE needs no introduction. If you are coming here, then you probably know the scoop. Butcher's Feast with A5 tenderloin supplement is my go to every time. Super great value and you get a taste of selected cuts with Korean sides:Ban ChanScallion SaladRed Leaf Lettuce with Ssam-jangSavory Egg SouffléTwo Stews with Rice And the best part - soy caramel soft serve. Seconds are a must!! I wish the sauce was bottled. I could have it every day!!Service is always on point and we love that the staff does all the cooking. To me this is a truly fantastic KBBQ experience. Run, don't walk! :)",
      "We ordered butcher's feast, galbi, cold noodle, bibibamp and some drink. I love my finesse - cute and not alcoholic. Price and quantity are quite reasonable compared to other Michelin restaurants. Most meat dishes are enjoyable except the extra galbi we ordered - it was cut into a very nice shape but too fat. Angus and American wagyu are juicy and tasty. It's true that high quality Ingredients  don't require a lot of seasoning to show their natural taste. The sides are delicious, especially the egg bowl (sorry not sure its name but it came in with the butcher's feast combo). We also ordered a mushroom dish it's amazing. The only dishes we didn't enjoy were the two soups in the Butcher's feast combo - the one with tofu and the other one with kimchi - both were too salty. The cold noodle was just spicy & bibibamp is OK. Service is great (of course). :) We felt welcomed the second we stepped in. Some parking tips: it's a pain to park in design district but here are two ways: there's valet service on 39th St or park on museum public parking if you prefer a short walk after meal.",
      "To start I don't think I've had food this good in a really long time. The service was incredible. We had the Butchers Feast. We could barely get through the last serving of this menu it was so much food. At first we were a little intimidated by the sides but we trusted the server and boy were we glad we did. The Butchers Feast comes with four different cuts of beef all amazing but the Wagyu!!!!!!! It was beyond amazing. My friend and I are still talking about it. We cannot wait to go back.I would give this place 10 stars if I could!",
      "The meat was awesome, of course. They were cooked perfectly by the server. But we felt rushed by the server. He started cooking the next piece immediately after the previous was done. We didn't have time to taste and enjoy the meat with wine. We still have more than half of the wine left after the table was all cleaned up. I have visited quite some starred restaurants, this is the only one not enjoyable.",
      "Do you want an experience?? Cote Korean BBQ/ Michelin Star,MiamiIf you haven't... you should!The Butchers Feast, 4 different types of beef and accompaniments plus desert included. Prices right!! $68-pp.Staff so knowledgeable!Food presented beautifully and cooked to perfection on the grill in the center of the table.No rush , just sit back and relax! Afterwards take a nice stroll where all top designers have stand alone shops.Fun to window shop and people watch in the Design district!"

      "We loved this beach bar at the Kimpton hotel, in between the pool and the beach. There were plenty of tables with shade, and we enjoyed a delicious burger and amazing fish tacos. Our server was super friendly and helpful. This is a great place for a drink and a bite anytime. Definitely recommended.",
      "Great outside beach bar and lounge. Good drinks and yucca fries. My only complaint is that they should be transparent about the small drink vs. the large drink costs for happy hour and the 20% gratuity automatically added to the charge.",
      "Tina was awesome! She took care of all our needs and was super pleasant...we will definitely be coming back to enjoy another stay! Thank you Tina!",
      "During my South Beach staycation I searched for fish tacos near me, and WOW this place did not disappoint! I got fish tacos, bae got shrimp tacos, both were fresh and delicious. Yucca fries are bomb af with great dipping sauce you want to smother on everything. Frosé was cute to see on menu and got me tipsy. I'll def be back Covid safe: our table was under the sun far from other tables",
      "High Tide is the outside bar & grill at the Kimpton Surfcomber hotel.  It's located behind the pool and is accessible by the walkway to the beach.High Tide has a full bar and tables to dine.  You don't have to be a hotel guest to visit High Tide.  They have servers that take care of the hotel guests by the pool.During our stay at the Kimpton, we dined outside by the bar as well as ordered from the servers as we did nothing by the pool all day.  The High Tide staff did well through it all.I ordered their Cheeseburger for a late breakfast one day.  It was tasty, fresh and they were generous with the cheese.  Salads ordered as well and the veggies were all crisp.  All was well.We ordered their Vodka berry cocktail. ( I forgot the name) Our server suggested just making it a pitcher for better value and he was absolutely correct!  Game recognized game as he knew we were drinking by the pool all day.  He checked on us frequently and kept our waters and napkins fresh throughout the day.High Tide is another great reason we'd consider staying at the Kimpton Surfcomber again.  They have a solid kitchen and the staff was friendly, professional and on point.  Cheers!",

I also ordered a side of plantains. The food was amazing and complimented one another. The coquito shots were tasty. Our server was Frank and he was very patient and attentive.",

At the end of our meal he complimented us with shots of coquito (very delicious) also right before we left he brought another round out! Extremely generous! The hospitality was felt by me and my family, a great great experience! I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who is looking for classic mofongo or mofongo with a twist! Honestly a 10/10! From the vibes to the food, come please your soul with this restaurant!Come catch these vibes frrPeace & Love!",
      "I came to Miami to visit my parents; my cousin lives close to this restaurant, so she recommended it since my husband is Puerto Rican that way, we could all try it. We usually go to Mofongos at Bayside, but we wanted to try this since it was closer. The presentation of the dishes was excellent, and that was about it. Overpriced, flavors not there; very disappointed. They had an event and the live instruments playing were so absurdly annoying my husband, who has tinnitus, had to step out of the restaurant. It was nice but just lasted way too long, not suitable for such a small space. In conclusion, cool to go one and experience the atmosphere, but we won't be returning.",
      "My out-of-the-town friend wanted to try this place and I love mofongo, so we're more than happy to give it a try.  Going in it was great vibe, colorfully painted walls, waitstaff in tropical attire, the place looked fun, happy and happening.My friend, being the tourist, opted for the pina colada in a pineapple, but was underwhelmed with the taste.  As a tourist, she also wanted the huge, IG-able kan-kan pork chop, which is basically a fried pork chop with the belly chicharron attached and arching like a rainbow on the plate. We pretty much spent the money for a photo op.  The pork chop was so dry and tough. The chicharron was no better.  We usually love the crunchy skin, but this was so hard that they may break your teeth.  The mofongo was a dry, dense, tasteless puck. The shrimp in our other mofongo could have been fresher.  Our waitress was also rather pushy, and impatient with us as my friend, trying Puerto Rican food for the first time, had a few questions about the menu. We left half the food uneaten, and I feel sorry for the tourists who came here for their first taste of mofongo. Puerto Rican food could be so much more delicious than what this place offers.",
      "If you're visiting Little Havana, Mofongo is not to be missed. The restaurant is highly rated as it is, but after checking it out for myself, now I know why. First, the service is pretty good. Our server was attentive, fun, and really took care of us without being overbearing. The atmosphere inside is lively - Latin music is playing, some of the servers are singing along and really appear to be enjoying themselves. The menu has a lot to offer and I really liked that you can customize your Mofongo options to include green plantain, ripe plantain, or even yuca - as well as a variety of sauces. Be warned that the Mofongo is huge! It comes out as a towering pile, almost bigger than your head. Probably enough for two people to share honestly. Our server brought out some hot chicken broth for us to pour over the Mofongo to soften it up, and a pink sauce for dipping. Everything was super flavorful! The shrimp was large and juicy. The carne frita was smoky and moist too. If I had a bottomless stomach I would have kept eating and eating it. Luckily, the Mofongo is already packed in a plastic container inside of the vessel it comes in, so it's easy to pop a lid on and take it to go. The meal is also finished off with two little shots of coquito, to our surprise. And all this was at lunch time on a Monday! I would absolutely go back next time I'm in Miami.",
      "This was my first time ever having Mofongo and it was a wonderful experience. Our server was so nice and attentive. Everything I ordered was delicious and flavorful. The restaurant isn't huge but it isn't small. There's plenty of street parking along the blvd and also a parking lot near by. I will be returning in the future!",
      "Outstanding!!!  The only downside is trying to find parking in Little Havana (& pricey at that).Food was just amazing!  Started off with the fried cheese with guava.   Not what I was expecting and just excellent!  Next up I ordered the chicken breast mofongo.  I could only eat half as the portion is a decent size but very filling.  BFF had the combination plate (fried pork (chicharrons), pastele, and arroz con gandules).  Lastly, dessert was flan de coco(nut).  BFF also had \"cafe con leche\" as an after meal coffee.  Service was excellent and the servers were so genuinely friendly, attentive, and helpful.  If there was a \"con\" it would be that prices are a tad bit expensive but this place is also in a tourist trap.",
      "I was so excited to see a video Puerto Rican food van advertising mofongo on Calle ocho that I spontaneously walked in the drizzling rain to this spot that I had a good feeling about. I saw on the way there they are expanding to an additional location a few doors down and I knew I was in for a treat. As a boricua who grew up with the most authentic home cooked meals, Mofongos absolutely exceeded my expectations. Welcomed by a pleasant greeter I sat alone at the bar and was served by the kindest bartender. I was not feeling the best and sought my go to comfort foods, both of which were on the menu and reasonably priced I got Sancocho and a side of arroz con gandules. It was exactly what I wanted, needed, and tasted like home. I couldn't have been any happier with the flavor or quality of the food, even the presentation in a mini caldera was so appeasing to my nostalgia. My stovetop doesn't take those pots so I really appreciated the detail. Very happy with my experience",
      "Our server Cassandra was phenomenal! She was attentive to our needs and her recommendations were exactly what we were craving. We ordered the Mofongo with the carne Ahumada and the Monfongo with fired pork. **Note: don't forget to ask for some chicken broth on the side. When you drizzle some of the juices on the mofongo itself. It is an explosion of flavors!!** Absolutely delicious. We paired the food with a mango mojito and a Heineken. To top of our meal we shared the fried cheese with guava. 10 out of 10! Thank you for the experience.",
      "We had never had Puerto Rican food before, so we thought we would try it out. Our waiter, the best. He wrote all of our names down and remembered them the entire time we were there. We came in because we saw they had drinks in pineapples. (We are basic, we know.) we tried both of the appetizer platters on the menu and we were not disappointed at all. This is a must go and see kinda place."

      "What an amazing spot, we absolutely LOVED it. It's fairly young and trendy, so I would not take my baby boomer parents here (or a baby in general)- but for a younger, fun, lively crowd, this is perfect. The inside is really cool - lots of artwork, somewhat hidden restaurant, similar to a speakeasy. The drinks were unique and incredible and the food was OUTSTANDING! Very gastronomic - if you're into that sort of thing (my parents wouldn't get it). We basically ordered the entire menu, until we nearly exploded. Here were a few memorable plates (as in, those I can remember after imbibing for a few hours)...Spanglish milk bread - the black salt on top. WOW. They say, once you go black (salt), you never go back right? Exactly. The guava butter was unlike any butter I have ever had. It's very tropical, and fruity! Wagyu beef ravioli - that blue cheese sauce was to die for - take some of that milk bread and drunk your bread in this sauce to your heart's desire (and worry about the consequences later, because bread and cheese, whew!) Nitro Watermelon Tataki - the only remotely healthy thing that entered our mouths at dinner. It's such a cool fish - watermelon, pomegranate seeds, toasted pumpkin seeds, olive oil and a total flavor overload. Not to mention the fact that the fish came out looking like sashimi grade tuna. So cool. Arroz Mamposteado - this was a cool fish. It was rice and beans, but mixed with avocado creme and and pork belly and chips. Incredible. I'm not much of a dessert but holy smokes did we devour the suspiro. I'm quite positive I licked the jar towards the end of the evening - don't judge me. I wish I could remember what cocktail I had, but the choices are all so unique and fun, I should have tried them all. Eh, gives me a reason to go back, right?!",
      "Thank you so much for the kind words and the detailed review of all of our dishes, Shannon.  It was a pleasure hosting you, and we look forward to your next visit!",
      "Obsessed is an understatement.Found this place on Yelp (I love you Yelp!) and with the rating and images I knew I was SOLD. The show stopping, craft cocktails is what I came for and I wasn't sure what to expect once we came. Was it a hype? Would I be disappointed? Who cares! You're in Miami and going to a Spanglish cocktail bar. We didn't make reservations but we did read it wasn't too hard to get in. And it was exactly just that. Came here at around 9:30 pm on a Saturday night and we were seated to the side entrance table with couches right away. It wasn't a good option for dining but we literally only came here for the cocktails so it was perfect!The vibe check in this place was everything. There was a live dj tucked in to the side making sure the music was on point. And it was!On to the craft cocktails:I ordered the Pornstar Mejican@ and it was delicious wish the mezcal was more of the star of the show and to be honest, given that everyone else's cocktails were truthfully visually so pleasing wish the presentation for this one was as well but that's totally ok!!! I still loved my experience. My hubby ordered the Cafetera Old Fashioned and WOW. What a presentation and fun way to serve it with an actual cafetera. It was definitely a show stopper. The Caipirinha Frizá was delicious and very unique as well and the Paparazzi came served in a photo lens so that was pretty cool!We loved Spanglish, would be back in a heart beat. Overall great vibes for cocktails and pretty cool presentation that really makes this place stand out. Excited to try their food next time!",
      "This place gives my New York Vibes OD! It's definitely giving New York Speakeasy Vibes. You'll probably miss it if your not paying attention because the sign outside is only a neon bottle sign. Inside is intimate with the cutest decor, low key, playing all the classic jams. I love a place that sets a vibe with an good playlist! Okayyy! We came for drinks after dinner, so we didn't order food but they did have a menu. All the drinks we ordered were sooo freakin good, and were in creative instagram worthy cups. This is definitely going to be my new hideaway spot. Service was amazing! Will be coming back!",
      "Okay, here's the thing with this place, it's so freaking loud that you can barely hear the person next to you, it's impossible to have any sort of conversation with a large group of people. The food was okay and drinks were pretty good on the other hand, so I think this is a good place for dates, just not a large gathering.",
      "Hi Anton, thank you so much for taking the time to share your experience at Spanglish.  We apologize for the music being too loud, and this is something we’re going to adjust.  Although, we’re happy to hear you enjoyed the drinks!We hope to see you again soon!",
      "What an awesome chic place.  Amazing craft cocktail & gastro pub style tapas.

      "The entrance to Spanglish is so subtle that it's easy to miss! Once you enter, the ambiance is cozy, intimate, and welcoming. We came because of the happy hour -- their cocktails were $9 and some small dishes were marked down! We ordered a round of the caipirinhas first and sadly were a bit disappointed, it was way more tart than expected and just tasted like lemon juice. The Chilcano tasted similar with the overpowering citrus. The Spanglish mule was way better! For small plates, we ordered the octopus croquettes, Caribbean dumplings, and a side of yuca. The octopus croquettes were my favorite of the items we ordered -- crispy, served hot, and the octopus inside was tender. The Caribbean dumplings were a little mushy, and the yuca was a bit tough and the sauce it was served with tasted like Big Mac sauce which I am not a fan of. Everything came out pretty fast, though!",
      "Finally got to visit Spanglish and let's just say I fell in love! I came here for happy hour with a friend and honestly we were blown away by how delicious everything was. We ordered the Spanish Milk Bread, Timba Frita, Queso E' Craba , and Tuna Tostadas. My favorite dish we tried was the Timbra Frita. It was the perfect bite full of flavor. We also ordered cocktails. We both ordered the Paparazzi which honestly tasted amazing but the presentation was killer. It comes served in a camera lens. Overall this place is a vibe. The music was lit. They were playing bad bunny. The artwork is awesome. I definitely see myself coming back here.",
      "Location a bit hidden in plain sight, so be sure to stop and read signs. Small  and intimate setting with a great ambiance for drinks and light bites with friends. The food was ok nothing over the top or extraordinary. I did like my margarita with the seafood bites. Drinks here before a walk around in Wynwood is never a bad idea.",
      "This place has no sign in front. We drive up and down and finally found it. Outside looks like it was closed. Nothing indicating it was opened except for a sign out front that shows menu of the day. We walked it and surprisingly was like wow. This is a cute small cozy restaurant.  The booth I say were pretty close to one another.  The bar area has 6 stools. The food was excellent! Extremely flavorful and so good. The octopus appetizer was amazing. We ordered one of their popular dish and weren't disappointed.  I forgot to photo that dish because I was so hungry.  Everything we had was great including the drinks. We love craft drinks and for sure it was super crafty. The paparazzi drink was so cute. It came in a camera cup and tasted great.I would be definitely coming back here again soon and recommend everyone to try if you haven't been here.",
      "Came here to try a few drinks on a Friday night and it wasn't as busy as I expected. I was able to sit at the bar and watch the bartender make these really cool looking and tasty drinks! The paparazzi was my favorite. Something about the dill and passion fruit combination was something I didn't know I needed. The vuela paloma was just okay, I'm just not the biggest fan of grapefruit. And the cafetera old fashioned tasted like a REALLY strong Cuban coffee, which I really enjoyed. Although the drinks were great, the vibe was kinda ruined by these drunk idiots sitting next to us at the bar, yelling and screaming. But I would still come here again to enjoy a cool curated cocktail."

      "Hands down my favorite restaurant in Miami. Ambiance is upbeat and intimate. Food is AMAZING does not miss in the year I've been going consistently. Service is outstanding .",
      "Amazing steakhouse Our favorite was the the Australian Wagyu which I can only say was perfection. their sides were so perfectly complimentary. Truffle Mac and cheese, the Brussels sprouts, spinach, broccolini and cauliflower were excellent. Beef lettuce wraps were decent, beet salad was good, kids meals were devoured. ALSO if you're here for breakfast their buffet is great",
      "WOW - To say I was completely blown away by my first time dining here would be an understatement. Whether you're celebrating a special occasion or just craving a delectable meal that will leave you speechless, this is the spot that will be sure to leave a lasting impression. From the lavish and trendy decor, the out of this world dishes, beautiful presentations and impeccable service, every detail was taken well into consideration and perfected.I can say with certainty that this is one of the most gorgeous spaces I've ever eaten a meal in. The sultry vibe, elegantly designed interior, endless display of wine bottles scattered throughout the restaurant and the stunning bar will have you feeling like you're in the midst of dining amongst celebrities. There didn't seem to be a bad table to dine at in sight, but my parents and I were lucky enough to snag one of the beautiful half-moon booths toward the center of the room. When is the last time you've been to a restaurant that brings complimentary French fries to the table? And not just any regular ole' French fries, but a delicious trio of French fries each complimented by their own unique dipping sauce? Bet it's probably never happened before, unless you've eaten here. I thought this was such a neat but simple touch that really set them apart from other high-end restaurants. They also bring yummy rolls topped with sea salt to the table (between the fries & the bread, you might end up in a food coma before you even order if you're not careful). I ordered the tuna tartar for an appetizer and I was in heaven every time I took a bite. Not only does it melt in your mouth, but the presentation alone is enough reason to order this (the way they mix it for you makes for a fun video opportunity if you have your phone ready to record). My parents shared a shrimp cocktail that they both enjoyed - The shrimp were massive! Following the appetizers, I munched on a cesar salad which was perfectly dressed. Now... the STEAK. Holy moly, one of the best filet mignons I have had yet. It was ridiculously flavorful, tender & juicy. Melted in your mouth and bursted with flavor. If you're a steak lover, it would be a crime to come here and not order it. The mashed potatoes that accompanied it were also flavorful, but I thought they were a little too runny (my only complaint of the whole meal). If you're a fan of grilled onions, do yourself a favor and order a side of these to top your steak with and thank me later. The \"Smoked Chocolate S'mores\" dessert was ridiculously decadent and was the perfect finish to an impeccable meal. Yes, it's insanely pricy and yes, it's totally worth it. My experience here was one of the best dining experiences I've ever had in Miami - And that says a lot given the fact that Miami is one of the hottest spots in the country for foodies. This restaurant hit it out the park for me and I'm already searching for an excuse to go back to South Florida and to savor new dishes on their menu.",
      "The restaurant is spacious and nice. Bar is nice as well.Staff was friendly and attentive.For appetizers the tuna tartare was fresh and seasoned well.They also bring you French fries 3 different ways with 3 different sauces. I had the certified Angus rib cap cooked medium rare and It was good and flavorful. The side of Mac and Cheese was good as well.",
      "Our favorite was the the Australian Wagyu which I can only say was perfection.",
      "Ambiance was awesome. The dishes, coctails and the dessert were so delicious. All the employees were so polite and friendly. They celebrated our honeymoon with a cute card, it was so nice.They made our special day unforgettable.",
      "Wonderful experience! Fabulous service. Timing, everything was a 10.  Our server really made our night fabulous, she was awesome. Great steak, Mac and cheese with truffle was really nice. Molten cake was super good as well. I must say everything was impeccable.",
      "Phenomenal cuisine. Never have a enjoyed such a succulent and flavourful sea bass - it is one of their renowned specials. But the lack of bones in the fish was made up for by the pained bones in my rear.The decor was beautiful but very far from comfortable. The low chairs were too uncomfortable for eating. The benches; built for slaves.The overall experience was truly hampered by a god awful designer deserving of life in prison for her domestic terror on comfort. 4/5 not bad",
      "This plus is amazing! We had a private room & our server was Erin. Erin was very pleasant, patient, informative & very professional. She suggested several appetizers & dinner. It was our first time visiting this restaurant & it definitely won't be our last.",
      "Food was incredible. I love that when you get to the table instead of getting some bread you get french fries. Service was also impeccable and ambiance is very family friendly in my opinion"

      "ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS... New Owners!! If you love Indian food... this is the place for you.   If you aren't familiar with Indian food... this is the place for you to learn.  The staff is great at making suggestions... Varun was our waiter last night and he was great.  Very attentive.  Spot on with his recommendations.  Very friendly and competent.  The food was delicious.  We had three different entrees... two appetizers and dessert.  The portions were a good size and quality ingredients.   Very large vegetarian options too. Wine selection is kinda limited... I plan to bring my own next time and pay a corkage fee.  Our plan is to keep coming back and try all of the entrees.  Highly recommend Indian Spice.",
      "Solid India food and  knowledgeable staff...  definitely worth a visit. The food scene on 79th street from Collins to Biscayne Blvd is really coming alive... worth a trip for casual Foodies.",
      "I previously gave four stars and compliments to this restaurant. However it was many months before we could make it back here, and I am afraid the entire experience has changed, making me wonder if ownership or management is new... the samosas were half the size, the Tikka Masala was a deep red color and tasted EXACTLY like Chef Boyardee Spaghettios from a can (obviously, they just spooned some tomato paste in to make more sauce and didn't even let it cook down to remove the bitterness). And worst of all, the Tandoori Chicken my friends ordered was covered in a thick grainy baste that contained a high level of something tasting like bleach.I am not one for insulting a restaurant for having a bad night, especially after I had such a great experience a few months previous. But the 100% change in food quality across the board was too alarming to let it slide this time. Obviously, nail in the coffin on this place for us. :(Go to Bombay Darbar instead. It's worth the drive to the Grove.",
      "Very sweet owners working and cooking here. Tender, super flavorful tandoori chicken! Delicious mimosas and chutney. Everything was great. This is a reliably good local spot.",
      "Had the chicken Saag which is a cream spinach based masterpiece. I normally do not go for spinach but this is not your regular plate. Varun was my waiter and he said it was the house special, so I took his suggestion and won big time.",
      "Great quality and amount per serving .  Fantastic flavors but ...It is soooooooooo spicy.  Even if you ask for the Mildest. Their \" mild\"  is too hot for the average person . After glasses and glasses of water couldnt finish it . Went home hungry. It's a shame b/c otherwise the food would be excellent. I do not know why do this,  you can always make it hotter for whomever requests it. Instead of loosing 90 % of patrons. That is where Zayka and Darbar get it right, and are always full. Indian food has so many wonderful spices why drown everything with heat instead of making it optional for you to add as much heat as you want.",
      "So Taste Buds of India is under new management and is now Indian Spice. Slightly high prices and small portions because Indian is treated like a delicacy in Miami. The food was delicious though. Service is very good. Interior is bright and clean. They also have a few tables outside in the Normandy Fountain square. They have lunch specials. I'll be back again soon.",
      "Amazing food! Friendly ambiance with a staff that makes you feel at home! Highly recommended!",
      "Super authentic and excellent service. Our server explained us the menu well and was very kind. Will come again soon.",
      "The food was alright but I really enjoyed the atmosphere. I feel like the food could have come a little quicker.",
      "Taste Buds of India..you were my all time favorite restaurant for my Indian food cravings but lately, I don't know what's going on with your food!!!I used to always get the Lamb vindaloo (Extra spicy) and kashmiri naan! Everything about them used to be perfect! The level of spice, the sweetness of the Kashmiri naan, just YUM! However, the last time I ordered from you guys, the lamb vindaloo was mainly just oil and the kashmiri naan was just alright..was a little lighter in the filling but still ok. We sometimes have a bad night so I decided to give you another chance!This time though definitely made me realize this will be the last time I ever order again from here unfortunately! I ordered a lamb tikka masala to change it up and my usual Kashmiri naan. The lamb tikka masala was a tiny portion and tasted like tomato sauce and cream mixed with little bits of meat. I have had better frozen Indian food than that! There were NO vegetables in it at all either. And the Kashmiri naan tasted like a regular naan! There was pretty much NO filling and was super unsatisfactory. So disappointing and what a waste of money :( Hope you guys can get back to the amazing quality you used to serve. But this is my goodbye",
      "Worst $50 delivery I've ever had. \"No onions\" salad loaded with onions. Lamb curry \"mild\" so spicy you could barely taste the meat. It looked like a bowl of spicy red sauce with the small pieces of meat swimming in it. Couldn't tell if it was lamb, dog, goat, with the amount of spicy sauce covering it. Definitely not much of it for the price. No other ingredients in it. Naan bread was unremarkable. On a positive note - jasmine rice was good and delivery took less than 30 min. I think it's because they just microwaved some of the leftovers from the day before, lol. Next time I'll just get a can of Dinty Moore stew from the gas station. Much cheaper and same amount of enjoyment."

I had to drink the sangria red it was ok as well. It's a nice spot to visit but will I go again no.",
      "Super fun place to go for brunch in Miami Beach. Way cool atmosphere and cute theme. Not kid friendly. Blaring loud music (Doja Cat, Drake) and all of the staff very friendly and attentive. The word bitch is thrown around frequently (in a good way).  The drinks are very strong and the food is cooked to perfection. The most perfect bacon I've eaten. Eggs cooked perfectly, with melted cheese and perfect croissant. Definitely an experience. Atmosphere: 5 starsFood: 5 stars   Taste: 5 stars  Uniqueness: 5 stars  Presentation: 4 stars Service: 5 stars Take away:  does not need salt! Highly recommend for brunch",
      "Stopped by here for brunch before my flight. Seated very quickly being greeted by a waitress who enthusiastically greeted us with a \"hi b*tches!!\" I think the restaurant is very cohesive with their theme of bitches, very light hearted and fun. Their outdoor seating is super cute but the chairs are VERY uncomfortable and the metal chairs are very low compared to the table.In terms of the food, I enjoyed my Classy sandwich. Wasn't amazing though. Like the fried chicken portion tasted like something I picked up from a seven eleven ready to eat section. It was good but not amazing. Checked in through yelp and got a complimentary Cafe con leche. It was alright. Somewhat bitter despite asking for sugar added and milk. Not amazing, didn't really want to finish it. The drink only came out later when I was basically 3/4 done with my sandwich.In general I think this was a pretty standard brunch place, the food doesn't strike out as amazing but the cool consistent \"bitch\" theme is interesting and worth a visit. total ratings: food - 3/5vibes - 5/5service - 4/5",
      "Service wasNot so great took forever to get my Bloody Mary The entertainment and ambiance was awesome though Food was good Bloody Mary was amazing",
      "The sandwich is a regular croissant sandwich, however executed VERY WELL. The egg was cooked to perfection  the perfect gooeyness! The service was speedy and the servers were very nice. They kept giving pineapple shots so that was dope. WARNING the name matches the theme. The service will greet and service you using the term \"bitch\" so it was cool the first couple times and then it gets annoying. The restaurant was packed! All seating is OUTDOOR, however there was a bar you could stand and order drinks at. Again it was a great sandwich and good vibes , I'd do again for the experience",
      "Let me start off by saying this restaurant is everything. If you're having a bad day, just go to Bacon Bitch and your whole mood will change. I love the vibe from all the workers and the food is good. The music that they play makes you want to get up and dance while you eat. I was in Miami for Memorial Day weekend and wanted to go then, but the line was wrapped around the corner and now I understand why. I ordered the Classy sandwich, Crispy hash brown, and the Emotion frozen drink. Everything was good. I did have one problem, but it didn't have to do with the restaurant, the birds are very disrespectful and will fly up and eat the food right off your plate.",
      "Great service and fantastic food. We ordered the OG sandwich and the shrimp and grits. The prices were great for what we got, and with the Yelp check-in, we got two free cafe con leches! Shrimp and grits came with a lot of shrimp; we left full and satisfied. Super fun place to eat. It's a party vibe at the restaurant and everyone seemed like they were enjoying themselves! Only come if you're ready for loud bumping music energy. Crowded so make sure to get a reservation beforehand to avoid waiting for too long. Definitely recommend and would come back",
      "Glad to finally have tried the hyped up Bacon Bitch.  Very nice staff, fun catchy theme to the name of the establishment to go with the menu options.  Very mediocre food.  The main menu consists of basic croissant sandwiches, but the croissants weren't fresh or flaky as expected.  Of course while eating in touristy Miami, prices are high, but $21+ for a basic non-fresh croissant was a let down.  I will add, that you will be charged $5 for a cup of water...yes $5!  My little one order the pancakes, not your typical, flat round pancakes.  They are thick and small.Will I visit this establishment again, probably not due to the many options of food outside of a basic croissant.  Great for social media pictures though.",
      "Came back here after having a fun time a few years ago. The place looked a little different and bigger, not sure if they expanded. We didn't have a RSVP so we had to wait a little bit, which was ok since we decided to get some drinks while we waited. We got the frozen drinks- drunk bitch, Miami, and the hustle. They had a gooood amount of liquor in them but were delicious and refreshing. Our waitress was super nice and friendly. We got the boujee, chicken and waffles, steak and eggs. All the food was good, but you really come for the fun time haha. We were celebrating two of our friends bdays, they come around to all the tables with small shots! Good vibes and good food",
      "This spot was on my list due to the name itself. Anything dealing with bacon, I'm in. I also got a heads-up that I'll be called a \"bitch\" when I'm greeted, & I forgot that quick once it happened and the greeter busted out laughing. First impression for real. Everything is \"bitch\" related: Main Bitches (breakfast/brunch croissants), Naked Bitches (steak & eggs, chicken & waffles, vegan, etc), Side Bitch (which is very fitting of all of the sections) and so forth. Main section gave me a hard time, there were so many combinations with the croissants, I tiled with Classy. Southern Fried Chicken Breast, pickles, mayo (subbed for Bitch Sauce) & hot honey.It was exactly what I needed. Nice sized chicken breast with the right amount of hot honey. Pickles are always the move with a chicken sandwich & I'm glad I tried the Bitch Sauce, which was vinaigrette-esque, sweet & salty with a tang. Plenty of bacon (of course) & as I was eating, I should've added cheese. Good all-around.The service from the moment I got there was second to none. Very consistent, wait time to be served wasn't long at all & enjoyed the view sitting on the front patio. Also, lookout for birds, they fly freely in & out of the front patio area.",
      "Hey Gary !  Thanks for such a detailed review. Our first impression is definitely a memorable one for sure. We’re glad you enjoyed your time brunchin’ with the B*tches. We’re excited to see you again soon!"

There is some amazing history here and it was a great a place to hang out for drinks and appetizers. We had to wait about 10 mins for a small table to open up and the service was quick and the beer was cold!  If you are in the area, make your way here and enjoy!",
      "I hated it, considered it a tourist trap, as food was expensive and portions were tiny. It was around 2-3 pm and was not full at all, but the service was horrible, don't remember her name, but she was not Hispanic, she had no interest in serving us or answering questions even though we told her we had never been there. The one good thing I will give them-was the mini Cuban sandwich, but the price for the portion was ridiculous. We will definitely not return.",
      "Great place to go and enjoy live Cuban music with friendly staff but didn't care for the food nor the drinks. We went on a Saturday night at 7pm for dinner and live music. We made a reservation since there was 14 of us. When we arrived we had to wait 15 minutes, since our table wasn't ready. Once we were seated it took a while for our server to come and take our drink orders. Once she took all the orders  we waited more then 1/2 hour to get our drinks.  we understood the wait time since there were 14 orders. But then it took our server 1/2 hour more to come back and take our entree orders.  And it was so loud that our server couldn't hear us so we had to write it down on our phones to show her what we wanted to order. So for drinks I had the mojito, which was ok, but there was way to much ice for my liking. For the entree, I ordered the fish tacos and the Guava pastry. The taco was mediocre and the Guava pastry wasn't bad. But the music was great!  I would go back just for the music. Go eat somewhere else and come here for the music!",
      "Maria B, you were a rockstar and deserve 5 stars! We walked in to no space left and a few reserved signs but she made it work for us. The drinks were so, so good! We got a few and the night was so good that I don't remember the names lol. Maria was very attentive and made great recommendations. We also got vegetarian tacos and they were very well made with fried yucca in them. Very flavorful! The live music was truly popping and people were dancing happily. It was a delight and highly recommend!!We do recommend reservations if you can get them, otherwise look around for bar seating.",
      "During our tour of Little Havana we stopped in for a tequila shot snd my friend got a draft beer. The bar area was pretty crowded on a Friday afternoon.  Mostly due to people popping in to watch the live band. You could hear the music from the street. People were singing along and dancing on the sidewalk.  The band was very entertaining and they even invite guest to play along. There was a box of tambourines and bongos to choose from. Since it was my friends birthday I cheered her on to dance and sing alongside the band. We had fun and enjoyed our drinks then back to the tour.",
      "Okay, so it is a tourist trap -- I am a tourist!  The live street music pulled us in, along with the five open bar stools in front of the band.  We ordered some cocktails and hung out and listened to this band play that was GREAT.  I had the most delicious cocktail there -- Calle Ocho Old Fashioned.  a MUST try.",
      "What a vibe! Great location in Little Havana, a nice large, central bar surrounded by seating and dancing peeps makes for challenging order situation but the bartenders did a good job keeping things straight.There was a free Salsa group class, which was the reason we went, but first the live band... man it was so enjoyable to just listen to their cuban latin music ... people moving to the rhythm just having a fantastic time! Once they were done, the instructor guy came and, in this narrow section on one side of the bar, some 25 of us squeezed in and followed along. He was an amazing dancer though it was difficult to hear his instructions. It was less of a lesson than follow-along. When that short 30-min passed, more people broke out and serious salsa couples came out and just graced the floor. The level was high. They also had an outdoor space to the back which wasn't used but overall this was a happening place in town for sure. Highly recommend to couples visiting, locals, and GROUPS to just come and put on those dancing shoes & blaze that dance floor! I'm coming back soon... after taking some salsa lessons. :P",
      "Pros: the guava croquetas were AMAZING! We went for drinks and had a few snacks. Plenty of seating, chill vibe, great service. Will def come back for dinner.Cons: you gotta pay for parking, but that's Miami!",
      "Imagine Little Havana on a hot night in Miami...This place is smack dab in the middle of Little Havana. Upon entering, it's very dimly lit with ample seating at the bar and booth seating around it with a few tables. There was live salsa music and an area to dance too. We opted to sit at the bar and ordered the chicharones, wings and drinks. Honestly, every drink they has was delicious as was the food. The chicharones were crispy yet tender in sections that had meat still attached. I mean VERY VERY GOOD! The wings were seasoned just right and cooked to perfection. For the ambiance, food and drinks...this place is a must stop on my list. The service is great too with the bar staff being very much attentive during our entire visit.",
      "I HONESTLY FELT LIKE I WAS IN CUBA!  Everything about this place screams Little Havana. There's this handsome older man who sits in the front of the restaurant and walks costumers to their seats. THE BAND!!!! THE BAND IS AMAZING!  They have live music... or at least they did on veteran's day around lunch time and every song they played was fantastic. THE FOOD: We had just gotten off a cruise so weren't too hungry... decided to order their jerk wings and some sangria with a mojito- none disappointed. PARKING: LOCATED ON A MAJOR STREET... can't imagine the chaos at night when this place is happening. THE VENUE: Has a lot of character... in the back there's a mini stage with seating for guests although it was closed when we were there. In all.... great experience.  If we ever came back to Miami we'd definitely stop by here again."

      "Oh Yeah!  Love the menu and the service. Get the kids the cinnamon roll!All of our dishes came right out and yummy.",
      "This place is too cute. I was looking for a sweet breakfast spot on Miami beach and happened to find Sunnyside while out on a walk. It's tucked away from the main drive so it's not overly crowded, but by the time I left almost every seat was filled. I love how \"homey\" it feels. It almost feels like you're sitting on someone's porch or in the kitchen. The menu is large for how small it is and they serve up some popular breakfast options like pancakes, waffles, acai bowls and avocado toast.  With so many options I ended up with pancakes and the acai bowl. I added the berries compote to the pancakes to top it off. Portion size on both items were big enough to share with another person. Overall, really cute spot with a lot of options. Perfect if you're looking for that laid back, easy beach day vibe.",
      "We only stopped for a quick bite and it did not disappoint. Thanks to fellow, amazing yelpers we had already decided to order the French toast. We went for classic with berries compote. It was delicious! The toast was crispy on the outermost layer and melt in the mouth soft on the inside. The compote and fresh berries added just the right amount of sweetness. It was so right! Also, the place is dog friendly!",
      "I'm sort of obsessed with this place for brunch.  It's close to home.  It's cute with outdoor seating and I love their brunch menu options.  I've tried the scrambles, the croquet madame, the salad and a bunch of other things I can't remember right now and all were great.  The coffee is good and the prices are reasonable.  They have cute outdoor seating and service is awesome.  They are quick with the food but they don't rush you out when you're done with your meal.  Very solid, well-priced brunch spot on the beach.",
      "I really really liked this spot! We stumbled upon it after our original plans fell through and it was not a let down. The vibe is cute, the menu is extensive, and the food is good. It's not too expensive, but it's also not cheap. I got the huevos rancheros and turkey sausage. The huevos were super good and the turkey sausage was good quality. My boyfriend got the hash browns with Brie and blueberries. It was good but I had wished that the hash browns weren't the patties, I think it would have been better if they were the crispy shredded style-but that's personal preference. The service was quick and kind.",
      "As beautifully presented, it was equally delicious. Coffee was excellent ( just had drip coffee) orange juice was fresh. The set up is adorable.",
      "This was one of the most delicious brunches I have had in recent memory. Wonderful prompt & friendly service as well. Fair prices. We had the key lime pancake, caccio peppe omelette and a side of the hash browns w Brie cheese & blueberry compote. Everything tasted so good! And the presentation was beautiful! Please open in NYC!!!",
      "Cute little bistro at South Beach. A bit hidden on a parking lot but really nice option for breakfast, brunch and afternoon coffee. We became regular for food after our weekend workout at the beach. Nice service and good quality food. Would recommend the truffle omelette and Belgium Chocolate waffles .",
      "Good place.  Has a local feel. Had the avocado toast.  Nothing special.Prosciutto Crudo- okWill say that other dishes looked yummy.",
      "Yummm brunch here was so tasty! Tucked on a street in South Beach, Sunnyside is a cute little cafe with outdoor seating. The perfect spot for an Instagram worth breakfast! The portions were big and the food was pretty delicious. -1 star because the service was a bit slow and the iced coffee was pretty meh. (PS. Pretty much everywhere in Miami charges an automatic 18-20% gratuity!)"

      "Raw oysters, stone crab and whites clams too. Boats and fishing every weekend too. Thanks you, Dr. Jacqueline Sacco MD PhD",
      "I made it a mission to go out of my way for this effusively talked about seafood restaurant and market, wanting to get my paws on some stone crab that wouldn't cost me an arm and a leg like it would at the famous Joe's. Alas, they weren't carrying them the day I visited, but I was just happy to have a whole menu of fresh seafood at my fingertips.This place is truly in the cut, in an area of Little Havana with long stretches of empty fields and urban blight, including train tracks and a cemetery way at the edge of town. I suppose most people around here would drive to and fro, but us New Yorkers were stomping around on foot, and it wasn't the most hospitable place in the city. I was so relieved when we landed at the restaurant and found friendly staff and an inviting menu.The seafood tacos and shrimp sandwich we ordered were satisfactory, but wasn't really worth going out of my way for. My dreams of a really stand out seafood meal were dashed, but I'm not mad about the adventure it took me on.",
      "Inside and outside seating, with a very small parking lot shared with other businesses. Pay to park is available on the side streets.We ordered the fried lobster tail that came with 1 side. The waitress said the Market Price was $36 for the lobster. The lobster was amazing lightly fried to perfection. The Hawaiian plantain was very hard do not recommend, had to chew this very slowly.We didn't order the sweet plantain the waitress got our order incorrect. The sides are pricy the plantain was $5.15 for 5 pieces so im paying $1 per piece. She also said the lobster was enough for 2 people, it is not. Definitely order more food. She never checked back at our table so we could send the plate back, so we just ate it because we were still hungry after the lobster. We got the bill and the lobster ended up being $42 because she said it was $36 per POUND.  This wasn't mentioned we assumed every order of lobster would be the price she told us. We liked the food and will go back but didn't like all the miscommunication with our waitress so I took a star off. All of this could have been avoidable.",

      "Love love this spot! We always start off with the oysters and fried lobster, both were delicious.",
      "What a gem of a seafood place in Little Havana. I stumbled upon this restaurant by sheer accident bypassing traffic during rush hour. Glad I stopped by the first time. The seafood here is fresh! I enjoyed a corvina sandwich the first time and recently came back for the fish burrito. Both were great. They also have a very good happy hour for drinks and food. Service has always been good and I definitely will come back.",
      "A place to go for good seafood that really is not overly expensive. A nice variety of dishes including Corvina, Mahi Mahi, Oysters...and that's just a start.",
      "Corvina was tasty and flaky...during lunch two of us got seated and were attended to right away...no beer though....an import with the fish would have been best.",
      "Yeah man, it's good But the prices have gone up A lotBut it's good...really goodAndIt's Good FridaySo yeahThey take credit card now so they get an extra star",
      "I'm giving this place three stars because the food IS really good and the service is excellent. Those two thing would usually merit a 4 or 5 star review from me but I really do not like this placeLet me explain but first a questionWhat muthereffin year are we in? it is 2015 right?? Then why does a place like this, as successful as it is only take cash. I've seen hobos on the side of the road with a credit card reader accepting credit card handouts but not Mr. Camaronera Speaking of Mr. Shrimpnice guy sorta but a bit of an indian giver",
      "Found this spot on the way to the airport for a quick bite & that's exactly what it was. The staff was nice & the restaurant was clean. All the seafood we had tasted fresh and lightly/deliciously seasoned. It's definitely a local friendly spot as we met some local there who speak highly of this place. I would recommend this to anyone craving seafood & wanting a quick bite.",

      "MILA IS the best resturant in Miami. They have brought on world famous Michelin Star Chef Michael Michaelidis. The foi gras was a 10/10 and the Dover sole pan was the best fish I have ever had. How does this taste so good ?! The staff are attentive and fast. We had multiple people check on our table. The interior of the resturant is very well done. This is the first time I felt the price was warranted in Miami.",

      "What amazing brunch experience at MILA restaurant! The drink menu was incredible and all drinks were delicious! It is a boozy brunch Included in the pricing. NOW! The food! sooo much food! Is a multi course buffet experience! You get to walk around the beautiful restaurant and pick what you want to eat! They have everything you can imagine. A veggie section, a Suchi section, a grill outside in the garden, meats section and an amazing dessert section!  My favorites were the salmon, the octopus ceviche, the steak was cooked to perfection honestly. Too hard to pick everything but you will enjoy this beautiful place. Now the staff was super friendly and accommodating. They explain the menu very well and the options and you always have a drink on hand. You don't even have try to ask they will be there before you take the last sip of your current drink hahaha love it!!Music will be playing during brunch and this time around they had a life band which was Amaixng and so much fun!! Must visit when in Miami! SO MUCH FUN!",

      "Decided to go to MILA as our big one night out spot in Miami. We came with a late reservation (we'll late for us haha 10 pm), we were immediately met with mean mugging hostesses. This was the only bad mark on a otherwise amazing evening. These hostesses were so judgmental and rude. 100% looked us up and down (I am a curvy girl and my friend is a tall black women) gave us why are you here attitude and immediately sat all of the skinny girls who came in after us. Thankfully the rest of our experience here was so good and that we stayed, cus we did talk about leaving after those girls. We got sat right in the back, in front of the open kitchen in the corner booth table. Loved getting to see everything come out of the kitchen.We started our evening with a bottle of Road to Osaka sake, it's a semi sweet cloudy sake. It was nice but it was hard for us to finish the entire bottle. This is a shared plate type of place, where dishes come out as they are ready. We started with a fried chicken dish, delicious but sadly not on the menu anymore, and some satay glazed chicken. These were good not super special but good. We ordered two sushi rolls; Salmon Avocado Maki and Spicy tuna roll with tuna on top. Both were very fresh and good, the salmon had an interesting tomato chutney on it that we've never experienced before. We also got a side of fried eggplant & zucchini chips that I was in love with. Perfectly fried with just the right amount of salt. Our waitress was new, if she didn't mention it we would have had no idea, but was so pleasant and kind. She gave us a few recommendations of places to stop into while we were in the area. Really wish I got her name because she was the highlight of our night!Before you leave make sure you stop by the outdoor space to check it out and to take a cute pic!",

      "Food - orgasmic. Can I say that on here? Tuna tartare was delectable. I could eat that all day. The rice chips that were paired with it were amazing, too. Drinks were all delicious. Everything tasted fresh and it was a fun experience trying some new foods. Price - lol. If you're worried about the price, just move along. We managed to spend $500 in total for the two of us including service charge and tax. The food is beyond excellent, but you're definitely paying for the whole experience. Service - really great. It was my boyfriends birthday and they came over with a small birthday dessert. Our waiter was knowledgeable and attentive. I'd recommend sitting on the terrace, but the indoor seating is still a solid choice. Very comfortable seating which is important. Do I recommend coming here? Yes, but it depends. If you're in Miami and you want the high end experience with some bomb insta photos, book your MILA table now. This would make for a fun splurge night. If you're trying to budget yourself, maybe skip MILA. There are a lot of other options with food just as amazing if not better for a smidge better price.",

      "MILA deserves the entirety of the 5 stars. I still dream of this meal! I want to go back now.They have valet parking for $20. You might have luck finding parking yourself because there are a few streets you can look at nearby. Then once arriving, you take an elevator upstairs. The restaurant is beautiful. The view is beautiful. The scene is popping. When we came, we were pleasantly surprised they had a belly dancer who also was a flame blower?We were a party of 3 and had a reservation. Once the entire party was present, we were quickly seated. The best part of the entire experience at MILA? The food. My table ordered a few items to share but the most memorable dish that I still dream about? The truffle cream spaghetti. Whatever doubts you have - maybe it's too buttery - maybe the truffle is overpowering - drop it. Their truffle cream spaghetti dish was the best thing we had all night.Another honorable mention, the kalbi shortribs. Would've thought I was at a Korean restaurant. The Kalbi was amazing! Mouthwatering. Great flavor and filling. Also tried the octopus and hamachi crudo. Both great appetizers. Finally, I had notified our server that we were celebrating birthdays and we had a sparkler come out with our dessert! Very picture-worthy. I would love to revisit MILA soon.",
      "It was girls night with one of my besties and Mila was one of our to go places. Customer service: Omg wonderful! We had people checking on us, removing our plates, adding water for us, cleaning our plates. They are everywhere. It was wonderful. Our waitress was amazing, i forgot her name but i think it was Julia lol might be wrong. Drink: I ordered a beach walk, it definetly did not taste like there was alcohol in that drink but it was refreshing. (Not pictured) Food: 10/10. The food are so tasty, proportions are not that bad. Everything is about sharing so that made it really cute. Gyoza was great. The burrata was very well seasonedddd, it was great. Beef tenderloin!!! Take it, it was amazing. We also had the brocolini which is not pictured. Since we went to celebrate my birthday, we also had a lava cake and it was so good that i forgot to take a picture, there was a matcha on the side, it was so refreshing and tasty. Price: Overall, our total came out to be $252 which honestly was worth it. Coming back or nah? Aboslutely coming back.",
      "The hostess stand almost ruined our night. We had a reservation for 8 girls at 7 on a Friday night. Most of the party had arrived and they were told to sit and wait. 3 of us were downstairs taking photos by the entrance and when we came up, they did not want to seat us because it was 7:15. However, the 5 girls who arrived on time were not advised of any time limit (we would have taken pictures after). Eventually we were seated.The food was absolutely delicious though very small portions and I do think a little overpriced. That's Miami Beach for you though! We shared all the plates so I look forward to going again with a smaller party for a fuller belly. I did leave a bit hungry that night.",
      "My family and I came here on a Wednesday night for a nice dinner out. We got to sit outside which was a gorgeous oasis with water ponds and fire dancers. Very comfortable lounge seating. The service was great. The items are a bit pricey but worth it for the overall experience and execution and flavors of the food. Kinda small servings so I recommend ordering a lot for the table to share. The seafood and sushi is amazing, as well as the truffle pasta and chicken satay.",

I tried multiple things and they were all good: - Fiocchi de Pera (pear and cheese pasta) OBSESSED - Fettuccine Allo Scoglio (seafood with pasta) very good - Rucola E Mandorle (salad) - tasty- cannolo - yummy- panna cotta - delicious The pasta of that day had blue crab meat and asparagus and was tasty as well. The service was excellent and so was the food. Their reputation proceeds them very well!",
      "Nice Italian. Popular with the folks living in the nearby apartments/condos as it was packed on a Monday night. Fresh pasta. They will make some of the more standard pasta dishes that are off of the menu as well. Lasagna was good and hearty. Limited beer selection to around four different light lagers. Larger wine list. Some seating outside - but it wasn't that nice as it is a narrow sidewalk and your table is right up against the parked cars. Friendly and attentive staff. It is in a nice part of town - seemed rather a safe area.",
      "I was very excited to check out Fratelli because on Yelp they have solid reviews. My advice is not to be deceived by its ambience because it's actually a much better restaurant than what it actually looks. The service was great. There able to accommodate for our group and sit us in a table next to the window. Our waitress was attentive and super friendly, I felt welcomed and pleased to be there. The food was absolutely delicious. I highly recommend the Fiocchi Di Pera and the Fettuccine Allo Scoglio. The seafood was not over cooked and it wasn't tough. The meal came hot but the plate was warm, which tells me they didn't just put it in the microwave, it's made to order. The pasta is also homemade which makes it that much better and overall everything tastes fresh. Overall I'm very pleased with our experience and I highly recommend trying it out.",
      "Only in Miami three nights. On last night, had their lasagna door dashed to our AirBnB. Three of us ate and for 2/3 of us, it was the best lasagna we had ever had. The other thought it was very good (our weak link, lol). Can't speak to anything else but damn was the lasagna awesome.",
      "My last night in Miami and we had our last business dinner here.This was absolutely delicious meal from start to finish. We ordered the beef carpaccio, eggplant Parmesan, truffle fries, to shareand my personal dish was the bucatini san babila and creme brûlée.  My favorite dish was the bucatini--the tubular pasta, italian sausage, fresh shaved pecorino cheese. It was so good that I set some aside to take home and eat as leftovers.The food was amazing, the service was amazing! If I am ever in Miami again,I will definitely return. I highly recommend this place!",
      "Late post haven't been back to Fratelli in sometime; but I say one of the most incredible homemade pasta in Downtown Miami  fun time, incredible food, beautiful wine list that matches the meal. Incredible service always busy. Grazie mille per esserti preso cura di me e della mia famigilia Ciao!",
      "I went for lunch here with a co-worker and I was pleasantly surprised. The restaurant is nice and service was pretty good.  We ordered the Burrata Caprese as a starter and it was pretty good. My entree was the fettuccine with pink sauce and I asked them to add salmon. That was so yummy!  Prices were a bit high but it is kind of normal in Miami nowadays so we didn't mind.  This is definitely a good find. I would go back, for sure.",
      "I cane here late on a Saturday and they accommodated us with no problems, the service was quick and friendly. We ordered the pasta bolognese with steak and holy schmoly omg what is in that pasta because me and my friend were dying it was so good. We wanted more and more. The meat was tender flavorful pasta was fresh and did not cause any bloating whatsoever it was so nice!! I keep dreaming about it! I want more!! Lovely place. They also let us stay till the very very end. Did not kick us out even though it was way past closing time.",
      "Came here for dinner and had a good experience. We ordered the traditional bruchetta for an apetizer which was delicious very light and flavorful. For the entrées we ordered the seafood pasta and the filet mignon pasta. They were both good, I preferred the filet mignon pasta. However, I did feel that the dishes were very salty. So much so that I couldnt finish my seafood pasta. For dessert we ordered penna cotta (one of my fav desserts, so I had high expectations) and it was very very good. It was very thick and rich and the cream on top tasted very fresh. Loved the floural design with different sauces, it allows for trying the penna cotta with different flavors such as chocolate, lime, and strawberry.Overall, nice place, nice atmosphere and good food. I want to come back and try their pizza and more dessert!",
      "I'm a sucker for any city restaurant with outdoor seating right next to the road, and this spot made me feel like I was sitting on the streets of Milan sipping my red wine and living the high life. To start off, the bruschetta was phenomenal. We got the one with prosciutto, roasted tomatoes, and goat cheese -- pesto on the side for everyone else because sadly I'm allergic to pine nuts. Then I had the special pasta of the night because I'm a sucker for limited time specials. It consisted of thick, flat noodles (which apparently are handmade daily at this place), peas, smoked salmon, and vodka sauce topped off with a big hunk of burrata cheese. Mine was so delicious and my friends thoroughly enjoyed their dishes as well -- highly recommend!",
      "This place is amazing. From the first bite, can tell that fresh made pasta. It is some of the best Italian I have ever had including in Italy. We are very grateful to the owner for finding us a table inside on christens eave after table initially offers was outside but it was very cold and windy outside. Family of five at this restaurant got to enjoy great 5 dishes and argue who had the best meal. The shrimp bisque creamy light tomato based. Great service. Great sauces as far as tomato sauce in the pappardelle and ragu great pear flavored filling Great creamy risotto dish Great desserts options especially the chocolate cake and dulce penne cota This place is amazing. must visit. Great atmosphere food and service"

The manager was constantly interacting with guests in the dining room, ensuring absolute satisfaction with the dining experience. Great place, we'll definitely be back!",
      "I love Indian food, and when I say Indian food, I am talking about the food with all the bells and whistles and spices and peppers and what not, not tla watered-down version of it. But that is the dilemma all Indian (and even Thai) restaurants face. Tlan Indian dish prepared properly is considered too spicy (or even intolerable) to most westerners. So they have to provide a mild version of their food by removing some of the spices, or in some cases I have even seen them add yogurt to the gravy to make it less spicy. All these change the flavor or even texture of the food, and youvare ko longer eating the food as it was intended, but rather a different version of itThe funny thing is that I used to be one of those who couldn't handle the heat, but after working 30 years in IT (which is shocking since I am only 35, lol) and having many Indian friends and going out to lunch with them, I slowly started to mot only tolerate, but also enjoy, appreciate, and even yearn the flavor of all the spices.What I like about Bombay Darbar, aside from service and professionalism, is that they have managed to have slightly less spicy variations of the food without changing the flavor of the food drastically. Everything is very good. Last time I had lamb Roganjosh and it was amazing. If you go there for the first time and don't know what to order, order that. Great food, great experience. Can't wait to go back.",
      "This is one of the few Indian restaurants in the Miami area which I like. The ambiance of this place is good!The restaurant is huge and they accept reservations. The service is good too. I wouldn't say this is authentic Indian food though ‍. The tandoori chicken was great! Overall I would recommend this place",

      "This may be our tenth time here, when we don't know where to go we always end up here.  We have never been disappointed.  Yesterday Alejandro attended us super friendly and with the best disposition.  The food was as always great, the only thing that I must point out that made me sad was my Mango Martini, I don't know if they changed the bartender or if yesterday the restaurant was too crowded, but the drink lacked quantity and quality.  Usually in the past the glass was filled to the brim garnished with red pepper and salt and at the bottom too, the consistency was very thick.  None of this had my Martini yesterday, I let Alejandro know and the second time he improved somewhat but never like in the past.  I hope it's just random situation.",

      "Bombay Darbar was highly recommended by Miami locals! Overall, their food was pretty good. The paneer tikka masala and saag paneer were good. I think the portion sizes were very small for the price. Out of all the indian spots I tried in Miami, Bombay Darbar is a solid option for north indian food. There isn't much parking in this area FYI! We had to park in a near by garage that was $20.",
      "Delicious food, complimentary/unlimited rice, and quick service! I came here with a group of 7 and had a very good experience. I tried the veggie samosas, dal soup, and lamb pasanda. I always get my curry mild and I was happy with it, though others in my group ordered medium and hot and said it could have been spicier.",
      "I wish I came to this place more often when I worked in the area. Such good consistent food and decent portions. One of my top two Indian restaurants here in miami which are so familiar to those I tried while in india. I was really surprised by the coconut lime cocktail. Beautiful presentation and just the perfect mix of flavors, a bit on the sweet side but so good it I'll risk the sugar high. I had lamb chops which were so flavorful and delicious. My friend had chicken tikka which was also a hit, I just wish there was more meat to sauce ratio. I also had the samosa which were pretty good.",
      "Bombay Darbar is my favorite Indian restaurant in Miami, I have tried many others but none will compare to Bombay. The service is always so great, we are regulars so we have gotten to know the servers & manager. The food is always amazing which is why I have continued to come back for years! My go to order is:Appetizers: Chili Paneer & Vegetable SamosasEntrees: Dal Tadka, Tandoori Lamb Chops, Garlic NaanDessert: Mango or Pistachio KulfiThe lamb vindaloo, aloo gobi, and tandoori shrimp are all great entrees as well.You can't go wrong with my order and anything else off the menu at Bombay because everything is delicious and if you're looking to beat the crowd definitely come on a weekday!"

      "Make a reservation and make your way to a delicious dinner. Amal is a newer Lebanese restaurant in the coconut grove area and it's definitely the best addition! Great service, great drinks, beautiful decor, ambiance, great music but not too loud to over power conversations, and the star of it all-- the food! My friends and I ordered items to share and it was the best idea: - Dips Sampler Trio -Hummus, labneh, baba ghanoush -Truffle Rakakat -Chicken Skewers -Falafel With basmati rice and house friesThere was so much more on the menu we would of wanted to try but were completely satisfied with our order. Everything was prepared to perfection, flavorful and filling. Can't wait to be back! 10/10 experience.",
      "one of my favourite restaurants in Miami and coral gables area! We were a little perplexed why they weren't answering their phone after repeated attempts at calling to make a reservation but nevertheless we came here one weekday evening to a bustling restaurant. The restaurant itself is a vibe, comfortable but upscale without being snobby. great place to come for a special occasion or just to catch up with some friends. Dirty martini here was great! We decided to do family style and everything was delicious. although I was a little worried because we didn't order a lot of meat and I thought we would still be a hungry after the combination of everything definitely filled us up. Would def recommend zucchini chips and the Amal hummus. I don't think you can necessarily go wrong with anything on the menu here tho. After drinks and food the total came out to around 70$ per person. Well worth in my opinion :)",
      "This restaurant opened in the Grove recently and it's easily my new favorite. The food is a modern take on Lebanese cuisine, and it's delicious. My favorites were the hummus sampler, the truffle rakakat (this was the star dish for me), the marinated olives, the octopus, and the skewer platter for two. I did not care for the chicken wings (actually, I disliked them). The overall ambiance of the restaurant is beautiful and the cocktails are nice. I have already gone back and have a feeling I will have a third visit soon.",
      "Amal is located in Coconut Grove and offers a Lebanese fare. The decor is inviting and chic. We came for brunch on Saturday with a group of 6 and the staff sat us quickly. We ordered many things to share and was kind of disappointed at the staff seeing we are 6 and not pointing out that some appetizers come with 4 servings or 5 servings when we are 6. The food options will please all dietary restrictions. Your can't leave without trying their Truffle Rakakat, it really stood out for me.The staff seemed a bit pretentious as if the restaurant belonged in Brickell and not Coconut Grove.I love the flavors and would definitely be back.",
      "It's so hard to pick a great restaurant in Miami that is worth the financial investment - both from the food and service perspective.   Let me introduce you to Amal!Picked a Monday to celebrate our wedding anniversary in Miami, and after booking severalOther \"very hyped\" places, you know from the owners of LIV and such.... I settled with Amal because the husband loves Lebanese food. From the moment we arrived, the service was friendly (which, is rare in Miami). I had a reservation (this is a MUST even on a Monday) and asked if we could be seated outside, which they happily did.Our server was friendly and honest. How refreshing! He admitted that he was vegetarian and had not tried the meat dishes but pointed out what people always raved about, and even provided great recommendations for portions for two people ( he wanted to make sure we could sample as much as we wanted, without getting completely full at the beginning of the meal)And sampled we did.... Here's what you NEED in your life from Amal: 1) Truffled rakakat ( it's cheese melted inside a taquito (delicate phyllo dough really, but taquito came to mind) covered in truffled honey and pistachio) WOW!  2) Amal's Hummus - the most delicate, softest beef tenderloin in a bed of hummus.  Never has hummus tasted like this.... I'll be dreaming about this humus. 3) pistachio Kabab - my husband said: \" a kabab is a kabab\"- wrong!!  This was minced lamb and beef that was soft and juicy in a bed of fresh grilled veggies4) Octopus - wow, hot and spicy with a combo of tastes that just made me happyWhat not to have: skip the guava cocktail and head straight for the Lebanese wine, pairs better with dinner My only \"complaint\" is that they  ran out of backlava. I guess I'll have to come back :)",
      "Thank you for the lovely review and beautiful photos.",
      "Middle eastern food is perhaps one of my favorites.  I love it and jump at any chance to try a new restaurant serving this type of cuisine. So when a Lebanese friend of mine suggested we try it together last week, I was excited.  Here are my impressions. THE GOOD - The ambience. The restaurant is beautifully decorated.  It is bright and sunny. Lots of tropical plants create a calming atmosphere. - The presentation. The food is presented very well. I loved how the baba gnoush and the kibbeh looked on their serving platters.THE MEH - The service was ok. Nothing great. - The flavor. The kibbeh and baba gnoush were good.  The hummus was ok. The chicken and lamb kabobs I got were a little dry and the portions were tiny. For what they cost, I would have anticipated slightly more. THE BAD- I was surprised to see lamb was not prominently featured throughout the menu as this is an essential part of middle eastern cuisine.  You can get lamb chops (which are perhaps too large) or a skewer of ground lamb as part of another dish, but that lamb doesn't stand on its own. - The prices. The prices were typical of Miami. Inflated for what you get. The price and value were misaligned. TL; DR I was underwhelmed by Amal.  It relies too much on the superficial and not enough on the substance.  My Lebanese friend had a similar view. Amal would probably be fine if you don't have a well developed palate for middle eastern cuisine.  If you do, you're going to be underwhelmed.  If you care more about portion size, flavor, and high value for your money, I would suggest driving a little farther south to visit Shaddai Fine Lebanese cuisine as an alternative to Amal.",
      "Thank you for the review. We appreciate the feedback!",
      "Getting reservations here is on the cusp of annoying. Once you enter, the hostess is friendly and yet curt. Ambiance is very intimate and classy - I really like it. They accommodated a seating change while being a bit fussy at first despite the restaurant far from full. Wine menu robust, and they have a friendly sommelier who physically hovered a bit closer than my comfort. I enjoyed the trio start, top two: muharrara (outstanding) and hummus (better than average). I felt this was tastier and presented nicer than expected. I did not like the two pita offerings though, despite one slightly better than the other. The lamb chops were excellent -  quality, temperature, and spicing. Zero regrets here, I would order again. The date cake was also something better than expected and on the uniquer side. They were flexible with a sorbet vs ice cream request due to dairy issue and it tasted very good. My main quip is the service being a bit stuffy (even?) for a classy spot and the reservation experience (yes I think this does matter even for popular spots, which I think this is over embellishing). If the service was warmer and nice seating more accessible, it would be a far more inviting spot. I'd go back again on a right occasion, namely on a higher end authentic Mediterranean meal or on the whim at the bar. On my own, I likely wouldn't rush back. It's not bad - I just prefer more inviting service.",
      "Beautiful interior. Very elegant. Intimate, moody lighting. This trip was a great preview for a future visit. Grabbed cocktails at the bar, which was clean. Our bartender was friendly, but a little slow to pay us attention at the beginning. Out of the two beverages ordered: the grove with a beautiful \"edible orchid\" ($18 - did not eat the orchid) was good and the espresso martini ($24) was rated mediocre. Still, I had a good time and enjoyed the cozy setting a lot. The food smelled amazing, and the place looked well managed. I'll definitely be back for the full experience soon.",
      "My friend's were in town for the holidays, visiting from the Northeast, so I decided on Amal for drinks & snacks. We went straight up to the rooftop and let me tell you, the views do not disappoint. Gorgeous! The three of us found space at the bar and sat for a few hours and chatted. The service was impeccable and the bar manager was very attentive to all our wants/needs. Great drinks, great bar bites and great service. I will definitely be coming back to Amal soon.",
      "Amal is a revelation of culinary purity and strength, strength and culinary purity. A brilliant, Lebanese restaurant in Coconut Grove breathes fire and desire with a tantalizing array of course dishes that will heighten your senses and sharpen your tongue to where everything else will pale in comparison from here to kingdom come. I was unsure what to expect when I made my way to the glory that is Amal on Main Highway. My boss had reservations for the 18 of us, split between two tables, for an evening of intimate dining based on the low-lit ambiance, which was quite lovely and full of allure. Between the ambiance and the cuisine, I can see why people are a fan, such as my boss. The food is magical and scrumptious.The bottles of white and red wine my boss ordered for everyone were excellent and nicely complemented the dishes we enjoyed. Additionally, I ordered the Magenta, a nectarous blast of Tanqueray 10, ginger and lemon juices, lavender syrup, butterfly pea powder, Kensington aromatic bitters, and Fever Tree sparkling water. While not as sparkling as I anticipated, it was an exquisite gin-based cocktail that brought me to the appropriate place of comfort and clarity before the constant delivery of tapas and dishes began. And when I say the delivery of dishes was constant, I mean it. I'm sure we enjoyed half of the menu. We had the privilege of enjoying four courses worth of enticing eats that sent our palate into the stratosphere of culinary wonderment and wonder. The grape leaves and marinated olives were good starting items that allowed us to enjoy some light and citrus-brushed treats that turned our tongues and readied us for the first courses. The Mezze Sampler was quite the sample of baba ghanoush, hummus, and muhammara that was glorious with warm pita bread served. Between that and the Amal's Hummus, comprised of this glorious sauteed beef surrounded by more hummus, brought me to a place where I knew every dish would be glorious and good, good and glorious. Word to the wise; however, you want to ensure you don't fill up on hummus and bread because you will find yourself unable to eat anything else afterward.  My favorite dishes from the first and second courses remained the Truffle Rakakat and the Octopus. The former consisted of a crispy fried shell drizzled with honey and a flavor explosion when combined with a slice of grape when you took a bite. The octopus was truly heavenly and full of hellacious happiness as that was cooked to perfection and served with turmeric potato, charred onions, and a delicious pepper relish... Perfection.I feel like I should say that again... Perfection. The Nabulsi Salad with solid -- I specifically enjoyed the avocado as it embraced me as its friend. The Makanek consisted of savory house-made beef sausages, with pomegranate molasses, and lingered on my palate. The Falafel was breaded and fried terrifically, as well as quite filling. The Roasted Cauliflower was cooked well, but I found the green tahini to be a tad too citrusy. With the third course, we received a gorgeous skewer platter that consisted of pistachio kababs, chicken tawok, beef tenderloin, and tiger shrimp; all served with this creamy, delish garlic sauce and some green sauce that, while I couldn't quite pinpoint the flavor was certainly savory. But the garlic sauce was divine to the number nine, especially when you combined it with either the beef tenderloin or tiger shrimp. My mouth was a place of titillating tantalization from the explosion of culinary completeness of the dishes the Amal servers provided throughout the evening. I had a bite of the Mistkeh ice cream, creamy and nutty, thanks partly to the pistachio encrustation. The cotton candy served on top looked more like shavings of halva than some cloud-like concoction that you would find at a county fair -- but I found it very good. I was giddy but full. I was surprised I didn't have to be wheelbarrowed to the curb following the meal's ultimate conclusion. There was so much goodness to be had, but this was not my first rodeo. I assured myself at the beginning that I would take small portions so I could enjoy the full sampling of the evening's meal without descending into a pure food coma from which there may be no return.  The exquisite food was the exemplary service that was bar none, some of the best I have experienced, especially for a large party that we had. Our wine and water glasses were constantly filled, and they ensured we had everything we needed, from utensils to napkins to whether we needed our plates cleared once it looked like we had finished one of the courses of dishes we had eaten. They were there without being overly there in a Chevy Belair. It was as if they knew when we were ready to have our plates cleared or if we needed something in particular. I wouldn't go as far as to say psychic, but the servers at Amal were excellent. Amal should be on your list to embark on a culinary journey.",
      "Thank you for the positive review. We appreciate your detailed positive feedback and we cannot wait to welcome you back soon.",
      "I came here for dinner with the fam and it did not disappoint! The interior is so cute and trendy with every table having different options of seating. The space was very open with high ceilings and large glass doors that they opened up later in the night. I started with the guava slay, but replaced the reposado with Tito's. It was delicious! We then moved onto a Lebanese red wine. The service was very good. The wait staff was always ready to take our order and when we were ready to order wine, the sommelier came to our table immediately. This is what we ordered:-baba ganoush -truffle rakakat-Amal's hummus -lamb chops-tiger shrimps-date cake All of the dishes were very tasty and had a nice sauce - I love a good sauce! You have to order the garlic hot sauce on the side. Every dish came on a beautiful plate and even the plates that were served for eating on were so nice with elegant designs. Everyone said we needed to order the date cake, so we did and it was delicious, of course. Definitely recommend for anyone who's looking for a nice dinner spot.",

      "I thought the service was really good and the waiter was helpful in helping us pick our drinks and appetizer. I really enjoyed the lamb and usually do not like lamb. The plates were really big and filling. It's pricey but i thought it was really good. I had the watermelon cocktail they have and I really loved it",
      "Mandolin is truly unique among many great restaurants in Miami. The combination of a cozy ambience, cute decor, and amazing food makes it one of my favorite. The majority of seating is outside although they have a couple tables inside. Ordered a few small plates to share: Turkish sampler, pita (have to order separately), ali nazik, and spanakopitaOur favorite was the the ali nazik! Lamb was tender and full of flavor. Perfect to eat on its own or pair with pita or the house bread. The samplers were so fresh and light we ate all of it. First time trying spanakopita, cheesy flaky delight. Service was good and we got seated in about 30min without reservations on Friday night but highly recommend making reservations especially if you prefer outside seating -- gets very busy.",
      "The staff was very polite. I think I just need to try different things on the menu next time than what I ordered. I got the shrimp and the arugula salad. It was good but it wasn't what I was expecting for the price. First time I actually felt inclined to eat shrimp heads though. Great experience (wink) The pomegranate salad dressing for the arugula salad is magical and the dates are of great quality. The blend of the salad was eccentric but a bit too tart. I think my main complaint is how expensive those shrimp are lol and the quantity. I feel 10 shrimp total is fair (smiling ) It's the Virgo in me. I'm excited to try the Manti and octopus next time. Willing to give it another try. Also, I would've loved to have had some butter or olive oil to go with the bread that I got for my to go order. It was kind of dry. The place wasn't bad but it didn't awe me, maybe next time. I love the decor and design of the restaurant, it's beautiful. Felt good after my meal so that's all that mattersUpdated review after trying the Manti. So it's delicious. The to go portion, which actually they don't do to go but because I ordered previously and they didn't have it in stock they allowed the courtesy, but the to go portion is very small but again they don't even offer that as a service, so it is what it is.All in all it's good but I feel overpriced.",
      "This is such a cute place during lunch but a very relaxing vibe at night time with the gas lanterns and open roof. The food is familiar when you think of Greek food and tastes great. The octopus is tender but depend on what you prefer, it could be too tender. Its gently grilled and served with a slice of lemon. Mussels is great and their broth was perfect with the bread. The sea bass is tasted fresh but please be mindful of the little bones from eating a whole fish. Beef souvlaki was tender and a perfect meal for those that are looking for a meat and potatoes (served with fries). Get lucky and you may be able to walk in but check on Resy first for a reservation if possible. TIP: Miami traffic is as you expect - terrible - so if you have a reservation then leave earlier than expected because you will also need to find parking as street parking is not ample.",
      "One of the best spots in Miami hands down. I loved the vibe and food at Mandolin, and the service here is great as well. It's an outdoor spot, with a small indoor seating area. The food is so fresh and delicious, I was obsessed with all the things I tried. I highly recommend getting a pitcher of white sangria for your table, and just keep refilling it. For appetizers we got the stuffed zucchini, baked feta, and had the bread keep on coming, absolutely wonderful. We also loved the calamari, it was some of the best I have triedYou cannot go wrong with anything, and they have options for vegans, vegetarians, etc. I recommend getting a few appetizers to share with everyoneI really enjoyed the manti dumplings, it was similar to gnocchi and in a greek yogurt sauce with aleppo pepper. Absolutely wonderful and tangy, and rich. I got this with a side of the sautéed spinach which I recommendI finished it off with a greek frappe which was absolutely delicious! Don't forget to check out the gift shop inside, they have some wonderful candles, books, cookware, and more.",
      "Mandolin is the cutest little spot with its own fabulous flare!  Ohhh do I love it!  It's in an enclosed outdoor garden/patio type space ... the vibe is so cool.  They have this incredible red/ dark pink unsweetened pink lemonade (swoon).  The salads are just wonderful.  They have a honey pie (possibly honey pot pie?) that is one of the greatest desserts I've ever tasted. Oh and the service here is impeccable!  I mean A+++!  You will not regret a giving this place a try!",
      "The only drawback is that they are TOO popular! Tried for lunchtime reservation--had to take 3:30. But it was worth the wait. The service was excellent, the food was delicious, and the country bistro ambience was spot on. Don't miss out on the dish with the little dumplings.",
      "Came here for a late lunch for my boyfriends birthday, and it was fantastic! He loves Mediterranean food and so do I. We had reservations and managed to sit inside since the patio area was crowded and the rain was on and off. Megahn our waiter was fantastic she knew the menu inside out and recommended her favorites which let me tell you did not disappoint. We started off with drinks, the white sangria was highly recommended based on the reviews below, but to me it was very watered down. So we went with a wine she recommended which was great and paired well with our meal the name of the wine was domaine skouras 'Zoe' it was delicious. Our waiter suggested we tried more of the mezes so we could try a variety instead of having a main. So here's the list of what we ordered. - Grilled Octopus = 10/10 highly recommend was nice and tender/ charred- Cheese Saganaki= 10/10 they do it right -Greek Village Salad = 10/10 - Ali Nazik = ( ground lamb over smoked eggplant yogurt) 100/100 this was divine so delicious - Manti Dumplings = 9/10 it's a very rich sauce yet very delicious There's always room for dessert so we went with the honey pie. OMG it was the best piece of pie I've ever had. The hype is real, I get why it takes a while to get a reservation. Do yourself the favor and go there as soon as possible.",
      "Second time here for lunch, and very pleased with the consistency of the food, service, and ambience. We came on a whim on a Saturday afternoon after walking over from the Design District, and after a 25 minute wait we were seated inside. Mind you, the place was packed for a 3pm meal, so we were grateful to be able to nab a seat at all, although I would highly recommend sitting outside if you can! We ordered a mixed Greek and Turkish sampler with extra pita, followed by a rich Moussaka, and topped the meal off with two special house desserts (a sticky fragrant pistachio baklava and creamy delightful honey pie with fresh sweet cream and strawberries). Recommend checking out the wine menu to pair for an elevated Mediterranean meal. Only thing is the price, which I feel is also elevated (a bit out of proportion), but overall worth it for the pleasant atmosphere. Wonderful venue to have a casual sit down with friends and family, and very close to the Design District for a nice sit down meal in between shopping!",

      "We were in Miami for one night and were able to easily secure a reservation. By the end of the dinner, we were massive fans. Everything was perfect. First of all, the restaurant itself is absolutely beautiful. It doesn't look like much from the outside but the lush greenery and the cozy wine room area are done so well. It's inviting and warm and most all, spotless. The food was nuts. We have the crispy octopus with guacamole, the shrimp aguachiles, and the barramundi. If I could bottle the aguachiles sauce and keep it on me at all times I would.  The barramundi was perfectly crispy and that sauce was incredible too. Their house Merlot (I think it was the Merlot but not sure) was delicious. Not too strong and clearly amazing quality. Finally, the service - our hostess could not have been sweeter. We were half an hour early for our reservation and if she minded she didn't show it. I didn't catch her name unfortunately. Luis was the best waiter we've had in months; he was attentive but not overbearing and was happy to chat about the food as much as we were.  We were on vacation for 8 more days after this dinner but we mentioned it nearly daily. It was that good.",
      "We went here for dinner on a Saturday evening. There is a paid parking lot right across the street from the restaurant, but it has a minimum reservation time of 6 hours for $30! There is no street parking outside of the restaurant. Uber would have been a better bet.The restaurant itself is beautiful and the service was pretty good. But the food was average at best and absolutely not worth the price. The $30 tacos (?!) were underseasoned and soggy. That was about par for the course for every dish we tried. Plan to order 2-3 entrees per person; they are small plates. This restaurant is beer and wine only. The two \"cocktails\" are beer or wine based.If MORLA cut their prices by about 50% we might give it another shot. As it is, we won't be back.ETA: The business owner was kind enough to remind me that the three soggy, underseasoned fish tacos were actually $23 not $30. Including tax and tip, that would come to about $30.36 for aforementioned tacos. I'm sorry--my mistake!",
      "Hi Jualia’s !!! Sorry to hear that!! Regarding our Baja fish tacos they are one the most popular and is the first time that we receive a regular comment for them since they are well seasoned and have 3 types of salsa. And dressings over them!!! the price of theme are $23 Not $30 like you mention!! We use prime fresh and healthy quality products in all our menu and definitely our prices won’t be lower. Thank you !!!",
      "The minute you enter the nondescript door in downtown Miami you're immersed into a world of sensory delight and that's before you've had your first bite of food.  You're greeted warmly like a treasured friend arriving for a long overdue visit. The decor is imbued with old world charm in muted colors and the sigh of relief and the smile on your face come unbidden. I'm always skeptical when food looks so good it could hang in a museum but Morla delivers to your palate in equal measure.  All the dishes we tried were an absolute explosion of flavor and creativity.We started with the Nikkei Tuna Ceviche, impossibly fresh and elevated by the amarillo leche de tigre to the divine. The sesame oil was applied with a deft touch, providing a delicate hint of the sesame while still allowing the tuna center stage.The Filet Mignon Anticucho was expertly seasoned and cooked to temperature perfection, lightly seared on the outside, bright pink in the middle. The delicate potatoes served along side were a delightful surprise, light and fluffy and complimented perfectly with the sauces. Do not skip the sauces. They are masterful concoctions of flavor and spice.The Baja Fish Tacos set the standard for what every fish taco should aspire to be...I didn't even know you could get such a thin layer of breading so crunchy yet still retain the moistness of the fish. The Crema Volteada was a perfect ending to the meal, light and creamy and just the right side of sweetness.The only drawback for me was the lack of a full bar (they're working on it) but the Pisco Sour I had was excellent and Sharon indulged my request to take a video of the smoke billowing out of the dome topped creation. It hit the perfect balance point of sweet/tart and was FUN!Morla deserves to be the #1 restaurant in all Miami. It's perfect. The food, the service, and the ambiance combine to wrap you in a bubble of all that is good in the world for as long as you're there (and these days we certainly need it). Go to celebrate a special occassion or to spend time with people you value, go to cheer yourself up, or go for a romanitc date, but GO. NOW.PS Yes, it's pricey but worth every penny.",
      "Madeline !! We thank you very much for your review and appreciation for our effort and work for you and all our customers. We invite you to try something different next time.  Have a great weekend and thank you again. Best regards MORLA TEAM",
      "Mind blown! I had not been to this place for a while, then WOW! Amazing taste, presentation, service and ambience. Had some fish with the green sauce, anticuchos and garlic mushrooms. Love this place and its ambience.",
      "A couple of friends invited us to try Morla Restaurant which opened downtown Miami about 8 months ago, they had been there a few times and loved it so we went together and ................. OMG what a great discovery, absolutely amazing !!!!! Thank you Skip and Laurie The place is gorgeous inside and outside there is a little patio for outdoor eating, really beautiful Ruben the owner and chef greeted us and cooked for us an incredible dinner with his modern creative dishes, we had Nikkei Salmon Ceviche, Filet Mignon Anticucho, Wood Fire Octopus, Pear Pasta, Branzino Tiradito, Branzino Griliado and Miso Salmon, everything was just incredible, the chef's passion came thru each dish which was an explosion of different flavors that just made each and every dish just perfect I highly recommend it and I will be back very soon @morla_restaurant",
      "Amazing food and amazing vibe. Great for date night or group dinners. Recommend the branzino tiradito and any of their ceviches. Also, the pear pasta!",
      "Was in Brickell visiting a friend and wanted to grab something to eat, so of course I go to my trusty Yelp for recommendations. This place popped up with 5 stars so I had to check it out.First of all, hello! This place is sooooo cute!! My friend and I felt transported to somewhere, definitely not Miami, and it was nice to feel like we were on vacation for a little while.This place is perfect for a romantic date or for anything really.  The food was great, it's tapas style and meant for sharing but portions are good enough for two and very reasonably priced. Especially because the menu is so special and creative.We shared the octopus with avocado as well as the pasta dish with pear, cheese and passion fruit cream. So so good!Definitely a new fave in this part of town.",
      "So, despite being on a slightly sketchy street in downtown across from a slingshot rental parking lot, the interior of morla is quite cute and you forget about the shady characters that might be lingering outside.  The food is alllll delicious but portions are a bit small so prepare to sample many items.  I highly recommend the fish tacos. Sadly there was no Lucuma or pisco sours but they did carry some good beers and a tasty choc cake.  Would recommend for an intimate date night!",
      "This restaurant is a little \"hole in the wall.\" It was slightly hard to find (I'm directionally impaired), but definitely worth finding. We came here for a pre-cruise family dinner. The dishes are definitely small, and for the amount of people we had, the meal ended up being very pricy. That said, the flavor was excellent, and the service amazing. Definitely worth checking out. Two thumbs up. Super sweet staff.",
      "What a wonderful find! You wouldn't think it from the outside, but the restaurant is beautifully decorated and such a nice vibe inside. Our server was great, fast and efficient. They do not have a very extensive menu, but everything we tried was fantastic. They don't have a liquor license, and the wine list was pretty small (1 bottle per varietal), but the malbec we tried was great. The food is tapas style, with most of the plates being good for 3 or 4 people to taste. The pear pasta was good, but the passion fruit sauce was a bit too much with the pear flavor. Highly recommend: filet mignon anticucho, octopus, fish tacos"

      "Seaspice was amazing. It's a fantastic restaurant with a great view right on the Miami River. If you don't right you can catch the live music as the sun sets, and the restaurant transforms to a lounge. Totally worth coming Parking is tricky, and if you're not paying attention you might miss it as you drive by. But it's a gem worth coming back to.",
      "Seaspice is known to Miami locals as a very high end resturant, frequented by celebrities.  I have no idea why.  The service is pretty awful.  The drink runners are horrible.  It takes about 30 minutes for just a drink to be brought out to you.  The food is mediocre.  It is definitely NOT worth the price, which is very expensive.  I am giving two stars because the view is amazing.  Seaspice is right on the water and has a gorgeous ambiance.  You can watch yachts drive by and some will even pull up and park.  The other star is for the tres leches.  This dessert was AMAZING, I would go back just to eat it again.  But otherwise, Seaspice is nothing special.  Save your money.",
      "A place that tries to be high end but fails to deliver.Service ? Mediocre Food ? Below parFirst thing when you check in is they tell you that you have a 2 hr max(tacky)",
      "I read this was one of the best patio dining AND a hot spot for celebrities in Miami, so I had to go check it out on our recent travels to this area...Initially I was worried about our luggage situation, as we had to carry our luggage to the restaurant since this was our last stop in Miami. However, they were very accommodating, and let us store some of our stuff in the closet, and we kept the big luggage with us, near our table.As expected, the patio scene was spectacular...city skyline and seaside views, with plenty of yachts passing by! The place indeed had that chic celebrity vibe...truly FAB! Loved the music overhead as well. Somehow, I expected some snobbiness...but not at all. Service was great!Then the food. OMFG...I've had some amazing foods lately, but this takes the cake. Even the complimentary bread was amazing (and unique)! My husband ordered this Wagyu Burger, and I chose this Ragu Pappardelle ( THE best Ragu Pappardelle I've ever had...EVER. ). Then this Pavola dessert...again, just beyond delish. Truly, this was foods for the celebrities.Honestly, I'm shocked at how low the rating is for this place. I assume that if the service isn't top notch, it would probably piss some folks off. The pricing was on the outlandish side...with even lunch entrees starting at around 40. There was even an appetizer item priced at around 70 bucks! Luckily, like I said, I felt that the foods and the service (and especially the spectacular ambiance) made up for it. There was this big yacht parked right near us, which somewhat blocked some of the views from the left. Still, we got our eyeful of seaside/yachtside views.In any case, this was a great way to end our trip in Miami.",
      "Went here with a group of girlfriends for brunch and everything was delicious, they were super accommodating as well.I had the froze , a cucumber and gin cocktail and 2 grey goose and sodas and all were fantastic.As a table we split the fresh fish and a couple sides and it was delicious. Also love the free bread It is definitely on the pricier side overall tbh but great for a fun \"fancy\" brunch",
      "Came here for Miami spice and although we spent more than we thought we would, we had a good time. Everything was delicious. The kale Caesar had pecans and Granny Smith apple slices, never had a Caesar like this but it was a nice change! The Shrimp Pesto Whole Wheat Spaghetti was my favorite, even though I'm not the biggest fan of pesto. The burger was good too just a little messy from the truffle aioli. The chocolate cremoso and tres leches was very good but I'd go with the cremoso for the cocoa nib crumble, yum! All in all, I think it's overpriced and I probably won't come here again because of that. The cheapest bottle of Chardonnay was $75 and most drinks were $20. I only came here for Miami spice and still spent almost $200.",
      "Given we still have Miami Spice going on until the end of the month we decided to try out the lunch menu @ Seaspice gorgeous location on the Miami River, sitting outdoor is really relaxing, so beautiful to watch the boats go by, really lovely To start we had the Comte' Cheese Soufflé, I have to admit this was a bit disappointing, it really did not have the texture of a real soufflé  but then............ the Shrimp Pesto Whole Wheat Spaghetti and the Pan-Seared Chilean Seabass were really good as dessert, both the Tres Leches and the Chocolate Cremoso were yummy Try it out before Miami Spice ends, you can check out the Miami Spice Menus on miamiandthebeaches.com@seaspicemia",
      "First time for me at Seaspice, it is located on the banks of the Miami River it is a gem that you should not miss. Sit outside in the courtyard enjoy your food and a drinks while watching the boats go by, just beautiful We had the Miami Spice lunch which has a very affordable fix price 3 course menu for $ 28, unfortunately this will end soon, nevertheless, I would defiantly go back again for sureRegarding the Miami Spice menu only one observation, they should have had more than one choice for the Entrees without the extra charge, right now you have 4 choices and 3 of these have extra charge on it, not really fair given that you are promoting the Spice menu, you should have at least two or three choices included in the price and one or two with the extra charge We had had Prince Edward Island Mussels, Grilled, the Grilled Faroe Island Salmon and the Profiteroles and Peaches and Cream. My favorite where the Mussels, the garlic pizza bread they brought for the table was absolutely delicious, the Salmon was good too. I had the Peaches for dessert and it was ok, not really my thing, my friend said the Profiteroles were great, next time I will not opt for the healthy dessert We enjoyed all with a good Albariño wine, our experience was made especially enjoyable by our waiter Fabrizio, he was really great ! Thank you Fabrizio @seaspicemia",
      "Bad first impression. Its not a nice feeling to feel like you have to beg to spend your money at a restaurant. Every year I look forward to Miami Spice. It's a great way to try out various restaurants and a unique spread of menu options. Seaspice was on my radar and happened to be one of the participating restaurants offering the Miami Spice menu. I contacted the restaurant in advance and made a reservation for 3:30p for a party of four. My mom who is from out of town was excited to join us for lunch. I advised the restaurant we were doing the Miami Spice menu. The restaurant made it clear that they charge $50pp for No Shows. At 3:15pm, we arrived for our reservation. The hostess Karin greeted us, and advised us that they were running behind on the reservations and because of this they will not be able to offer the Miami Spice menu. Only the a la-carte menu will be offered. This was a bit upsetting because we drove almost an hour to get there and the restaurant is refusing to offer the Miami Spice promotion. Our natural instinct was to just say forget it we will go somewhere else. I mean, at the end of the day who wants to beg to spend their money? It's absurd. If the restaurant is offering a promotional menu and because to no fault of our own they are running behind why should we be penalized?My Mom looked so bummed out. Because she was so excited to try this place. I decided to walk back in and ask for a Manager. The Manager took 20min to come out. When he finally did come over, he introduced himself as Collin. I explained to him what was going on and it seemed as though he wasn't aware that the hostesses were turning Miami Spice customers away. He decided to make it right and advised Karin to honor the Miami Spice menu. Impressive! Things were turning around. Besides the encounter at the hostess stand, the restaurant is beautiful. It is situated on Miami's waterfront were you can view the million dollar yachts passing by. They also have docks for those interested in docking and dining. You can view the downtown city skyline which I am sure looks amazing at night.The food was excellent. The Miami Spice menu offered a three course lunch for $28. You have the choice of a starter (Kale Salad, Cheese Souffle, or White Gazpacho). A choice of entrees (Seabass, Chicken Breast, Shrimp Pesto Pasta, Wagyu Burger, or Plant Bowl). And a choice of dessert (Tres Leches or Chocolate Cremoso). They also offer the option to add a Glass of wine for and additional $12. I ordered the Comte Cheese Souffle, the Green Circle Farms Chicken Breast, and the Tres Leches. The others in my party ordered the Kale Salad, Gazpacho, and Seabass. For starters, My favorites were the Kale Caesar Salad and Cheese Souffle. The Kale Caesar had a mix of shredded Granny Smith apples, pecans and a creamy Caesar dressing. The cheese Souffle was like a fluffy egg Souffle with a cream parmesan sauce and tomato chutney. Delicious!For entrees, both the Seabass and Chicken breast were amazing. The Chicken breast was tender and juicy, served on top of a creamy polenta and topped with corn, peas, and mushrooms. The seabass was seared nicely to give a nice crunch on the outside, while perfectly flaky and moist on the inside. It was served with stewed garbanzo, Swiss chard, and smoked potato. For desserts, we all had Tres Leches. It was served in a small Mason jar topped with 3 milks, and berries. Perfect way to end the meal. The portions are not large but it is filling. The flavors are fresh and very well balanced. The food presentation was notable. The Watermelon Tequila drink was delightful and refreshing. The froze was also a big hit. The cocktails were presented well and created perfectly. We enjoyed everything. Our waiter, Austin was very friendly. He made great recommendations and was very attentive.An 18% gratuity was added to the tab. There are lots of street parking accessible. In the end, the food was great. Ambience was amazing. The hostesses can use additional customer service training and learn to use better judgment to improve the customers experience. There was no need to escalate the matters to a manager. It could have been handled properly by showing empathy, apologizing, and finding a solution to the problem.",
      "Hi Kim,Thank you for dining with us and leaving a detailed review. It has been forwarded to our management team. Our apologies for the confusion at the door.  Glad to hear Collin accommodated you and your experience was turned around.  We are happy to see your great feedback regarding the food, cocktails, and Austin’s Service.  Hopefully you will join us again in the near future!",
      "This is my second time going to sea spice & I normally love it as the first time. I never leave bad reviews But this second time MY PHONE WAS STOLEN AND SECURITIES DID NOThing about it. Instead we're trying to blame me for the situation. I'm not drunk nor was drunk. I walked in with 2 phone and walked out with 1.We came as my friend USUALLY does and this is how they treated us  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME. I thought it was 5 star so nothing could go wrong. With a security right next to our table my phone STILLL got stolen. It was on the table. And to whoever has the time to steal phones is just sad imagine what else they can steal... I wil ask to review cameras but with the way I was treated when I let them know I lost my phone I doubt they will be helpful but I'll let every platform form of review know that they steal phones here. I know the exact time frame as well so they wouldn't even have to look much at the cameras. Let's see. BTW I BEEN HOME SICK AFTER EATING THESE OYSTERS I COULDNT Even celebrate my baby's birthday w him.",
      "Came here for my birthday dinner with my boyfriend for a 7:15 reservation (we called in advance for an outdoor seat dock side) we waited about ten minutes after our arrival for our table to be ready at the bar, the short wait was definitely worth it. Started with an aperol spritz at the bar then ordered octopus and gazpacho to start. Octopus portion was good but the olive oil tasted burnt since it came out on a sizzling hot cast iron looking skillet (its very easy to overcook octopus, please just bring a regular plate next time.) I also had the whole main lobster. Extremely delicious large portion of perfectly cooked and seasoned lobster, bravo. My boyfriend had the truffle coated Chilean sea bass and he absolutely loved it. Vibe: 5/5 this place definitely is a scene but not overwhelmingly pretentious or obnoxious. Absolutely loved the music as well. Service:3/5 A bit slow, our server was very attentive when we were able to get his attention but we had to always wave him down. Food: 4/5 everything was honestly pretty good (octopus could've had a bit more attention to detail)",
      "Hi Liz,Thank you for celebrating your birthday with us!  We are so happy to hear you had a great experience and enjoyed the food.  Your feedback regarding the octopus has been sent to our chef. We look forward to seeing you again soon!"

      "Hands down my favorite restaurant in Miami. Ambiance is upbeat and intimate. Food is AMAZING does not miss in the year I've been going consistently. Service is outstanding .",
      "Amazing steakhouse Our favorite was the the Australian Wagyu which I can only say was perfection. their sides were so perfectly complimentary. Truffle Mac and cheese, the Brussels sprouts, spinach, broccolini and cauliflower were excellent. Beef lettuce wraps were decent, beet salad was good, kids meals were devoured. ALSO if you're here for breakfast their buffet is great",
      "WOW - To say I was completely blown away by my first time dining here would be an understatement. Whether you're celebrating a special occasion or just craving a delectable meal that will leave you speechless, this is the spot that will be sure to leave a lasting impression. From the lavish and trendy decor, the out of this world dishes, beautiful presentations and impeccable service, every detail was taken well into consideration and perfected.I can say with certainty that this is one of the most gorgeous spaces I've ever eaten a meal in. The sultry vibe, elegantly designed interior, endless display of wine bottles scattered throughout the restaurant and the stunning bar will have you feeling like you're in the midst of dining amongst celebrities. There didn't seem to be a bad table to dine at in sight, but my parents and I were lucky enough to snag one of the beautiful half-moon booths toward the center of the room. When is the last time you've been to a restaurant that brings complimentary French fries to the table? And not just any regular ole' French fries, but a delicious trio of French fries each complimented by their own unique dipping sauce? Bet it's probably never happened before, unless you've eaten here. I thought this was such a neat but simple touch that really set them apart from other high-end restaurants. They also bring yummy rolls topped with sea salt to the table (between the fries & the bread, you might end up in a food coma before you even order if you're not careful). I ordered the tuna tartar for an appetizer and I was in heaven every time I took a bite. Not only does it melt in your mouth, but the presentation alone is enough reason to order this (the way they mix it for you makes for a fun video opportunity if you have your phone ready to record). My parents shared a shrimp cocktail that they both enjoyed - The shrimp were massive! Following the appetizers, I munched on a cesar salad which was perfectly dressed. Now... the STEAK. Holy moly, one of the best filet mignons I have had yet. It was ridiculously flavorful, tender & juicy. Melted in your mouth and bursted with flavor. If you're a steak lover, it would be a crime to come here and not order it. The mashed potatoes that accompanied it were also flavorful, but I thought they were a little too runny (my only complaint of the whole meal). If you're a fan of grilled onions, do yourself a favor and order a side of these to top your steak with and thank me later. The \"Smoked Chocolate S'mores\" dessert was ridiculously decadent and was the perfect finish to an impeccable meal. Yes, it's insanely pricy and yes, it's totally worth it. My experience here was one of the best dining experiences I've ever had in Miami - And that says a lot given the fact that Miami is one of the hottest spots in the country for foodies. This restaurant hit it out the park for me and I'm already searching for an excuse to go back to South Florida and to savor new dishes on their menu.",
      "The restaurant is spacious and nice. Bar is nice as well.Staff was friendly and attentive.For appetizers the tuna tartare was fresh and seasoned well.They also bring you French fries 3 different ways with 3 different sauces. I had the certified Angus rib cap cooked medium rare and It was good and flavorful. The side of Mac and Cheese was good as well.",
      "Our favorite was the the Australian Wagyu which I can only say was perfection.",
      "Ambiance was awesome. The dishes, coctails and the dessert were so delicious. All the employees were so polite and friendly. They celebrated our honeymoon with a cute card, it was so nice.They made our special day unforgettable.",
      "Wonderful experience! Fabulous service. Timing, everything was a 10.  Our server really made our night fabulous, she was awesome. Great steak, Mac and cheese with truffle was really nice. Molten cake was super good as well. I must say everything was impeccable.",
      "Phenomenal cuisine. Never have a enjoyed such a succulent and flavourful sea bass - it is one of their renowned specials. But the lack of bones in the fish was made up for by the pained bones in my rear.The decor was beautiful but very far from comfortable. The low chairs were too uncomfortable for eating. The benches; built for slaves.The overall experience was truly hampered by a god awful designer deserving of life in prison for her domestic terror on comfort. 4/5 not bad",
      "This plus is amazing! We had a private room & our server was Erin. Erin was very pleasant, patient, informative & very professional. She suggested several appetizers & dinner. It was our first time visiting this restaurant & it definitely won't be our last.",
      "Food was incredible. I love that when you get to the table instead of getting some bread you get french fries. Service was also impeccable and ambiance is very family friendly in my opinion"

If you love Indian food... this is the place for you.   If you aren't familiar with Indian food... this is the place for you to learn.  The staff is great at making suggestions... Varun was our waiter last night and he was great.  Very attentive.  Spot on with his recommendations.  Very friendly and competent.  The food was delicious.  We had three different entrees... two appetizers and dessert.  The portions were a good size and quality ingredients.   Very large vegetarian options too. Wine selection is kinda limited... I plan to bring my own next time and pay a corkage fee.  Our plan is to keep coming back and try all of the entrees.  Highly recommend Indian Spice.",
      "Solid India food and  knowledgeable staff...  definitely worth a visit. The food scene on 79th street from Collins to Biscayne Blvd is really coming alive... worth a trip for casual Foodies.",
      "I previously gave four stars and compliments to this restaurant. However it was many months before we could make it back here, and I am afraid the entire experience has changed, making me wonder if ownership or management is new... the samosas were half the size, the Tikka Masala was a deep red color and tasted EXACTLY like Chef Boyardee Spaghettios from a can (obviously, they just spooned some tomato paste in to make more sauce and didn't even let it cook down to remove the bitterness). And worst of all, the Tandoori Chicken my friends ordered was covered in a thick grainy baste that contained a high level of something tasting like bleach.I am not one for insulting a restaurant for having a bad night, especially after I had such a great experience a few months previous. But the 100% change in food quality across the board was too alarming to let it slide this time. Obviously, nail in the coffin on this place for us. :(Go to Bombay Darbar instead. It's worth the drive to the Grove.",
      "Very sweet owners working and cooking here. Tender, super flavorful tandoori chicken! Delicious mimosas and chutney. Everything was great. This is a reliably good local spot.",
      "Had the chicken Saag which is a cream spinach based masterpiece. I normally do not go for spinach but this is not your regular plate. Varun was my waiter and he said it was the house special, so I took his suggestion and won big time.",
      "Great quality and amount per serving .  Fantastic flavors but ...It is soooooooooo spicy.  Even if you ask for the Mildest. Their \" mild\"  is too hot for the average person . After glasses and glasses of water couldnt finish it . Went home hungry. It's a shame b/c otherwise the food would be excellent. I do not know why do this,  you can always make it hotter for whomever requests it. Instead of loosing 90 % of patrons. That is where Zayka and Darbar get it right, and are always full. Indian food has so many wonderful spices why drown everything with heat instead of making it optional for you to add as much heat as you want.",
      "So Taste Buds of India is under new management and is now Indian Spice. Slightly high prices and small portions because Indian is treated like a delicacy in Miami. The food was delicious though. Service is very good. Interior is bright and clean. They also have a few tables outside in the Normandy Fountain square. They have lunch specials. I'll be back again soon.",
      "Amazing food! Friendly ambiance with a staff that makes you feel at home! Highly recommended!",
      "Super authentic and excellent service. Our server explained us the menu well and was very kind. Will come again soon.",
      "The food was alright but I really enjoyed the atmosphere. I feel like the food could have come a little quicker.",
      "Taste Buds of India..you were my all time favorite restaurant for my Indian food cravings but lately, I don't know what's going on with your food!!!I used to always get the Lamb vindaloo (Extra spicy) and kashmiri naan! Everything about them used to be perfect! The level of spice, the sweetness of the Kashmiri naan, just YUM! However, the last time I ordered from you guys, the lamb vindaloo was mainly just oil and the kashmiri naan was just alright..was a little lighter in the filling but still ok. We sometimes have a bad night so I decided to give you another chance!This time though definitely made me realize this will be the last time I ever order again from here unfortunately! I ordered a lamb tikka masala to change it up and my usual Kashmiri naan. The lamb tikka masala was a tiny portion and tasted like tomato sauce and cream mixed with little bits of meat. I have had better frozen Indian food than that! There were NO vegetables in it at all either. And the Kashmiri naan tasted like a regular naan! There was pretty much NO filling and was super unsatisfactory. So disappointing and what a waste of money :( Hope you guys can get back to the amazing quality you used to serve. But this is my goodbye",
      "Worst $50 delivery I've ever had. \"No onions\" salad loaded with onions. Lamb curry \"mild\" so spicy you could barely taste the meat. It looked like a bowl of spicy red sauce with the small pieces of meat swimming in it. Couldn't tell if it was lamb, dog, goat, with the amount of spicy sauce covering it. Definitely not much of it for the price. No other ingredients in it. Naan bread was unremarkable. On a positive note - jasmine rice was good and delivery took less than 30 min. I think it's because they just microwaved some of the leftovers from the day before, lol. Next time I'll just get a can of Dinty Moore stew from the gas station. Much cheaper and same amount of enjoyment."

They have a Thursday pasta special, and a delicious and entertained Sunday brunch. If I'm not mistaken, for $40 bucks you get to eat as much as you want, their great buffet.You can also order a perfectly roasted chicken (amongst many other dishes) to take away for under $15, and it's so freaking good. They sell cheeses and cold cuts from all over the world. Excellent place. I would Go again and again.",
      "Perricones is always a safe bet. If you want, classic Italian, this is your spot. Service is attentive. Food is always on point. I wish they brought butter or olive oil to eat with the bread. Also, fresh grated Parmesan would be nice. Something about Parmesan in little plastic containers cheapens it. The fiocchi with pear is amazing, highly recommend.",
      "My favorite Italian restaurant in Miami, and it's not even close. Perricone's has been around for over 25 years, it's a Miami staple.

The wait staff is always friendly and attentive, without being overbearing. The food is incredible, everything I've ever ordered is delicious. After trying many different Italian spots throughout Miami, two years ago I tried Perricone's and never went anywhere else. I always look forward to returning, grazie!",

The steak pasta was just beyond delicious it's our favorite pasta not too heavy not too saucy just the perfect amount of deliciousness If you're in Brickell this is a MUST. It's great for groups or just a fun date night",
      "Excellent food and excellent service!  Location wasn't great and construction all around them so it was a little difficult getting to them but at least it's away from all the crowded areas in Miami.  We let the server know that we were going to the -Marc Anthony concert sohe hurried our food along and it was delicious!  In case your wondering how the concert was it was AMAZING, Highly recommend that show also!",

The rest of the entrees looked good too.I'd definitely recommend this place for lunch or dinner.",

I'd definitely recommend this place for lunch and dinner!",
      "Being a fan of the original location and having our first date 11 years ago I decided to take my wife to the new location.  Upon walking in it is a new build marketplace looked dim and not as inviting/appetizing as the previous food marketplace we walked in to the main dining room and while it's smaller then original location the wait staff is amazing.  The food I had the North Atlantic salmon which tasted frozen and the quinoa seemed like it was microwaved my wife had the filet mignon which tasted like it was burnt.I don't foresee going back unless things improve",
      "I have been to the old location in downtown before, this is the first time I have been to the new location. I have to say it is definitely a downgrade. This new location seems not as authentic and interesting as the other one. Seems space is smaller and tables are laid out in a line mostly. The food quality does not seem the same the last time I went. Pear and Gorgonzola pasta was alright but not worth the price. The portion was whatever and kind of cold. However the Baked Brie was on point and highlyRecommend.  I wish this place had the old layout and had a store and everything now this place seems very generic."

      "Lively restaurant with live music, delicious food and great ambiance right in the middle of Little Havana, Calle Ocho, in Miami. We came Thursday night around 9pm and were seated quickly - even though we were 30 minutes late for our 8:30pm reservation! Note: I had to call a number a found on Yelp to get a resi - no online availability. From the moment we walked in, it was a fun vibe! People were standing up and dancing salsa at their seats. The singer of the band was walking around the restaurant, entertaining the crowd. On the food, The beef empanadas are a solid bet, and I played it safe with my entree and had the half chicken with side of rice and plantains. So good and honestly better than the food I had in real Havana which left a lot to be desired. Chicken was well seasoned, moist, and wasn't dry like it usually might be in some of the Cuban restaurants I've been to in NYC or Miami. I was pleasantly surprised. It was served with a purée and tomato, broccoli and potatoes. Would definitely come back!",
      "My table of four had server, Daniela G. We ordered two Cuban sandwiches and two ceviches de cojimar. The dishes were good but was nothing special. When we got our check, we were told by our server that the added on 18% service charge doesn't go to her directly but to the restaurant to pay their salaries. She was trying to swindle us out of paying more tip. The point of a tip is to cover wait staff wages which is already being paid by the service charge so I saw no point in adding more extra tip if the 18% service charge is literally for their salaries.",
      "Food is no good. Drinks all water n ice The athmosfe is nice but is better la TROVANo quality",
      "Dear Martha, we would like to know better what happened at your visit, can you please call us at 786 578 22 20, thank you",
      "A Michelada and a Cubano hit the spot for lunch today! My Lyft driver recommended this place for sandwiches and drinks and it did not disappoint. Friendly servers, live music, and seating on the street was perfect for for people watching! I'd love to come here again!",
      "A nice spot for a casual bite.  There is good music (sometimes live, but not when we were there).  The staff were friendly and the bartender was great.  We only tasted the bar snacks, but the menu looked good and the bacalao was great.",
      "Loud and fun a live band makes conversation impossible but dancing feet start tapping away. Sandwiches are good and they have a dessert that is a Bonn but must try it in a can....You sit in garish chairs amid an Ambiance is all about Hemingway and his mystique. It very Havana style. Old Havana. Oh and  their mojitos are good - another nod to that Old Man from the sea. We take our groups here where the service is good and prices reasonable.",
      "One of our favorite restaurants to visit while in Miami. We came during lunch time and they had live music, which was nice. The staff is always so welcoming and friendly. We've been for dinner in the past, but this time we came for lunch before our flight. We wanted to try the empanadas and calamari, but discovered they had a tasting menu; 3 items for $28, which included an appetizer, main course, desert and coffee. Great deal and Everything was delicious! We tried so many different items and walked away full and very satisfied.",
      "If you want the experience of eating Cuban food in Little Havana, I suppose this will suffice. But as a 30 yr resident of this town, there are far better and a million other options if GOOD food is what you are after.The ambience here was festive and loud. Music was great, service friendly but the food disappointing and very overpriced for Cuban food. My Rabo Incendido (oxtail) was super salty and tough and cost $32! You could get it for almost half that price at a neighborhood Cuban restaurant. This restaurant converts to a club starting at 11 pm.",
      "Dear Julie, we are happy that you like our drinks and we are sorry you didn't love the oxtail, we would like to make it up to you, please write us at reservations@gastronomic…",
      "We were visiting Miami for the weekend and actually discovered this place through Yelp. Great, small spot for delicious Cuban food. Our waiter was great, and the vibe of the restaurant was fun. The oysters we had were just ok, but the oxtail entree and tres leches were mouth watering!",
      "Short Wait Time 5/5Food 5/5Drinks 5/5Ambience 5/5Service 5/5Me and My Friend back in Late Sept came here to eat dinner, It was amazing. The Staff was so friendly, they had live music so it was an amazing vibe, the space is Beautiful & The Service was good. I loved the entire experience, I'II def be back!"

      "Overall: (5/5)Secret: go next door to Joe's Take Away.  There are tables and even a bar.  You order and sit and eat.  Great people watching here as all.  The locals and in-the-know tourists come here and eat at all times.  Free parking across the street for take-away.Venue: (4/5) still continues to deliver.  Think of NYC Peter Lugars or whichever NYC steak venue you love. The vibe is the same.  Great vibe, great food, not cheap prices but so worth it!!!!   I've seen all sorts of clientele: big and small groups, locals, tourists, celebrities, families...it's for everyone.  Be prepared for waiting...could be hours.Food (5/5) get the stone crab and extra mustard sauce.  Try the butter sauce but the mustard sauce always wins.  Creamed spinach is wonderful.  Key lime is unreal!  All these things are my go-tos.Service (5/5) superb",
      "Perfection and a SoBe MUST for locals and tourists.Venue: (5/5) next door to the main restaurant with tables and a bar to sit at.  Mostly locals and well informed tourists. Usually short waits for a table (first come first serve).  In my mind...what else can you ask for.Food; (5/5) Medium stone crabs (extra mustard sauce!  Key lime!!!!!Service (5/5) they have it down to a science. Tip: wine is in a separate section from the food.",
      "Excellent, excellent food. Date of Visit: January 1, 2023Ordered: 1/2 Dozen Oysters - Excellent and fresh.Sea Scallop Casserole - Favorite dish, melts in your mouth.Lobster Roll - Ton of fresh meat with excellent seasoning.Crab Cakes - Lots of meat, with excellent seasoning.Stone Crab Claws - Very fresh, and paired very well with the mustard.Lobster Casserole - Large amount of lobster. Very light, but could have used a little more seasoning.Key Lime Pie - Very light and airy, which was perfect to close out. Service was excellent and the waiter was very friendly.",
      "Many times over the years we have ordered Stone Crab from Joe's using overnight delivery. Mainly for special occasions, like New Years or birthdays. The crab is always fresh and delicious and their creamy horseradish sauce is perfect. A great treat!!This year we we traveled to Fort Collins Colorado for a wedding, with activities that extended thru the News Years weekend. To help make it a special occasion we placed an order with Joe's. Unfortunately, due to unforeseen delivery circumstances they were unable to make the delivery. Joe's immediately stepped forward without being asked, and, without trying to cast blame or responsibility onto the delivery company, accepted responsibility gave a full refund. It is my understanding that this involved over 400 orders which, I am sure had a major impact on Joe's finances.Joe's; Thank you for being a standup company and doing the right thing without being prodded! Thank you for your great product which I will not hesitate to order again. A well deserved five stars for many reasons.",
      "Oh dear, what has happened to my former icon and favorite restaurant for over 25 years?Pro- large stone crabs were fresh, delicious as always! Reservations now accepted except old habits persist that others are magically swept in ahead and seated in the front dining section. Now the depressing news..this institution has regressed into being a parody of its former self...a very expensive cafeteria in fact.Diners wearing cut off Jean's, flip flops, service non existent, just roll em in and roll em out.Hubby always enjoys the amazing fried chicken, baked potato was from 2019 so that was returned and stricken from the bill. Chopped salad was tasty , pretty darn small for a \"large\" , the small must be served in a coffee cup!Sweet potato fries tasty as expected but cold, those were returned and thankfully hot the 2nd time around. Grilled asparagus,  modified for no butter or cheese, were fine and plentiful. Desserts ridiculous at $13, no thanks.Fortunately,  we were able to find a free parking spot in the restaurant parking lot to avoid the $18 valet fee.",
      "This is my favorite restaurant in Miami for special occasions.  When the stone crabs are in season get some.  The large claws are cold and wonderful with Joe's special sauce.  I love the lobster macaroni and cheese, and the crab cakes.  Fried chicken is a great deal, and the crab cakes, and variety of fish, i.e. salmon, grouper, etc. are always wonderful.  The nicely dressed waiters with jackets give you great service, and the South Beach decor in the dining room are great for a special occasion.  I always love Joe'!",
      "I am not sure how I feel about Joe's Stone Crab House franchising out to different parts of the country.  It is the place for special occasions in Miami, Florida.  The restaurant has expanded since I was last here a few years ago.  My waiter, Carlos gave us excellent service and gave me great advice with the crab soup, and the Jumbo Stone Crabs.  Even for a Maryland boy, I cannot argue that the cold Stone Crabs here at Joe's are truly spectacular.  As usual I had my Key Lime pie!  At Joe's it is all about the food, and having a good time.  Joe's Stone Crab truly belongs amongst the great restaurants in the United States!  Would I give it all-Madden status--without question.  It is one of the few restaurants that would draw me back to a city by itself.  Oh how I do love Miami--Especially in the winter!",
      "A Miami Legend!  A Legend survives because they create a product which is different, and has high quality food.  If you are a Joe's Stone regular you understand the wait, and the setup.  If you arrive early which is what I recommend, to see the efficiency of the opening of this restaurant it is truly amazing.  I am certainly more of a Maryland Crab & Dungeness Crab person.  However, the Stone Crabs with the sauce is truly a world class item.  The steak, lobster tails, and everything here is truly wonderful.  A meal here is not something you can fit in when you are on a tight schedule.  It is a true culinary experience!  Miami!",
      "Crabs  were delicious !!! My the best experience in my life ! We celebrated Russian Old New Year!!! It was nice !",
      "BLUF: a classy restaurant that isn't pretentious and serves very good food.We went there with a large group on a Friday night. Definitely get a reservation if you can because it does get quite crowded. Most of us had the Crab Claw dinner although a couple had the filet mignon. The filet mignons were perfectly cooked and very flavorful. They're not very large but considering that you can eat every bit of it without any bone or Gristle it's actually quite filling. The crab claws were sweet and, wonderfully, pre cracked. Made eating them a lot easier. The one thing I didn't like is the dipping sauce served with it which was a heavy Mayo based mustard flavored dipping sauce. Playing butter would have been a lot better as the sauce was quite heavy and sort of overpower the flavor of the crab.The Bread Basket that comes up before the meal is filled with delicious and unique breads. All quite tasty. For our sides we had sweet potato fries, creamed spinach, and hash browns. The fries are delicious, as was the spinach. I thought the hash browns were a bit flavorless.For dessert we had the restaurant specialty key lime pie. It was quite good and served with some amazingly Rich whipped cream on top. Most of us saved a little bit of cream to add to her after dinner coffee, which was delicious.The staff is all very formally dressed and treats everyone like royalty, even if you are wearing shorts and a t-shirt. Our waiter actually took the time between courses to give us a history lesson about the restaurant, how the crabs are harvested and why they're serve cold, and the history of the key lime pie which is their signature dessertI would definitely go back, but it is a relatively pricey dinner, so it's not something that most families could afford on a regular basis. But if you're in Miami and looking to do something that's part of the local culture and history give it a go.",
      "The food was pretty good, but the check-in process seems pretty messed up. We had 6pm reservations and were not seated until 7:15 even though we checked in a little before 6pm. It appears that everyone is expected to hang out at the bar for an hour and order a couple of $20 cocktails while waiting for their table.  This was particularly annoying because we wanted an outdoor table, but ended up spending more time indoors by the crowded bar than we spent outdoors dining at our table.Anyway, their Key Lime martini tasted just like key lime pie and I had plenty of time to enjoy it at the extremely crowded indoor bar while waiting for our table.We were finally seated at a lovely outdoor table at their patio, and the service and food were good. We had the large stone crab claws, fried Maine lobster tails, steamed asparagus, hash browns, and the baked clam stuffies. The stone crab claws were great - very meaty, although very pricey at $85! I hadn't had stone crab claws before, and they had a deliciously tender and slightly sweet - not unlike Dungeness crab body meat, but the meat came out in much larger chunks. The fried lobster tails were also excellent - perfectly fried, and the hashed browns lived up to their reputation as being excellent hash browns. The steamed asparagus were exactly as what one would expect (we just wanted a side of healthy veggies). I was not really a fan of the clam stuffies - they tasted mostly like sausage and cream without too much clams.We finished off the meal with an excellent slice of key lime pie.Overall the meal was good, but I'd probably avoid the wait and go to Joe's takeaway next time.",
      "Absolutely 100% positively worth it!From the moment you walk up to the main gates, greeted by the . . . bouncer? you are embraced in the legacy and history of Joe's. Although I had known very little about the history before visiting (a quick trip to Youtube after really enlightened my knowledge about Joe's) you can tell they hold up integrity, quality, and their legacy for each and every guest.Our waiter, Andres (who looks so much like Manny from Scarface!) was a true gentleman and helped us throughout our whole meal. Being first timers, we definitely wanted the stone crab but weren't quite sure how much to order, what sizes, or what other items. So he at first recommended a large portion per person (there were three of us) as well as the hash browns and creamed spinach, this being a typical and recommended first timer order. My parents aren't fans of creamed spinach and we had plenty of more foodie stops in Miami after so we went with two large stone crabs, the Lyonese hash browns (the regular hash browns with added grilled onions) and the key lime pie to finish. I also ordered a Mule. They start the table with some of the best bread ever, a variety of warm and soft breads you can't help but gobble up. Next came my mule, so perfectly executed with the right amount of sweet and tart while that bartender has a pretty heavy hand with the alcohol! And then the main course - the crab! And hash browns! Andres served us the hash browns and that crust is just insane. It's so crispy and crunchy while the potatoes underneath are almost as soft as mashed potatoes while keeping their firmness of a \"potato\" - if that makes any sense, ha! The grilled onions are so well done for a balance of sweetness while the mustard sauce, although brought for the crab, also goes perfectly with the potatoes.Finally the stone crab - WOW. You really do not expect crab, or any seafood to have this sublime taste until you actually try it yourself. The worst part about this is getting the small cracked shell pieces and bits off to dig in as fast as you can. The meat is so soft that even using a fork makes the meat just fall apart. The meat is so buttery and sweet with a hint of the ocean from a salty balance. The mustard also goes well with it coating the meat in it's sharp counter balance and creaminess.These stone crabs may be served elsewhere, but the entire experience and trust in the process of preparing them here makes it beyond worth the visit. I will happily return for future visits!",
      "Well I finally did it.... I ate at Joe's Stone Crab!! I had take out from the window before but you miss the whole experience. What a treat!!We had a party of 7 so we ordered family style. We had the stuffies to start off. Family style meant we each got one whole stuffed clam. The stuffing was moist and the clam was not the least bit chewy. So good!  The Medium sized crabs (they are the sweetest of the sizes) were succulent and had the just the right amount of creamy fat in the shell. \"Stone Crab Lovers\" know what I mean.  We also had the $8 fried chicken (1/2 a chicken) that Joe's lovers truly say is a must try. The crust was flaky and not at all oily.  Delicious!  We had the hash browns, spinach and asparagus as our sides. Just the right amount of accompaniments.What was for dessert? Joe's homemade Key Lime Pie of course. It was a perfect Key Lime pie with the whipped cream too!I almost forgot....The service was on point and not pretentious. Our server was polite, provided suggestions and never rushed our table. She has worked for Joe's for 16 years and you could tell she was happy to work there.*****Tip we had a 5:30pm reservation....we were seated immediately. When we left hours later it was packed with people standing around the hostess area and bar. *****You don't have to valet. There is a large parking lot across the street. Its free for Joe's patrons."

      "I've driven past this restaurant for a while and have wanted to try it for a long time. I finally got the opportunity to go last night. We were a party of 6. I was able to make a reservation for that night online. Thank goodness I did because when I went to check in they were turning people away because they were fully booked up. The weather was absolutely perfect! It needs to be, as I realized that all of their seating is outside. They were very busy, so the service was a little slow, but they did the best they could. Unfortunately they were out of A LOT of their drinks. Like, 7 different Pinot Noir! And the beer that my husband wanted. Thankfully the Sauvignon blanc that I wanted was in stock and it was also only $9 a glass (the cheapest on the menu)! As an appetizer we ordered the spinach artichoke dip. It was ok. It was tepid. Not hot. There weren't enough chips to go with it so we asked for more. The chips are clearly homemade in house and we're very good. Everyone devoured it as we were all pretty hungry. For dinner I ordered the chicken Mediterranean salad, my husband ordered the brick roasted half chicken, my daughter ordered the spicy vodka rigatoni, our friends ordered the burger and the steak. All of the food was very good. I ate every bite of my salad. My daughter ate all of her pasta. I feel the portion of the pasta was pretty small. She's only 100 pounds and could have eaten more. Everyone enjoyed their meals. The only person with leftovers was my husband who had the half chicken. One of our daughters was not hungry and only got a non-alcoholic drink. After splitting the bill with our friends, ours was $111 for 3 entrees, and 3 drinks, including a 20% automatic gratuity. Without tip our bill was $89. No appetizer or desserts on our bill. It's very easy to spend $50-60 per person here. We were able to keep it reasonable. They had live music. It was Latin Jazz night. It was very nice. The entire ambience of the restaurant is beautiful! The lights, the trees and plants, being outdoors... it's just wonderful. I would love to go here for happy hour (3pm to 6pm M-F) and just sit and drink and enjoy the outdoors. I'll definitely be back.",
      "This spot has its charm and is good, but it won't blow your socks off. I had been eyeing glass and vine for a bit now and I'm so glad I was able to come. It's definitely a great lunch spot. Food: I had the burger with a side of truffle fries and it did not disappoint. I am definitely a fan of hearty meals and this one took the cake. The size of the burger was HUMONGOUS. For desert we had the chocolate cake which comes with ice cream. Our waiter forgot the ice cream though so it was not in the picture. It was very rich and tasty. Location & Accessibility: If you want somewhere quaint in the heart of the grove I would recommend this location. Parking is easily accessible with the garage right across (which is normally not the case for any thing in the grove). It is also next to a public park but far enough to not be bothersome. The bathrooms were horrendous though so be warned.",
      "Great ambiance and setting! Few places in Miami can bring you an outdoor patio with natural trees. We had a fantastic time at Glass and Vine. Food was delicious, timing was on point, and our server Stefano was attentive and engaged - he really made it for quite an experience. Will definitively go again.",
      "I absolutely loved this place. I had it bookmarked for the next time I visited South Miami. I had the perfect occasion with my girlfriends visiting from New York. We made our reservation well over a week in advance. However when we arrived, we had to wait for about 30mins. Usually this would annoy me, but they had live music and space at the bar for us. The band and singer made the place so upbeat but classy. The bartenders were attentive and service there was quick. When we finally got seated, it was perfect. I don't think this place has a bad seat overall. Our servers were quick to take our orders. The food was wonderful and the drinks got us to the fun place. I ate light... I had the Tuna Tartare and a couple cocktails. It was a wonderful quick visit and will be back.",
      "One of my favorite spots in the Grove. The ambiance is amazing being next to a beautiful park. We sat outside for a friend's birthday and luckily they had a table for 7 people (we didn't have a res ). We started off with a round of drinks, mostly espresso martinis. Then we got the watermelon salad and fish dip to start. They were very delicious and stunning! I ordered the chicken club for my main dish with truffle fries (upcharge for the truffle). Everything came out as ordered, but my fries weren't hot..kinda bummer. The sandwich was good and my friends liked their dishes. I have to say the restrooms are not looked after so be prepared. They share their restrooms with the kids playground next door which I find kinda odd. Would love to come back to try another dish or for happy hour",
      "I would have given this restaurant a better review had it not been for the service. We came on a Wednesday at 2 and asked for a table outside. We were told there was a 45min wait and we said fine. (Even though the patio had plenty of empty tables, we figured they might be understaffed. Also, our whole party still hadn't arrived yet.) We were a party of 4 adults and two babies. (Everyone was there before the 45 min wait was over.) An hour later, I asked if there would be a time frame as to when we would be seated. This was despite my friend asking at 45 min mark the same question. When I asked the manager (the only one with a blazer on) told us she thought we had left and that she would seat us after she sat someone else (outside). Although, my friend and her baby were starving by this point, we were still understanding and took management's explanation. We sat at the table for another 25 mins before I called a waitress to please tell who ever our server was to come see us or at least bring us water. All in all, the lack of attention to service and lack of courtesy to potential diners completely tainted our experience here. I will say the food I tried was delicious. The concept is cute, as in, many parents would want to sit outside next to the playground. But the service to get you seated is dismal. If it hadn't been my friend's birthday and her wanting to eat there, I honestly wouldn't have even dined there. As they did everything to repel us from doing so. Our actual waitress did try to make it up to us. And really none of it was her fault. So she did a great job given the circumstances. So my tip don't come here on a whim if you are a party larger than 2. Make sure you have a reservation. And come with plenty of time to wait just in case they don't honor it.",
      "My wife are regulars at the bar. Treated like family every time we walk in. Great and drinks!!John the bartender is amazing!!",
      "My wife and I are locals and come to G and V every Friday afternoon for happy hour. Wine and apps always great and bar staff amazingly attentive and professional. Park setting doesn't hurt either!!",
      "Glass and Vine has a very nice ambiance with tons of outdoor covered seating.  I have never had a bad meal here.  I have received good service every time I have been in as well.  I was there for a large party and had a special menu the last time I was in.  The menu was made up of some of their regular items.  The watermelon salad was superb.  The yuca appetizer was also very good.  The salmon was really well done and was high quality.  The only negative about Glass and Vine is that the bar is kind of small and unless you have a reservation it will be hard to get seated, or even order at the bar.  All in all, very cool vibe, and good food.  This is a Coconut Grove classic.",
      "L ovely restaurant for dinner and lunch. I had the croquettes and spinach and artichoke dip, and wow, they were amazing. The croquettes had a special kick flavor and were so crispy and juicy. Definitely the night's star. Enjoyed the grilled miso salmon as well as the chicken and black truffle gnocchi. The salmon was tasty but somewhat bland. The rich but delicious black truffle gnocchi was really good. It was so convenient for parents of young children since it was connected to a park, which I liked. I went there for dinner and enjoyed the live music and the evening's featured musician. Made the environment more romantic. I have to agree with many of the reviews regarding the AC, but since we live in Florida, the humidity is obviously bound to happen anywhere outdoor."

      "Second visit at red rooster. Firs time was sometime last year for brunch. Nothing I can remember much of honestly. But have been wanting to come back to try the dinner. Took my best friend for her birthday on a Wednesday night. We dined around 9pm, place was pretty empty plenty of parking was available. We parked in the lot next directly next to the building. Parking rate was $15 for the first 4 hours. We were greeted immediately by the host who was welcoming and all smiles. She offered us inside or outside seating we chose outside. The outside is a covered patio area very you're outside but still feel like you're inside feel. Relaxing and comfortable. Our server Jessica was AMAZINGGGG! It was the energy for me!!!!!!! She was knowledgable, welcoming and most importantly hospitable. Literally felt like we were in her home. As I've stated I have dined before but this experience was completely different. Jessica really took the time to tell us the history of red rooster. Gave recommendations of drinks, food and what I love the most - she gave us space. She was interactive but not overbearing. She interacted but still gave us our space to enjoy our meal and converse. Lets take about food : We ordered the cornbread and deviled eggs as an appetizer both 10/10 the cornbread was sweet but the accompanied butter was the show stopper! Deviled eggs were creamy yet flavorful and perfectly paired with a chicharron on top, perfect touch. For the meal I ordered the Shrimp & Grits, my friend ordered the crab boil and we shared a side of macaroni and cheese. The shrimp and grits were just ok to me :( , I expected more. Not more of portion or flavor, im not sure what was \"missing\" but it was an instant regret as I watch my friend go in on her seafood bowl lol I don't return food unless its something with the quality of the cooking. I chose the meal and just because it isn't my \"favorite\" doesn't mean I have to waste the food. It wasn't terrible don't get me wrong, I think it was maybe a consistency thing. The grits gave an almost cauliflower grits texture. if you've ever had cauliflower grits its like a chunky but watery texture. If that makes sense? Overall the flavor.Overall the experience was great, service was great the whole place is a vibe and would definitely recommend and return !",
      "I went to brunch at red rooster on New Year's Day! I made sure I had my reservation in because i knew it would be busy! From the moment I arrived the service was great and even though it seemed that they were slightly understaffed everyone especially our waitress really made it work. Our waitress worked so hard to give us great service while staying really busy on New Year's Day! I'm sad I did not get her name but we sat outside in the patio, party of 7 from 1pm to almost 5pm! Thank you!! The food was fantastic I didn't get a picture of the waffles which were phenomenal! The chicken was so yummy and juicy! I got the oysters which I would say are not for everyone but I love ls them! Also got the Caesar salad with the buttered crab. The buttered crab was full of flavor and the cornbread with the jalapeño spread was delicious! Highly recommend!",
      "As a Harlem resident for the past 7 years and a Red Rooster lover I was so excited to try the Red Rooster in Miami. Don't expect them to honor the time of your reservation. We had to wait over 30 mins to be seated even though the restaurant was AT BEST at 40% occupancy. We stood there looking at all these empty tables as the mins ticked by past our reservation time. The hostess was BEYOND RUDE. I'm talking about raising her voice, rolling her eyes, becoming aggressive and then when we asked her to tone it down, switching to a fake sugary sweet mocking tone. I haven't experienced anyone that disrespectful, condescending, and vile in the service industry in a very long time. She was disgraceful and definitely tainted the entire experience. Imagine working at a restaurant and having this kind of disdain towards its patrons. Sufficed to say that I'll never go back to this restaurant and I'll make sure to tell all my Miami friends and family to avoid this restaurant like the plague. They can come to NYC and enjoy a great Red Rooster dinging experience in Harlem. I would like to note that our server was absolutely lovely.

      "Visited for lunch and wasn't super thrilled but maybe we ordered the wrong stuff. The cornbread was super duper good though. Ordered salads w fried chicken but chicken had grill marks and random crunch. Side of fries was $12 and they weren't amazing. I saw a lot of burgers going around so I think that may have been the right thing to order.   Hands down gorgeous space!  The decor transports you to another era. Service wasn't bad or amazing but the servers were very nice. I want to come back for the brunch and hear the gospel singers. Get a tower or burger.",

      "Very impressed with the food. Everything was delicious. The decorations are very nice and picture perfect. We dined inside which had low lighting and a nice ambience. The deviled eggs were delicious and topped with a fried pork rinds. My friends had the fried chicken in which they said was to die for. The cornbread was unbelievably good, make sure to order one for each person because it's hard to not eat the whole thing by yourself. I would highly recommend trying this establishment.",
      "Such great news, Jas! It sounds like you and your friends had a great time at Red Rooster Overtown, and we could not be happier! Thank you for coming by! We appreciate your kind words and hope to host you again one day soon.All the best,The Red Rooster Overtown Restaurant Team",
      "If ZERO STARS WAS AN OPTION, THIS WOULD BE A ZERO. With the highest of expectations, we visited Red Rooster for Christmas dinner. We were informed in advance they were operating on a pre fixe only menu, at $75 per person. We excitedly obliged. We arrived on time for our 9:45pm holiday dinner and were promptly seated. It took a while for our server to arrive. He asked for drink orders as well as food allergies. I informed him of my pineapple allergy, to which he replied \"There's no pineapple on the dinner menu tonight, so you're good.\"  We ordered the kale salad and cornbread as our starters. The salad was listed with \"seasonal fruit\". I asked what that was and the server said \"mango and peaches\". Two bites into the salad and my ears were hot, and my throat was inflamed and itching.  I flagged the server, holding my fork I asked AGAIN about the fruit. He said \"that's not pineapple, it's mango\". I requested that he triple check with the kitchen as my reaction was saying it was DEFINITELY PINEAPPLE. He returned with arms signaling to stop eating. Saying \"they must've run out of mango, it's pineapple\". I was LIVID!!!! Especially since he completely dismissed my concerns initially. The manager came and offered minimal apology and concern and we were told to let them know if my reaction got worse. They brought out the rest of the food, which was served family style. Already upset and frustrated, the remaining items were BEYOND disappointing. Everything was lukewarm, and appeared to have been sitting for a LONG time. Everything was dry and unappetizing. We picked at it, I was terrified to eat, as I was still having an allergic reaction. At the end of the \"meal\" our server said the manager was making adjustments to the check. The adjustment was a 25% discount for the \"inconvenience\" (of almost killing me!!!!). TWENTY FIVE PERCENT off a bill that INCLUDED A 20% GRATUITY!!!! The audacity! I was pissed. I could not believe I was still charged for a full meal that I didn't eat and could've put me in the hospital. I will never return or recommend this establishment. I was so excited to try Marcus Samuelsson's restaurant. Everything was a let down, especially the manner in which my allergy was handled. The pictures speak for themselves. I should've listened to the other reviews that mentioned the terrible service. Lesson learned.",
      "Waitress Spencica had my back immediately upon being seated.  Popped in for a late lunch/dinner thing and the staff were busy prepping for the upcoming dinner service. It was such a lovely and lively atmosphere. One of the waitresses was pregnant and she was an absolute doll. Every one of the staff had each other's backs and was checking in and helping out. I even got to see their huddle for the dinner service which was neat. Love the collaboration and love that pours from every inch of this place.Bar and general decor is classy and hip. Love the music I was jamming out while i was getting my grub on too. Every single dish was delightful and I even got a celebratory glass of champagne for getting through chemo! Gotta love the kindness of people.Definitely want to get back here for more menu exploring and venue too. Love the vibes of this place.",

      "I made sure to stop by Red Rooster during Miami Spice! I went for a dinner for two during a weeknight, and the restaurant was surprisingly empty. Towards the end of the night, more and more tables started arriving, but service was consistent throughout. Since we had their Miami Spice menu, I can't really speak to many of their dishes. I had the deviled eggs, fried chicken, and key lime dessert. The food was good and definitely unique. My only complaint is the long time between serving dishes; we were waiting on a salad that didn't come out until right before our entrees. Nonetheless, they have good food and also a creative drink menu that did not disappoint!",
      "Dear Megan,Thank you for joining us during Miami Spice - it is such a great way to explore our menu, and it appears you enjoyed some of our signature dishes, and we could not be happier.Please come back and try out some of our other items; we are confident you will not be disappointed.Cheers!The Red Rooster Overtown Team"

      "Delightful vegan food with outdoor only seating and a good range of items. Counter service only and casual vibes makes this a great lunch place.They have a good range of Mexican/Colombian and other latin classics, all vegan and many gluten free as well.There is also fresh juice, smoothies and a range of cold health-centric bottled drinks as well.Definitely a good find if your in the downtown/Brickell area!",
      "They are back, I have been craving one if they burgers for a few months. They went thru renovations and now that this place has reopened I finally can kick my cravings goodbye. After watching the world cup's matches I was really hungry so I went for it! The Mr. Mitrano burger, it still be the best vegan burger in Miami, cool to perfection and so tasty you will come back to try the rest of the menu (all vegan and delicious)Their service is incredible and all though it feels like a fast food place, you can notice the care they put in their craft. The place is small but is has a nice outdoor sitting area with enough room for  around 40 people. This place is a must if you are around Brickell. BTW, they are super ecofriendly and even cultivate their own herbs!!!!!",
      "Read the reviews...none overstated.  Awesome. Great food, lovely music and first class service.",
      "BIG YES. A Latin vegan restaurant in Miami? How could you go wrong? The Cocinita Miami did it right. After completely drooling over the Yelp pictures, I made my way over here to try out the arepa. For starters, the service here, was great. I couldn't decide what to order, and the owner (I believe) was extremely helpful in helping me decide what I would like best. He did not steer me wrong. I went with the cocinita arepa (one of the most popular menu items). Was it good? Yes. Was it great? Absolutely. The ingredients in this arepa just paired so well together and was so filling and flavorful. Highly recommend checking this place out.",
      "I love the idea of a Latin vegan restaurant in Brickell. It's well needed for the small portion of Miamians that don't eat meat. The parking? Not the best but you're in Brickell. The food? Amazing. Price point? A little over priced but then again you are in Brickell. I forgot what burger I ordered because I may have had a couple margaritas prior to coming here but I just remember it was delicious (I think Mr.Mitrano). My friend even made a comment that it was one of the best veggie burgers she's ever had. We got regular fries, but looking back I will order something more interesting. This is the perfect spot to come to after a couple drinks.",
      "Words cannot express how much I love this place. During a recent trip to Miami we wanted authentic Latin fare, but due to our plant-based nutrition preferences were having some trouble. Enter The Cocinita Miami. Rarely do I struggle to decide what to order when dining out, as there are typically only a few plant-based options on any given menu. No so here - the ENTIRE menu is vegan, and as such, making a decision can be tricky. Luckily the gentleman taking our order was very patient and helpful, and assisted with answering all my questions, as such guiding me toward the perfect dinner.The Cachapa - vegan corn pancake folded on top of SO much vegan cheese. Comparable (and actually more tasty) than a non-vegan version I had in a past life. I'm still dreaming about this.The Perrito - a big fancy hotdog:  sausage, coleslaw, chimichurri and garlic sauces, topped with crispy potato sticks.Baked plantains and sweet potato fries - just get these.I truly have only glowing things to say about this place. My only criticism is that they are located in Miami, rather than next door to my house. That cachapa...",
      "One of my favorite vegan restaurants in all of Miami!! And searching for one is what I do for fun!My absolute favorite is the Choricachapa! This place is a mind blowing vegan replica of authentic food from Colombian and Venezuelan culture.These cachapas are exactly what you would find on local street carts - BUT VEGAN. I recommend this place enough! Also located in the middle of brickell with beautiful high rise views!",
      "Hands down the best vegan burger I've ever had! I was in the mood for coleslaw, so I went with the Mr.Mitrano burger, and it was vegan gastronomy heaven. All the flavors complimented each other well, the bun was perfectly toasted and warmed, and the burger wasn't dry at all (I'd take a wet/saucy burger over a dry one any day)! The fries were crispy, hot, and addicting.  I ended up wanting to eat my husbands sweet potato fries, more than mine. A great sweet potato fry is hard to come by. The cauliflower burrito was very filling and tasty per my husbands remarks. Other pros: sustainable cutlery and to-go containers, generous portions, health conscious drinks and kombuchas, vegan appetizers, meals, and desserts worth trying .Cons: hard to find and near parking is hard to find on the weekend. This is a great spot to take your vegan curious friends, family or self.",
      "I was so excited to find a vegan restaurant near my hotel after arriving late on a Sunday night. And even better, they delivered! (With a cute personalized delivery bag.)I'm glad this place exists and they definitely have the kind of menu items I love, but it didn't quite hit the mark for me. The special fries were my favorite part (sooooo many fries though, better to share!) -- those sauces are amazing and I'd believe it if you told me they had dairy in them (they don't!). The cheese empanada was also quite good and came with the same dipping sauce as the fries.The arepa was made of a very healthy grain mixture and was kind of tough to bite into. Not at all a typical corn arepa and I didn't enjoy the texture. Also note that all the plantains on the menu are sweet plantains -- wish I knew before I ordered, because I ended up picking all the plantains out of my arepa. (I prefer the savory tostones style of plantains). The lentil soup was ok but nothing special. My delivery also didn't include utensils (didn't know to ask) so I didn't have a spoon for my soup and had to improvise with a fork in my hotel room. Overall I'm glad this option exists in the neighborhood, but I might order different items in the future."

      "On the spur of the moment decided to visit Cubata.  The place is just great.  The vibe is lively and the space very nice.  Everything we had was delicious.  Pan con tomate, croquetas,  and garlic shrimp were perfectly made.  They have main dishes but we didn't try them . I was told the chef is Cuban but lived many years in Spain.  It shows as the tapas are expertly executed.  We had one of the best mojitos in Miami!!Service was attentive We were not expecting it but they had excellent live music.  We were also told they have great HH.You won't be disappointed",
      "Cubata is a restaurant situated in the heart Little Havana, in Calle Ocho.  Little Havana has become a hot spot place for local and tourists alike to eat, shop and people watch. As you enter the place, the setting is quaint with Spanish inspired decor throughout.  At any table, you have a wonderful view of the bar where you can see the bartenders crafting their signature cocktails. For those looking to sit outside, there are about 5 small tables, perfect for enjoying the south Florida weather and people watching.There is a nice, small list of cocktails, beer and wine that will suit your current mood.  We decided to have a couple of glasses of wine from the house list.  At first I had the Tempranillo, to be honest, I found it to be sweet and a little off for being a Tempranillo.  The staff, was very accommodating and switched me over to the cab which was more my style.  The service was a bit slow for a Saturday afternoon, but the staff was very nice.  We did not get the chance to try any of the food, only because we ate a big lunch prior to visiting, but we hope to return, especially for happy hour.",
      "This place is excellent. Happy hour every day 4 to 8 PM with half price on all alcohol. Drinks is an amazing deal. We got nice and refreshed and did not break the bank. The food options are quite nice as well and the service is very good. Will definitely go back next time. I'm in Miami.",
      "Cafeteria vibes. Amazing guac & tacos. It's a order & deliver service for food. Great last min late night spot if your craving Mexican!",
      "Excelent food and service. We went for happy hour with friend and enjoyed a variety of delicious tapas and drinks. Special mention to their \"matador cocktail\" and \"pan de cristal\"",
      "Muy rica la comida , sobretodo los huevos rotos que no hay otro lugar que me hagan los huevos como me gustan como aquí , el pulpo a la gallega y las coquetas(mi favoritas) el servicio muy bueno y el ambiente súper agradable , 1000% recomendado , la sangría deliciosa también",
      "Walked up and down Little Havana and worked up an appetite. The worst thing that can happen to a hungry tourist is become ...  a HANGRY TOURIST! Hahahahaha! The service was just super slow... sloth-like. But once the food started coming out and my drink got served, the monster in me just melted away. Solomillo de Res con Salsa de Vino -medium + Papas Fritas Mediterraneas + Spicy Margarita",
      "What a little tiny gem, in the heart of Little Havana! Spanish tapa with a Cuban twist. Nice wine selection! Live music. Service is exceptional very attentive! Out door seating. Outdoor cigar friendly! Croquettes ham and Cod were very tasty .  Aparentaron Sundays they have live music too.",
      "I looooove this place, the live music, location and food. Brought cousin who was visiting from Atlanta and he too fell in love with the joint. We order some tapas like gambas al ajillo(shrimp in garlic sauce, the assorted croquetas, the board with ibérico and prosciutto, manchego cheese, also the ensaladilla rusa(potato salad) and the octopus which was one of my faves. They had live music, like tropical and salsa and that added the perfect ambiance for a Friday night whilst enjoying a bottle of Rioja red wine and sitting outside with perfect weather. Will have to come back to try a few more tapas that got my attention. This spot is perfect for a group of friends to get together before a night of fun.",
      "Food came out Cold and it was supposed to be hot sandwiches. Also, we ordered salad and beans and the sandwiches came out before the salad and beans. We waited for a long time for the beans and salad ti come out and it should have came out before the sandwiches. I would not recommend at all."

My friend and I have visited 2-3 different locations trying to track down their pop up location but we fail every time lol - so if you really want to try it i recommend ordering on grubhub!!! Arrived super fast. Good korean food is hard to come by in Miami so this was amazingGochuchang brownies were your typical brownies i was expecting something different but still satisfied.",
      "my girlfriend and i found this restaurant as it was nearby and was the only one that would deliver to us what we wanted. it was also a big appeal that it was vegan friendly, and the heart-shaped eggs were so cute! the website was a little annoying to navigate with the pop-ups pushing us to subscribe to their email newsletter every time we clicked on something (and it's hard to get rid of it...). unfortunately, our orders were both completely messed up/incorrect. we ordered custom bowls as advertised on the website, and it seems that they just... gave us what they wanted us to have? lolwe were missing items we asked for, and we had items that we didn't ask for. my girlfriend's bowl was swimming in gochujang which was much spicier than she wanted (she didn't even ask for gochujang) and our orders were so messed up that my girlfriend was afraid that her dish may have contained meat when she is vegan.",
      "Stingiest bibimbap I've ever had. It's not worth the price for such an empty bowl. Also they don't taste authentic at all.",
      "I ordered 2 Korean Girls from Uber meats recently and I musty say I loved it! Both my friend and I ordered the Bibimbap. They were tasty, with a nice kick of spice, careful if you're not into the spicy! It was hot!! I wound say the I okay reason I took off a star was the delivery time was over 1 and a half hour ms, too long, hopefully that can have a stand alone restaurant space soon.",
      "Had the Bibimbap Bowl. It was fresh, spicy, a melody of bold flavors. The egg on top was so cute. I devoured it. That's why there's no pic.I did however slow down and take a pic of the Korean fried chicken Drumstick...they had gold edible stars on everything which was sooooo cute! And definitely not wasted on me. I loved it!! The drumstick was resting on top of some dank kimchi and I also consumed that. There was nothing left.I totally needed a win and this meal knocked it out of the park! Will be a loyal, regular customer from now on.",
      "I just moved down to Brickell from Alexandria, VA and was worried I wouldn't be able to get my Korean food fix. Alexandria is close to Annadale which has a plethora of Korean restaurant's and take out spots. Whilst perusing UberEATS today I decided to see what the area had to offer to satiate my K-food desire. 2 Korean Girls popped up. I eagerly awaited the arrival of the driver and cautiously opened the cool box the food came in. I ordered the \"Oh you spicy huh\" and the \"kimchi fried rice.\" both were fantastic!The \"oh you spicy huh\" had an excellent assortment of veggies, chicken, sauce and kimchi - mixed all together it was the perfect \"light\" but substantial meal. The kimchi fried rice was excellent as well, I'll definitely have to pop in sometime to get my k-food fix in person sometime. I would have taken a picture, but I ate all the food already.",
      "Super cute boxes, super cute concept, super cute heart shaped egg! Have you ever seen a prettier egg - with delicate sesame seeds sprinkled on top and gold little stars! see my picture to appreciate it.And above all the food smelt amazing as you walked past, and also tasted pretty good too. Well done! I wish there had been more sauce with my dish. Also imo there is too much white rice with regards to the other portions given. I have tried kimchee before and really disliked it.  I used to be a nanny for a Korean family - and their whole fridge smelt bad, from Kimchee.  However, this KIMCHEE was fabulous.  Thank you for making me try it again and this time making me appreciate why most people like it.",
      "Absolutely delicious ALL GLUTEN FREE MENU. Smack in the heart of Coconut Grove, this is a pick up and delivery only business. I found picking up super easy, as you can park right up by their open front counter. So happy I got to enjoy this YES! Event. Elite perks yay!! LOVED the bowl, \"Oh, you spicy huh,\" the bubble tea, and the cookie. Dying to get back there for more!",
      "Ummmm.. there are golden stars sprinkled on my heart-shaped egg. Nuff said. Oh also, it's freaking delicious!",
      "DON'T BOTHER if you've ever lived in NYC, Chicago, etc.THE BIBIMBOP was small, MEDIOCRE, with NO WONDERFUL SIDES as they have in wonderful KOREAN restaurants in major cities.....And the price was DOUBLE what one would normally pay!!I also made the mistake of getting a frozen Pina colada $ 20.00 and it was TINY!!!!!Always ask when buying a drink in Miami!!!!!I happened to live in NYC for 30 years. Korean restaurants there serve wonderful sides, potato salads, lotus roots, greens, Kimchee, squid (I don't eat fish but it looks good), etc.ALSO, LIKE MANY RESTAURANTS IN MIAMI, the music is often rap or salsa and LOUD!!!!!!!YUCK°°°°"

Juliana was our server and was very attentive and always making sure we were comfortable and bringing us water. She recommended an appetizer which we weren't going to get but she convinced us and we had the Chicharrón and beef Hallaquita which was a great choice. I also had the fritanga bowl, a must get!

We have never visited the establishment in person so this review is only based on delivery.  The food is so fresh and really has the authentic Venezuelian taste. The tequenos are juicy, fresh and crispy. We always order the Pabellon Criollo Venezolano which never disappoints, the Chicharron was flavorful and crispy. We love their salads which we usually pair with the slamon. If you are ever craving some comfort food Boca is the place for you.

When I told her no just use the spirit that's on the page she rolled her eyes. Plus I was going there to propose to my fiancé cause she's been excited to go to you for a while and I asked for a lower table to get on one knee and they gave me a high top.

      "When I first moved into the Nordica, I was excited to know there was a Venezuelan restaurant. I liked at first, then their flavor as well as their prices started to change over the last 6 months. Unfortunately not in a positive direction, one would've hoped it was. We've had multiple plates, every time, the meat is tough, full of tendons and lacks flavor. Very sad to say, but I wont be visiting them anymore, even if they're just downstairs. I hope in the future they improve and I'll be happy to become a patron once again. I was not a one and one client, I've ordered at least 4 or 5 times since moving here in late 2020.",

      "They've got an awesome beach dining operation going on here - but I'm compelled to give 5 stars because their food is also delicious & fairly priced in my opinion.There were young men combing the beach goers to hand out their simple & effective menu with just the right amount of lobster roll, taco, cocktail & beer selections just in case the beach chair rental kiosk guys didn't already hand the menu to the beach goers. I would normally think everything would be grossly overpriced for such convenience of ordering in your beach chair, but $5.50 for a generously sized taco? Count me in please! We ordered a South beach lobster roll, 1 each of fish taco and blackened shrimp taco, a virgin piña colada, a bottle of corona, and a jalapeño coleslaw, and everything was done over text which the restaurant responded promptly. The slaw was added 3 min after initial confirmation via text and they modified and gave new total quickly. What surprised me more was how quickly a gentleman came with an ice bucket of our drinks, saying he'll be back with our food in short order- a great service since beach goers would love to drink something first under the hot sun. Food arrived within 10 minutes of the drinks and they were well packaged in individual paper boxes, napkins, fork, inside a large brown bag. Now onto the food - lobster roll was perfect- that lightness of subtly dressed chunks of lobster with bacon strips and avocados (that's the only difference from classic) on flaky bread was just joyful. My flaky fish tacos and chewy shrimp tacos were nicely paired by surprisingly delicious jalapeño slaw which, contrary to wife's fear of being too spicy, it was neither spicy nor heavy- so much so that she commented that she could just eat the slaw by itself! Her piña colada was not overly sweet but tasty and we enjoyed the ice bucket long after our drinks were gone. We were well satisfied with the delicious lunch eaten at the comfort of our beach lounger under the umbrella, and highly recommend lobster shack to everyone! A++!",
      "From what we sampled I will definitely give this place a thumbs up, let me break down everything we sampled and how all of it fairedCame here with 2 friends from work and we literally sampled close to everything, and I would be happy to do it again, that is order same stuff and then more, here is an idea of what we sampled Lobster rolls -Classic - buttery, fresh not rubbery, deliciousCajun Lobster roll - slight kick needs more of that cajun seasoning to give it that extra kick, but the roll again was buttery and it was deliciousTacosFish tacos - deep fried happinessBlackend Shrimp taco seasoned well, may have to come back and sample 4 more of these just for myself Lobster taco - like all the other items that have lobster in them, this was deliciousEntreesLive Maine lobster - If I recall we ordered 2 of these to share between the 3 of us, you may need to order 4 total to keep everyone happy lolAgain everything we sampled was good, next time I am in Miami I will need to bring the kids and wifefood ****price $$service *****ambiance *****",
      "got the clam chowder and the lobster roll. clam chowder was delicious and the lobster roll but to me, slightly overcooked. but still delicious. decent price for it too especially for miami",
      "CAJUN LOBSTER ROLL - The quality of the lobster here is great and I loved the seasonings! My main gripe is the price-to-portion ratio. The roll is quite small and on its own is arguably more a snack than a meal. Doesn't feel great when you're paying $25 for one of these things. Come here for quality, but I'd go somewhere else if you're feeling pretty hungry.",
      "I agree with most other reviewers about the quality of the food.  It is excellent.  I think the prices are fair.  Lobster rolls don't come cheap! So why only 3 stars?  Because, as one other reviewer pointed out, they add a 15% gratuity!  This is standard practice all along Lincoln Rd, but NOT FOR A WALK UP AND ORDER AT THE COUNTER place.  It's outrageous",
      "Pros:-location - good outdoor seating (small indoor seating)- fast service - pay upfront; delivered to your table - king claw lobster roll Cons: - the lobster bisque v clam chowder was nearly identical - perhaps a tourist trap but it was good- the spinach and cheese oyster This spot is right off the beach so whether you are looking for a nice little meal off the surf or off the street this is the place for you. We went in for lunch and there was plenty of seating at the time. Each item on the menu was about $20 so expect to be dropping a few coins in this establishment. Food: Lobster Bisque: 2/5 - Tasted like clam chowder but without the clams and it was yellow. Clam Chowder: 2/5 - Tasted like lobster bisque but with little clam meat. Oysters: 3/5 - It was to my understanding that we got the raw oysters but we were all surprised when we saw the spinach and cheese on top of ours. As a person who can eat raw fish without hesitation, raw oysters would not be a problem for me. If you are someone who is on the conservative side when consuming raw shellfish then this is a good starter pack for you. You really can't taste the shellfish because of the contents on top.  It tasted like spinach and artichoke dip on top of a shell so if you like those flavors get it. Lobster Roll: 5/5 - Good, fresh, a decent amount of crab. The total bill for 3 (including drinks) was around $130 Note: They do have hot and cold rolls so make sure you look carefully at which has which.",
      "Good place to get a lobster roll and also people watch outside . The cocktails are okay.",
      "Location is right by the Beach. We ordered a spicy lobster roll and the naked lobster roll. Lobster was cooked perfectly for both but not well seasoned. ( Spicy lobster roll is literally a regular roll with sliced jalapeños) For $25 a piece the portion was pretty small. With a water and a modelo the bill was about $75 ( with added gratitudity- didn't understand that when it was self service) maybe a tourist trap but if you're looking for a good lobster roll and don't mind spending the cash try it out.",
      "This place is a little hard to find as the google directions had us all over the place. Street parking was tough but there was a lot across the street with parking. There wasn't any indoor seating which was fine although if I had known that, I probably would have picked somewhere else. Luckily it was shaded and breezy. I had clam chowder and a snow crab cluster. Now, I eat snow crab frequently and I have to say that this was the smallest crab cluster I have ever seen. The crab claw was so teeny, smaller than my pinky. Value-wise, absolutely terrible. Quality-wise, it was fine but not impressive. The chowder was good, no complaints there. My friend said her shrimp tacos were good so I'd provably go that route next time. Just fine but nothing to write home about.",
      "Later back spot with great lobster rolls. You order at the bar and take a seat while they oro epate the tolls. Always served fresh, and with a smile. It's pricey for the ambiance and I think that the tables could be better, but the rolls are so good, you will enjoy it anyways."

      "What an amazing spot, we absolutely LOVED it. It's fairly young and trendy, so I would not take my baby boomer parents here (or a baby in general)- but for a younger, fun, lively crowd, this is perfect. The inside is really cool - lots of artwork, somewhat hidden restaurant, similar to a speakeasy. The drinks were unique and incredible and the food was OUTSTANDING! Very gastronomic - if you're into that sort of thing (my parents wouldn't get it). We basically ordered the entire menu, until we nearly exploded. Here were a few memorable plates (as in, those I can remember after imbibing for a few hours)...Spanglish milk bread - the black salt on top. WOW. They say, once you go black (salt), you never go back right? Exactly. The guava butter was unlike any butter I have ever had. It's very tropical, and fruity! Wagyu beef ravioli - that blue cheese sauce was to die for - take some of that milk bread and drunk your bread in this sauce to your heart's desire (and worry about the consequences later, because bread and cheese, whew!) Nitro Watermelon Tataki - the only remotely healthy thing that entered our mouths at dinner. It's such a cool fish - watermelon, pomegranate seeds, toasted pumpkin seeds, olive oil and a total flavor overload. Not to mention the fact that the fish came out looking like sashimi grade tuna. So cool. Arroz Mamposteado - this was a cool fish. It was rice and beans, but mixed with avocado creme and and pork belly and chips. Incredible. I'm not much of a dessert but holy smokes did we devour the suspiro. I'm quite positive I licked the jar towards the end of the evening - don't judge me. I wish I could remember what cocktail I had, but the choices are all so unique and fun, I should have tried them all. Eh, gives me a reason to go back, right?!",
      "Thank you so much for the kind words and the detailed review of all of our dishes, Shannon.  It was a pleasure hosting you, and we look forward to your next visit!",
      "Obsessed is an understatement.Found this place on Yelp (I love you Yelp!) and with the rating and images I knew I was SOLD. The show stopping, craft cocktails is what I came for and I wasn't sure what to expect once we came. Was it a hype? Would I be disappointed? Who cares! You're in Miami and going to a Spanglish cocktail bar. We didn't make reservations but we did read it wasn't too hard to get in. And it was exactly just that. Came here at around 9:30 pm on a Saturday night and we were seated to the side entrance table with couches right away. It wasn't a good option for dining but we literally only came here for the cocktails so it was perfect!The vibe check in this place was everything. There was a live dj tucked in to the side making sure the music was on point. And it was!On to the craft cocktails:I ordered the Pornstar Mejican@ and it was delicious wish the mezcal was more of the star of the show and to be honest, given that everyone else's cocktails were truthfully visually so pleasing wish the presentation for this one was as well but that's totally ok!!! I still loved my experience. My hubby ordered the Cafetera Old Fashioned and WOW. What a presentation and fun way to serve it with an actual cafetera. It was definitely a show stopper. The Caipirinha Frizá was delicious and very unique as well and the Paparazzi came served in a photo lens so that was pretty cool!We loved Spanglish, would be back in a heart beat. Overall great vibes for cocktails and pretty cool presentation that really makes this place stand out. Excited to try their food next time!",
      "This place gives my New York Vibes OD! It's definitely giving New York Speakeasy Vibes. You'll probably miss it if your not paying attention because the sign outside is only a neon bottle sign. Inside is intimate with the cutest decor, low key, playing all the classic jams. I love a place that sets a vibe with an good playlist! Okayyy! We came for drinks after dinner, so we didn't order food but they did have a menu. All the drinks we ordered were sooo freakin good, and were in creative instagram worthy cups. This is definitely going to be my new hideaway spot. Service was amazing! Will be coming back!",
      "Okay, here's the thing with this place, it's so freaking loud that you can barely hear the person next to you, it's impossible to have any sort of conversation with a large group of people. The food was okay and drinks were pretty good on the other hand, so I think this is a good place for dates, just not a large gathering.",
      "Hi Anton, thank you so much for taking the time to share your experience at Spanglish.  We apologize for the music being too loud, and this is something we’re going to adjust.  Although, we’re happy to hear you enjoyed the drinks!We hope to see you again soon!",
      "What an awesome chic place.  Amazing craft cocktail & gastro pub style tapas.

      "The entrance to Spanglish is so subtle that it's easy to miss! Once you enter, the ambiance is cozy, intimate, and welcoming. We came because of the happy hour -- their cocktails were $9 and some small dishes were marked down! We ordered a round of the caipirinhas first and sadly were a bit disappointed, it was way more tart than expected and just tasted like lemon juice. The Chilcano tasted similar with the overpowering citrus. The Spanglish mule was way better! For small plates, we ordered the octopus croquettes, Caribbean dumplings, and a side of yuca. The octopus croquettes were my favorite of the items we ordered -- crispy, served hot, and the octopus inside was tender. The Caribbean dumplings were a little mushy, and the yuca was a bit tough and the sauce it was served with tasted like Big Mac sauce which I am not a fan of. Everything came out pretty fast, though!",
      "Finally got to visit Spanglish and let's just say I fell in love! I came here for happy hour with a friend and honestly we were blown away by how delicious everything was. We ordered the Spanish Milk Bread, Timba Frita, Queso E' Craba , and Tuna Tostadas. My favorite dish we tried was the Timbra Frita. It was the perfect bite full of flavor. We also ordered cocktails. We both ordered the Paparazzi which honestly tasted amazing but the presentation was killer. It comes served in a camera lens. Overall this place is a vibe. The music was lit. They were playing bad bunny. The artwork is awesome. I definitely see myself coming back here.",
      "Location a bit hidden in plain sight, so be sure to stop and read signs. Small  and intimate setting with a great ambiance for drinks and light bites with friends. The food was ok nothing over the top or extraordinary. I did like my margarita with the seafood bites. Drinks here before a walk around in Wynwood is never a bad idea.",
      "This place has no sign in front. We drive up and down and finally found it. Outside looks like it was closed. Nothing indicating it was opened except for a sign out front that shows menu of the day. We walked it and surprisingly was like wow. This is a cute small cozy restaurant.  The booth I say were pretty close to one another.  The bar area has 6 stools. The food was excellent! Extremely flavorful and so good. The octopus appetizer was amazing. We ordered one of their popular dish and weren't disappointed.  I forgot to photo that dish because I was so hungry.  Everything we had was great including the drinks. We love craft drinks and for sure it was super crafty. The paparazzi drink was so cute. It came in a camera cup and tasted great.I would be definitely coming back here again soon and recommend everyone to try if you haven't been here.",
      "Came here to try a few drinks on a Friday night and it wasn't as busy as I expected. I was able to sit at the bar and watch the bartender make these really cool looking and tasty drinks! The paparazzi was my favorite. Something about the dill and passion fruit combination was something I didn't know I needed. The vuela paloma was just okay, I'm just not the biggest fan of grapefruit. And the cafetera old fashioned tasted like a REALLY strong Cuban coffee, which I really enjoyed. Although the drinks were great, the vibe was kinda ruined by these drunk idiots sitting next to us at the bar, yelling and screaming. But I would still come here again to enjoy a cool curated cocktail."

      "Seaspice was amazing. It's a fantastic restaurant with a great view right on the Miami River. If you don't right you can catch the live music as the sun sets, and the restaurant transforms to a lounge. Totally worth coming Parking is tricky, and if you're not paying attention you might miss it as you drive by. But it's a gem worth coming back to.",
      "Seaspice is known to Miami locals as a very high end resturant, frequented by celebrities.  I have no idea why.  The service is pretty awful.  The drink runners are horrible.  It takes about 30 minutes for just a drink to be brought out to you.  The food is mediocre.  It is definitely NOT worth the price, which is very expensive.  I am giving two stars because the view is amazing.  Seaspice is right on the water and has a gorgeous ambiance.  You can watch yachts drive by and some will even pull up and park.  The other star is for the tres leches.  This dessert was AMAZING, I would go back just to eat it again.  But otherwise, Seaspice is nothing special.  Save your money.",
      "A place that tries to be high end but fails to deliver.Service ? Mediocre Food ? Below parFirst thing when you check in is they tell you that you have a 2 hr max(tacky)",
      "I read this was one of the best patio dining AND a hot spot for celebrities in Miami, so I had to go check it out on our recent travels to this area...Initially I was worried about our luggage situation, as we had to carry our luggage to the restaurant since this was our last stop in Miami. However, they were very accommodating, and let us store some of our stuff in the closet, and we kept the big luggage with us, near our table.As expected, the patio scene was spectacular...city skyline and seaside views, with plenty of yachts passing by! The place indeed had that chic celebrity vibe...truly FAB! Loved the music overhead as well. Somehow, I expected some snobbiness...but not at all. Service was great!Then the food. OMFG...I've had some amazing foods lately, but this takes the cake. Even the complimentary bread was amazing (and unique)! My husband ordered this Wagyu Burger, and I chose this Ragu Pappardelle ( THE best Ragu Pappardelle I've ever had...EVER. ). Then this Pavola dessert...again, just beyond delish. Truly, this was foods for the celebrities.Honestly, I'm shocked at how low the rating is for this place. I assume that if the service isn't top notch, it would probably piss some folks off. The pricing was on the outlandish side...with even lunch entrees starting at around 40. There was even an appetizer item priced at around 70 bucks! Luckily, like I said, I felt that the foods and the service (and especially the spectacular ambiance) made up for it. There was this big yacht parked right near us, which somewhat blocked some of the views from the left. Still, we got our eyeful of seaside/yachtside views.In any case, this was a great way to end our trip in Miami.",
      "Went here with a group of girlfriends for brunch and everything was delicious, they were super accommodating as well.I had the froze , a cucumber and gin cocktail and 2 grey goose and sodas and all were fantastic.As a table we split the fresh fish and a couple sides and it was delicious. Also love the free bread It is definitely on the pricier side overall tbh but great for a fun \"fancy\" brunch",
      "Came here for Miami spice and although we spent more than we thought we would, we had a good time. Everything was delicious. The kale Caesar had pecans and Granny Smith apple slices, never had a Caesar like this but it was a nice change! The Shrimp Pesto Whole Wheat Spaghetti was my favorite, even though I'm not the biggest fan of pesto. The burger was good too just a little messy from the truffle aioli. The chocolate cremoso and tres leches was very good but I'd go with the cremoso for the cocoa nib crumble, yum! All in all, I think it's overpriced and I probably won't come here again because of that. The cheapest bottle of Chardonnay was $75 and most drinks were $20. I only came here for Miami spice and still spent almost $200.",
      "Given we still have Miami Spice going on until the end of the month we decided to try out the lunch menu @ Seaspice gorgeous location on the Miami River, sitting outdoor is really relaxing, so beautiful to watch the boats go by, really lovely To start we had the Comte' Cheese Soufflé, I have to admit this was a bit disappointing, it really did not have the texture of a real soufflé  but then............ the Shrimp Pesto Whole Wheat Spaghetti and the Pan-Seared Chilean Seabass were really good as dessert, both the Tres Leches and the Chocolate Cremoso were yummy Try it out before Miami Spice ends, you can check out the Miami Spice Menus on miamiandthebeaches.com@seaspicemia",
      "First time for me at Seaspice, it is located on the banks of the Miami River it is a gem that you should not miss. Sit outside in the courtyard enjoy your food and a drinks while watching the boats go by, just beautiful We had the Miami Spice lunch which has a very affordable fix price 3 course menu for $ 28, unfortunately this will end soon, nevertheless, I would defiantly go back again for sureRegarding the Miami Spice menu only one observation, they should have had more than one choice for the Entrees without the extra charge, right now you have 4 choices and 3 of these have extra charge on it, not really fair given that you are promoting the Spice menu, you should have at least two or three choices included in the price and one or two with the extra charge We had had Prince Edward Island Mussels, Grilled, the Grilled Faroe Island Salmon and the Profiteroles and Peaches and Cream. My favorite where the Mussels, the garlic pizza bread they brought for the table was absolutely delicious, the Salmon was good too. I had the Peaches for dessert and it was ok, not really my thing, my friend said the Profiteroles were great, next time I will not opt for the healthy dessert We enjoyed all with a good Albariño wine, our experience was made especially enjoyable by our waiter Fabrizio, he was really great ! Thank you Fabrizio @seaspicemia",
      "Bad first impression. Its not a nice feeling to feel like you have to beg to spend your money at a restaurant. Every year I look forward to Miami Spice. It's a great way to try out various restaurants and a unique spread of menu options. Seaspice was on my radar and happened to be one of the participating restaurants offering the Miami Spice menu. I contacted the restaurant in advance and made a reservation for 3:30p for a party of four. My mom who is from out of town was excited to join us for lunch. I advised the restaurant we were doing the Miami Spice menu. The restaurant made it clear that they charge $50pp for No Shows. At 3:15pm, we arrived for our reservation. The hostess Karin greeted us, and advised us that they were running behind on the reservations and because of this they will not be able to offer the Miami Spice menu. Only the a la-carte menu will be offered. This was a bit upsetting because we drove almost an hour to get there and the restaurant is refusing to offer the Miami Spice promotion. Our natural instinct was to just say forget it we will go somewhere else. I mean, at the end of the day who wants to beg to spend their money? It's absurd. If the restaurant is offering a promotional menu and because to no fault of our own they are running behind why should we be penalized?My Mom looked so bummed out. Because she was so excited to try this place. I decided to walk back in and ask for a Manager. The Manager took 20min to come out. When he finally did come over, he introduced himself as Collin. I explained to him what was going on and it seemed as though he wasn't aware that the hostesses were turning Miami Spice customers away. He decided to make it right and advised Karin to honor the Miami Spice menu. Impressive! Things were turning around. Besides the encounter at the hostess stand, the restaurant is beautiful. It is situated on Miami's waterfront were you can view the million dollar yachts passing by. They also have docks for those interested in docking and dining. You can view the downtown city skyline which I am sure looks amazing at night.The food was excellent. The Miami Spice menu offered a three course lunch for $28. You have the choice of a starter (Kale Salad, Cheese Souffle, or White Gazpacho). A choice of entrees (Seabass, Chicken Breast, Shrimp Pesto Pasta, Wagyu Burger, or Plant Bowl). And a choice of dessert (Tres Leches or Chocolate Cremoso). They also offer the option to add a Glass of wine for and additional $12. I ordered the Comte Cheese Souffle, the Green Circle Farms Chicken Breast, and the Tres Leches. The others in my party ordered the Kale Salad, Gazpacho, and Seabass. For starters, My favorites were the Kale Caesar Salad and Cheese Souffle. The Kale Caesar had a mix of shredded Granny Smith apples, pecans and a creamy Caesar dressing. The cheese Souffle was like a fluffy egg Souffle with a cream parmesan sauce and tomato chutney. Delicious!For entrees, both the Seabass and Chicken breast were amazing. The Chicken breast was tender and juicy, served on top of a creamy polenta and topped with corn, peas, and mushrooms. The seabass was seared nicely to give a nice crunch on the outside, while perfectly flaky and moist on the inside. It was served with stewed garbanzo, Swiss chard, and smoked potato. For desserts, we all had Tres Leches. It was served in a small Mason jar topped with 3 milks, and berries. Perfect way to end the meal. The portions are not large but it is filling. The flavors are fresh and very well balanced. The food presentation was notable. The Watermelon Tequila drink was delightful and refreshing. The froze was also a big hit. The cocktails were presented well and created perfectly. We enjoyed everything. Our waiter, Austin was very friendly. He made great recommendations and was very attentive.An 18% gratuity was added to the tab. There are lots of street parking accessible. In the end, the food was great. Ambience was amazing. The hostesses can use additional customer service training and learn to use better judgment to improve the customers experience. There was no need to escalate the matters to a manager. It could have been handled properly by showing empathy, apologizing, and finding a solution to the problem.",
      "Hi Kim,Thank you for dining with us and leaving a detailed review. It has been forwarded to our management team. Our apologies for the confusion at the door.  Glad to hear Collin accommodated you and your experience was turned around.  We are happy to see your great feedback regarding the food, cocktails, and Austin’s Service.  Hopefully you will join us again in the near future!",
      "This is my second time going to sea spice & I normally love it as the first time. I never leave bad reviews But this second time MY PHONE WAS STOLEN AND SECURITIES DID NOThing about it. Instead we're trying to blame me for the situation. I'm not drunk nor was drunk. I walked in with 2 phone and walked out with 1.We came as my friend USUALLY does and this is how they treated us  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME. I thought it was 5 star so nothing could go wrong. With a security right next to our table my phone STILLL got stolen. It was on the table. And to whoever has the time to steal phones is just sad imagine what else they can steal... I wil ask to review cameras but with the way I was treated when I let them know I lost my phone I doubt they will be helpful but I'll let every platform form of review know that they steal phones here. I know the exact time frame as well so they wouldn't even have to look much at the cameras. Let's see. BTW I BEEN HOME SICK AFTER EATING THESE OYSTERS I COULDNT Even celebrate my baby's birthday w him.",
      "Came here for my birthday dinner with my boyfriend for a 7:15 reservation (we called in advance for an outdoor seat dock side) we waited about ten minutes after our arrival for our table to be ready at the bar, the short wait was definitely worth it. Started with an aperol spritz at the bar then ordered octopus and gazpacho to start. Octopus portion was good but the olive oil tasted burnt since it came out on a sizzling hot cast iron looking skillet (its very easy to overcook octopus, please just bring a regular plate next time.) I also had the whole main lobster. Extremely delicious large portion of perfectly cooked and seasoned lobster, bravo. My boyfriend had the truffle coated Chilean sea bass and he absolutely loved it. Vibe: 5/5 this place definitely is a scene but not overwhelmingly pretentious or obnoxious. Absolutely loved the music as well. Service:3/5 A bit slow, our server was very attentive when we were able to get his attention but we had to always wave him down. Food: 4/5 everything was honestly pretty good (octopus could've had a bit more attention to detail)",
      "Hi Liz,Thank you for celebrating your birthday with us!  We are so happy to hear you had a great experience and enjoyed the food.  Your feedback regarding the octopus has been sent to our chef. We look forward to seeing you again soon!"

      "Hands down my favorite restaurant in Miami. Ambiance is upbeat and intimate. Food is AMAZING does not miss in the year I've been going consistently. Service is outstanding .",
      "Amazing steakhouse Our favorite was the the Australian Wagyu which I can only say was perfection. their sides were so perfectly complimentary. Truffle Mac and cheese, the Brussels sprouts, spinach, broccolini and cauliflower were excellent. Beef lettuce wraps were decent, beet salad was good, kids meals were devoured. ALSO if you're here for breakfast their buffet is great",
      "WOW - To say I was completely blown away by my first time dining here would be an understatement. Whether you're celebrating a special occasion or just craving a delectable meal that will leave you speechless, this is the spot that will be sure to leave a lasting impression. From the lavish and trendy decor, the out of this world dishes, beautiful presentations and impeccable service, every detail was taken well into consideration and perfected.I can say with certainty that this is one of the most gorgeous spaces I've ever eaten a meal in. The sultry vibe, elegantly designed interior, endless display of wine bottles scattered throughout the restaurant and the stunning bar will have you feeling like you're in the midst of dining amongst celebrities. There didn't seem to be a bad table to dine at in sight, but my parents and I were lucky enough to snag one of the beautiful half-moon booths toward the center of the room. When is the last time you've been to a restaurant that brings complimentary French fries to the table? And not just any regular ole' French fries, but a delicious trio of French fries each complimented by their own unique dipping sauce? Bet it's probably never happened before, unless you've eaten here. I thought this was such a neat but simple touch that really set them apart from other high-end restaurants. They also bring yummy rolls topped with sea salt to the table (between the fries & the bread, you might end up in a food coma before you even order if you're not careful). I ordered the tuna tartar for an appetizer and I was in heaven every time I took a bite. Not only does it melt in your mouth, but the presentation alone is enough reason to order this (the way they mix it for you makes for a fun video opportunity if you have your phone ready to record). My parents shared a shrimp cocktail that they both enjoyed - The shrimp were massive! Following the appetizers, I munched on a cesar salad which was perfectly dressed. Now... the STEAK. Holy moly, one of the best filet mignons I have had yet. It was ridiculously flavorful, tender & juicy. Melted in your mouth and bursted with flavor. If you're a steak lover, it would be a crime to come here and not order it. The mashed potatoes that accompanied it were also flavorful, but I thought they were a little too runny (my only complaint of the whole meal). If you're a fan of grilled onions, do yourself a favor and order a side of these to top your steak with and thank me later. The \"Smoked Chocolate S'mores\" dessert was ridiculously decadent and was the perfect finish to an impeccable meal. Yes, it's insanely pricy and yes, it's totally worth it. My experience here was one of the best dining experiences I've ever had in Miami - And that says a lot given the fact that Miami is one of the hottest spots in the country for foodies. This restaurant hit it out the park for me and I'm already searching for an excuse to go back to South Florida and to savor new dishes on their menu.",
      "The restaurant is spacious and nice. Bar is nice as well.Staff was friendly and attentive.For appetizers the tuna tartare was fresh and seasoned well.They also bring you French fries 3 different ways with 3 different sauces. I had the certified Angus rib cap cooked medium rare and It was good and flavorful. The side of Mac and Cheese was good as well.",
      "Our favorite was the the Australian Wagyu which I can only say was perfection.",
      "Ambiance was awesome. The dishes, coctails and the dessert were so delicious. All the employees were so polite and friendly. They celebrated our honeymoon with a cute card, it was so nice.They made our special day unforgettable.",
      "Wonderful experience! Fabulous service. Timing, everything was a 10.  Our server really made our night fabulous, she was awesome. Great steak, Mac and cheese with truffle was really nice. Molten cake was super good as well. I must say everything was impeccable.",
      "Phenomenal cuisine. Never have a enjoyed such a succulent and flavourful sea bass - it is one of their renowned specials. But the lack of bones in the fish was made up for by the pained bones in my rear.The decor was beautiful but very far from comfortable. The low chairs were too uncomfortable for eating. The benches; built for slaves.The overall experience was truly hampered by a god awful designer deserving of life in prison for her domestic terror on comfort. 4/5 not bad",
      "This plus is amazing! We had a private room & our server was Erin. Erin was very pleasant, patient, informative & very professional. She suggested several appetizers & dinner. It was our first time visiting this restaurant & it definitely won't be our last.",
      "Food was incredible. I love that when you get to the table instead of getting some bread you get french fries. Service was also impeccable and ambiance is very family friendly in my opinion"

      "What a great place. Food was awesome!! Found this place through a food bloggers Instagram and had to try it. Can't wait to go back and try other items on the menu. Had the chicken taco, mac and cheese and cole slaw. Fast service, friendly & welcoming people.",
      "Went to Hometown twice in a couple weeks and tried at least half their menu, so I won't steer you wrong. 1) If you're sharing a meal with at least 1 other person or if you are a true bbq fan and don't mind having a crap ton of food and taking home leftovers, order the beef rib. It was just as rich and delicious as the beef ribs I had in Austin-- soo tender and fatty, like butter, and just as huge. It could have fed 4 people. 2) If you want a smaller portion, get the brisket. It was also very tender, fatty, ugh so good. Other menu items are also good, but beef rib or brisket are MUST ORDERS. Ok, onto other menu items. The pulled pork sandwich was yummy, if you prefer pork and/or want a sandwich. I'm sure their brisket sandwich would be good too, because the brisket is good.Pastrami bacon was delicious but be warned it comes drizzled in a mustard sauce, in case you dislike mustard. The cornbread was good with the honey butter. The watermelon salad was ok. Good to have some greens and something cold and refreshing to balance out the richness of the bbq. The broccoli was also just ok. Nice big portion, but pretty standard broccoli. Again, mainly good to have some vegetables for balance. The Cole slaw is good for Cole slaw. I would skip the char siu ribs unless you love Chinese meat because they were pretty dry. The Korean rib tips were also surprisingly flavorless, so skip. The Mac and cheese was mediocre. Service is fast and the space is big with indoor and outdoor seating and tvs. Happy to have texas quality bbq in Miami!",
      "Their review was way overdue; I had already visited this place twice in the past and was not left disappointed. Over the weekend, I went again! From what I remember when I had visited before, the food was absolutely delicious, but I didn't recall the customer service, but I must say everyone who we came across was so amicable. We were greeted and told to sit where we wanted soon as we stepped in, our waiter came shortly with two waters in advance, took our order once we were ready and did warn us it was a lot of food we were ordering for two -- BUT whats better than not cooking dinner on a Friday night?! Not having to cook dinner on Saturday either!! We ordered the Beef Rib ($54), 1/2 Brisket ($20), Mac & Cheese ($11 Large portion), 6 smoked wings ($14), and one piece of cornbread ($7). For drinks, I ordered a Mezcal Grapefruit Cocktail ($15) and my partner had a Woodford on the rocks ($16)..  The food including my cocktail was fabulous!! The only negative remark I'll make is for the wings, the dry rub way-too-smoky taste was not my favorite; nevertheless, this place is definitely worth a try or two :9 we also got a hat to support!! Oh and tip: when heating the leftovers, put it in the oven!!! Do not microwave it!! :D",
      "I don't go out of my way for BBQ often but if I'm craving it- this is the spot we go to. Its tucked away in allapattah so can he confusing to find the first time around.Servings are big and I recommend sharing with a group so you can try everything. The wings, brisket, ribs, and pulled pork are all phenomenal. For sides I recommend the mac and cheese and the cornbread. Service is fast and friendly and sometimes on the weekend they have live music on the patio too!",
      "I was not expecting an Asian twist with ribs. They are good in their own way. The watermelon salad was phenomenal. The max and cheese was traditional and delicious. I could eat a gallon of the stuff. The ribs were good! I was looking more towards moist, fall off the bone, saucy ribs. These were although moist, a little drier than traditional ribs.",
      "I absolutely love it here! I just left Superblue with my boyfriend and we decided to stop here Sunday afternoon. It was crowded but the line went by pretty quick and our food delivered to table quickly as well. We ordered drinks and had a blast! I definitely recommend! They play World Cup games and play good music!",
      "We love coming here!!! It's a bit pricey but you eat so well and there's always left overs ! I love the brisket and don't forget the corn bread! The Cheddar jalapeño sausage is also a delicious surprise! Totally recommend!",
      "Food is AMAZING ! Worth the trip. Not the best of areas A little sketchy during the day. One could only imagine at night. Oddly enough the best places are \"Hidden Gems\" . This is one of them!",
      "Laid back, authentic vibe bbq place. Then meat quality was exceptional. The sides were underwhelming to average. Overhyped broccoli. Average beans. Good cornbread, even though that's been historically hit or miss for me. The short rib tips and Turkey blt really shined though. You pay at the counter and self seat. Some people did come by to help clean up and present you with your tray. It's casual. The bbq sauce on the table was great.",
      "Hello Yelpies!Finally returned to Hometown BBQ, specifically because I wanted to introduce my fiance to this gem of a place! This timw, I sat inside and it was great! The food was impressive once again! We ordered the wings again (5/5), the elote (3/5) just ok, now wow factor, BUT THE BRISKET?! O M G !  We ordered the Briskey taco and it was amazing! Truly the best brisket I've tried this far! the tortilla was in house made and the tacos itself was filled with an explosion of flavors that very well complemented the brisket. SO GOOD! We even spoke to the chef - Adrian and he was kind enough to show us where/how they cook all the meats. The place is so cute and cozy and the staff is fantastic as well. I made a clip on my new IG review page & invite you to check it out and follow : follow_the_reviewer",
      "Riding on the train to work, I always wondered what \"this place\" was but I never took my car to work, so I was never able to go, that is until this past Tuesday. Unfortunately for me, dinning in wasn't an option (due to COVID), but it sure looks very pretty, cozy and clean. So I ordered some take-out. Truly everything on the menu sounded delicious, and the cashier (very friendly) recommended any of the sandwiches, but on this day I went with the smoked wings. Odd choice, for a person that ONLY eats wings from Sports Grill and nothing else - also, I only eat grilled wings.  I waited 5-8 mins and and poof, they were ready! The wings were perfect. The presentation was immaculate, the sauces (bbq and another) were flavorful but light, the wings were cooked entirely and had a distant smoked flavor. Everything tasted very \"homemade\" and as \"whole food\" as possible and not greasy at all. I'm very happy with my visit and will be returning. :)  Con?? 6 wings for 12 bucks seems higher than usual, but it isn't an obnoxious amount either, and was well worth it.",
      "Still really good barbecue. Kind of expensive - a 1/2 rack of baby back  runs $32 buuuucks. American.1/2 a chicken is $22.1 taco $12, a pork sammy$16.1 beef rib $54.Wow.Don't get me wrong, the food is great, but that's not working man, go there for lunch kinda prices.The Frito Pie was the smash when they opened. It was rib tips, then they went to pulled pork, and today it was ground beef in a cheese sauce. But it's still$10.Oh yea, good luck with the parking.Taint none.",
      "Still the bomb, but it seams like the Frito pie now has ground beef instead of burnt ends. The menu says \"brisket queso\"...But whatever, not the same as before.. Good mind you, but not the same.They now have cocktails and a good beer list...Still a bang up joint",
      "The best thing I have eaten in the last 10 years, hands down. Chef musta been stoned to the bone when he invented the Frito Pie, but God danggit son, ya done good. Fritos, burnt ends, pickled onions, queso and Mexican crema. Kick Ass.I also have had the rib tips, nice little ribbies in an Asian glaze... Mmm sticky icky.Going back soon... !!!!"

The beat hummus, the regular hummus the our main meal we got a little bit of everything too. My favorite plate would have to be the the beef dumplings or the pistachio dessert. Service was great as well. Love the little out door market setting. Great place to come with family. Tea ‍Coffee ‍‍‍‍‍",

      "Sorry to hear that. Our tea is 3 USD. Sandwiches are between 14 to 17 USD and salads are 14-15 USD. We believe that we are well priced. We will aways look forward to serve you again.",
      "Eating here was an unexpected treat! We had no reservation for lunch but we were able to get in on Sunday for lunch. We shared the kopoglu, cheese salad, shrimp casserole. All delicious, interesting and super tasty. This was a surprise treat for us! Plus the atmosphere is whimsical, cool and tropical.",
      "What an amazing way to start off the day in this hidden gem of a Cafe. As you make your way in, you're immediately transported into a tropical oasis. I could go on and on about the food (the breakfast platter and pastries are *chef's kiss*), but my favorite part of the morning was watching a black cat sneak around the outdoor tables looking for treats. He seemed to be a regular based on waitress' exclamation of \"Ah! You again!\" before shooing him away.",
      "We are glad you liked our food and ‘the cat’ infact there is another one which is brown and adorable too.Cats are very common in the streets of Istanbul . We love cats. Dogs too.Please come again so that we can serve you the rest of our menu",
      "Make reservations as it can get busy on weekends. The outdoor seating is super cute. There's also a covered area that you can have seating but it's not as cute. Keep in mind there is no alcohol served currently. Our waitress mentioned you can BYOB ( there's wine and beer available to purchase at another restaurant next door but a bottle of wine will run $60) The food could definitely be better or have more options.The manti was great and we used to yogurt sauce as a dip for the simit bread (highly recommend) Doner wrap was fairly good in flavor just super dry.The eriste was bland definitely do not recommend The Gozleme was basically a Turkish quesadilla. Pretty good but again was kind of dry. I would definitely go back as it's a restaurant in my neighborhood and a great place for a chill night.",
      "I only tried two dishes. Doner Pilav and kunefe. Dinner Menu is small. The plate tasted like chopped grilled hot dog. Below average dinner menu. No Lamb. No Adana. No Kebab. Atmosphere and staff is nice. Food is average. Kunefe was dry. I will try breakfast next time. The place is in a very beautiful spot.",
      "I have been in this restaurant so  many times, I can't believe I haven't write a review. This was my first time trying Turkish food and it did not disappoint. Their dishes are presented as small tapas, so if you are really hungry your bill will be pricey.From the dishes I remembered, the outstanding ones were the beet hummus, lentil soup and Mediterranean salad sans the feta cheese. Also, a dish named Kisir was good. Overall, no too many vegan options.With good weather this place is a must. Charming Upper Buena Vista always a win."

The tomato bread is DELICIOUS.The price is a little high however expected for Miami Beach. I would definitely return .The waiter was also very friendly and nice :)",

Someone came over to help pick out our wine, bread was at our table within minutes and the server was able to answer all of our questions on the menu. I hate to say it but the lemon cheesecake was the star of the night. One of the best desserts any of us have had.",
      "Carbone Miami is Carbone NYC's slightly more flamboyant sibling. It doesn't look like much from the outside, but once you walk in you immediately feel like you're in a special place. The atmosphere, the finishings, the seating, the staff all make you feel like you're in for an experience (with an expected twist of grand Miami flair) - and you are. The food is good; favorites were the table-side prepared Caesar salad, spicy rigatoni (their staple item, although it wasn't spicy), the veal parmesan and whole branzino. So the important question, is it worth it? Yes and no. It is, genuinely, a great experience. It's just not something I feel the need to run back to. For the amount of money you'll pay by the night's end, the food was great but not so great that you'll miss it. So, like the NYC location, the biggest draw to dining at Carbone is being able to say you've been to Carbone.",
      "I did all my research and was practically ready to submit my order along with my reservation! That's how excited I was to dine at Carbone Miami. Parking- street parking or valet for $20 both which you can pay on your phone. My friends and I got patio seating because it was the only option while reserving. The patio is quiet and allows good conversation. While visiting inside it did seem a bit louder, but very beautiful. Service was amazing as expected. Friendly and knowledgeable staff who are great at recommendations and elevating your dining experience.The drinks menu is extensive and there is a sommelier making rounds to help with your choice. There are options for all budgets so take your time.Now the food! I must mention that the complimentary bread basket, pickled cauliflower, wedge of Parmesan and salami is enough to keep me coming back but they have way more to offer. The tomato and fresh mozzarella salad was fresh and absolutely perfect. We ordered two pasta dishes-- spicy rigatoni and lobster ravioli. Get both, you won't regret it. Also ordered the ribeye with a side of truffle creamed corn and potatoes. The ribeye had a delicious sauce but was tough/too fatty which is strange. I would skip next time. The creamed corn was amazing and the potatoes were crunchy and baked to perfection. You would think we would be too stuffed for dessert but we came on a mission and did not skip it. The hazelnut chocolate cake was decadent and truly a perfect companion to a espresso martini to end the night. All in all-- Carbone was a great success and I can't wait to be back to try other items on their menu. Reserve your table, do your research and be ready to splurge on a delicious meal.",
      "We ate here three days ago and my brain is still trying to figure out what the heck the weird flavor was on the lobster.  It was so bazaar ... and not in a good way.  At least at our table no one would finish it. The whole experience was weird.  It took forever for them to bring things.  Weird textures in odd places.  Idk we will not be back.  From the prices they charge I'm sure they won't be missing us.",

This is more of a seen and be seen restaurant.Antipasti:Burrata & Caviar - 3/5Mom's Meatball - 4/5Macaroni:Spicy Rigatoni Vodka - 4/5Dessert:Cheesecake - 4/5Everything was just okay. Nothing really stood out as amazing. The service is great and my waiter was super helpful. The burrata and caviar is laughable, it came with a hidden $125 price tag. Definitely not worth it. The pasta was good, the meatball okay but a little undercooked. Cheesecake was okay. I guess I can say I've been to Carbone now...",
      "This is a \"seen and be seen\" kind of place. It's definitely not the best Italian food but it's more for the ambience and people watching. The spicy rigatoni is pretty good. I would stick with the pastas on the menu. I ordered the ribs with cherry peppers. I didn't like it at all. I also wasn't a fan of the desserts. What Italian spot doesn't have tiramisu!?!?! The octopus is pretty good. I did enjoy the experience as the service is 10/10. I wouldn't mind coming back but just for the pasta, antipasto and drinks.",
      "My personal favorite restaurant in Miami. EVERYTHING and i mean everything is so delicious. From their bread basket to their dessert this place kills it.",
      "No baby strollers allowed, no high chairs provided! Do not recommend for any families with babies or toddlers. They have a very strict NO STROLLER policy. Although they do not mention this online, nor do they mention it on any of their reservation texts (where they do mention dress code), we were greeted with these unfortunate news when we arrived. As you can imagine, it was not welcoming or accommodating at all. And if it weren't for the time of our reservation (10 pm) we probably would've gone else where. Felt very unwanted and discriminated. They expect you to have a specific type of stroller and if you don't you're out of luck. We at least got seated to a corner booth, of course at that booth there was enough room for our stroller but it's apparent that this restaurant just isn't baby/child friendly.We came in with our baby sleeping in the stroller, thankfully we have a very calm and well behaving baby. But when we were told about this policy we did have to wake our baby up and then once we were seated we had to take turns with the baby because of this policy.Wouldn't come here again. Would warn any friends with new families about coming here and their stroller policy. Very interesting how when I went online to look up their no stroller policy I found an anti discrimination policy, and that was exactly how their staff made us feel. Discriminated against for going to their restaurant with a baby/child. I wouldn't take my baby to a bar but considering carbone is a restaurant I didn't think a baby would be an issue. I also wonder how accommodating they are to handicap people, considering our stroller could've fit if we took away a chair from our table. But again, the managers and staff were not accommodating so if we would've mentioned that option they would've just told us no and shown us the door.Thanks for the memorable birthday dinner celebration carbone!",
      "This is my absolute favorite Italian restaurant.  The spicy rigatoni is to die for!  Lobster ravioli, carpaccio and branzino is very delicious too.  The Miami location is beautiful, makes you feel like you're in the mid-20th century; it's so glamorous.  They play oldies which I love!  Carbone will always be a timeless hot spot for me."

I had high expectations after seeing all of the positive reviews prior to coming here. I was excited to try the lemonade because it's made the way I like it. Once I tried it I was very disappointed it seemed to have a very watered down taste. We had also got guacamole and pico de gallo as an appetizer and the guacamole seemed to only have avocado in it there was nothing else added. When my food came I was super excited. My fajitas was lacking a lot of chicken. It had way more peppers and onions than it did chicken. The rice was a bit dry. I really wanted to have a more positive experience when coming here",
      "This is great place to grab authentic wholesome Mexican food! The enchiladas verdes con pollo was amazing! As were the vegetarian enchiladas. Margaritas tasted wonderful, and a good selection of beers too! I want to point out how awesome the staff was. They went to extreme efforts to make sure they can find tables for our group of 15 people! The restaurant was packed but they gave great service.",
      "Ordered the Tacos Al Pastor, the meat was very dry. I was a bit disappointed as this dish is supposed to be their most popular. My husband ordered their special which was the Enchiladas Suizas, which was very good. The green sauce was amazing. Their chips with salsa was not a good starter. The salsa was bland, no taste, the chips were okay, which they salted it after it came out of the fryer at the least. We also ordered the queso fundido as an appetizer but that too was a let down. Not sure why so many people gave this place high ratings. I think it's one of those tourist trap places in Little Havana.",
      "The most authentic Mexican food in all of Miami. Definitely come here for the food! We walked out with a belly full of delicious food...and beer. They even have a Vegetarian section which can obviously be vegan-ized, like I did - hold the cheese, and so on.",
      "This tiny place in little Havana hits the spot when you have Mexican food cravings... last night i tried enchiladas de mole, really good and my friend had chilaquiles verdes de pollo... our dishes were overall pretty good & generous portions..service was also good despite being quite busy! The server let us try samples of the tamarindo and jamaica drinks- both pretty good as well.  Keep in mind there is a little bakery inside the restaurant- cash only, try the 'pan de elote'.",
      "Great Mexican food on Calle Ocho? Sign me up. Chicken con mole and pozole were quite good, and the combo platter is a great value. Extensive menu and casual, nice ambience for a quick stop or family sit-down."

      "WET is a solid spot to take friends or clients for a night out, food quality is some of the best I've had in Miami and it shows. I love that they have dancers and aerialists as well to tie the place together.What really makes this place special to me though is the service, from ownership down to the servers, every single person has a smile on their face and is ready to have some fun while serving great food in an upscale atmosphere.Have come here many times since it's opening and will continue to bring friends here.",
      "Aesthetically appealing but pretentious and uncourteous. Made a 5:30 rez after a Basel event. I was wearing dress pants and a dress shirt with fine leather sandals. Walked up to an empty restaurant only to be greeted by a hostess who looked at my feet and immediately said \"I need to go ask my manager if you can come in because I don't want to get in trouble.\" Waited another 5 minutes for her to come out and say \"my manager says you can't come in because you're in open toed shoes and you're a guy.\"We laughed because she's telling me this while the hostess behind her is in a tennis skirt and sneakers and the \"Basel Artist\" they were hosting was painting in paint splattered vans and a t shirt. Manager made the determination without even coming outside to assess the situation. If I'm planning to pay 400.00+ for dinner, I don't appreciate being judged blindly.... No where on the website is a dress code indicated. Don't bother stopping in and head to Sexy Fish where they actually practice what they preach .",
      "This restaurant is located in the Brickell area. There is valet parking in the front and self- parking in the back. Keep in mind self- parking is not free. We came here as a party of 5 for our monthly girl's night out! We heard of this new restaurant that just opened,  so we made a reservation. One thing I will say is that .. our reservation was for 7, however we were an hour late due to the traffic on the highway...  and they still honored our reservation. Service was great! Our waiter was attentive, funny and kind..  once we were done eating someone came almost immediately to clear the table.. I ordered the crab cake as an appetizer and the lobster Ravioli.... The crab cake was average and the lobster ravioli did not taste like it had lobster in it..  This restaurant has a nice ambiance. The music is loud and there is also a show.. people do dress up. There are a few places for pictures, so get that camera ready!Inside the restaurant is nicely decorated with an under the sea theme..  the menu offers a variety of foods and really expensive wagyu beef..Overall, it was a good night however, I do feel that this restaurant is way overpriced.",
      "Made reservations for 7pm on a Sunday was really looking forward to this place after seein so many people come here and posting on social media we get here place looks like is closed and dark we waited outside for 5 mins before someone saw us and came outside to take us in we went in and were the only people here they sat us down service was fast drinks were good food was okay nothing out of this world this place opens at 5pm and no one was there no music it was no energy didn't like it this place and won't recommend it they need to do a little better I rather sexy fish that's up the street",
      "Wow, what an experience! The food was delicious while the presentation was spectacular! We got the best table in the house, the performance was right in front and it was breath taking to say the least. The cocktails was so tasty, all my girls enjoyed their night! The service was top notch, I can't thank my server enough for making it a wonderful experience for everyone at the table. I'm happily recommending to all my friends as one of the best dinner and a show",
      "To start with, the ambience is absolutely beautiful. They did some food items really well like the raw oysters; some of the best I've ever had to be honest! The wagyu bao, the Brickell roll, lobster ricotta ravioli were good. The oceanos seafood pasta lacked any flavor... I was actually surprised. I expected it to be flavorful with the array of seafood it contains. We had the waiter taste the sauce and even he agreed. The service was great. I probably wouldn't go back, I love the experience but dislike that thought of paying those prices for basic \"good\" food. At those prices i think all the food should be amazing.",
      "This place was horrible. Go to Sexy Fish instead, WET was way way wayyy too expensive you can't even find the prices online before you go. Prices are nowhere to be found and that's probably because they don't want you to cancel your reservation. We were a big group and 2 people were running late so the staff decided that we weren't allowed to sit at our table until every person got there. The \"show\" was a wall... because that's all you can see from most of the tables not to mention how small the restaurant is. I am never coming back here ever again and neither should you!",
      "Very nice ambiance. The drinks were really good and I enjoyed the pasta. My server, can't remember his name, but he used to be a jeweler(?), he was awesome! I would def go back. A little pricey, but a vibe. Next time I'd go at night so I can see the aerialist.",
      "If the fish was any fresher, we will be eating it on the boat. Without a doubt one of the best sushi restaurants in Miami, the quality of the food was amazing. The staff were great. It's a bit pricey but I can understand. If we want fresh sushi it's worth ever dim. Great ambience. There are some many great dishes. I can't recommend  one outstanding dish there were so many. Go have fun.",
      "Ok let's start with the appetizers the creamy corn is delicious the Salmon tartar not so much it doesn't taste so fresh. The main plates like the King crab is expensive and there is nothing king about it, now why did I give it 4 stars well it was the service it was simply first class they did not miss a beat I felt like a queen and it is not comparable to the finest restaurants it goes beyond that therefore they get the 4 stars and I will be back."

      "Italian top of the line restaurant. this was an incredible meal, A nice casual, italian restaurant indoor.We started with a mushroom carpaccio and a tuna tartare then we ate the caccio de pepe. Pasta  was cooked perfectly you will need to make reservations prior, place was full.if you want to find delicious caccio de pepe, look no further than this place. i have only heard good things about this place. great for a date or for a night out with friends",
      "Sapore di Mare is located in the grove. We came Sunday night without a reservation, as it was our first time, and decided to eat here thanks to the great reviews it has. The restaurant is small and cozy so it can get a bit crowded but the host/owner(?) was very polite and found us a table. This place has delicious food that includes perfectly Al dente pasta made in-house, a great assortment of fresh fish and seafood, and attentive service.We ordered the burrata & prosciutto di Parma for starters. We also ordered the Impepata di Cozze, two Tagliolini Sapore di Mare, Agnolotti di Fico and the tagliolini Nero e capesante. The food was outstanding! Al-dente pasta with super fresh seafood. Perfectly seasoned and delicious!! The burrata was fresh and the prosciutto melted in your mouth. The mussels were plenty, fresh, and super delicious Definitely give it a try!",
      "Third time here.Make the reservation already!!!Whattya waiting for?This place is tops.See Vincent, tell him I sent you.Ask about the off menu items. Hint hint.Everything is so fresh, impeccable service.Clean tableware, glasses, attention to detail.I'll be back soon!!",
      "Wow, wow, oh friggin wow.Waited a long time to come here.Seemed too busy, I don't know.Now I'm kicking myself for not coming sooner.Very extensive menu. You're not going to see this stuff this side of the Atlantic, my friend.I've been to Eyetaly a couple times, this place is so close to an Amalfi or Sorento 10-15 seat cafe/restaurant/osteria as you can get.Veal tonnato was off the chain.Pasta with urchin!!???? Oh my sweet Jesus was this delicious.The wife had the Prawns and salad. Huge Prawns.Veronica is the Boss here, she runs a very tight ship mis amigos.Can't wait to go back.",
      "Very cute Italian eatery. I came here for lunch, and the food was pretty good, and the wine list was diverse. Had both the burrata and the carpaccio de carne, both of which were very tasty and refreshing. Also had their pasta that was tossed in a cheese wheel which was really creamy but a little to heavy for me and definitely needed salt. It took a long time to even get water and order food, but the service was fair. Nobody really paid attention to us. I felt serving cookies with the cappuccino was a great touch.",
      "Came for a late Christmas Day dinner. They were closing at 930 and we arrived at like 9 but they were very accommodating. I had the cacio e pepe and it was the BEST one I've had. They mix is in a large parmesan cheese bowl at the table. For appetizer we shared the prosciutto and burrata and it was amazing. The prosciutto and mozzarella were perfect. The waiter was really nice and patient with my questions. Would definitely recommend!!",
      "THE BEST ITALIAN RESTAURANT IN MIAMI! Just come here and prove it for yourself! All the seafood is super fresh, pasta is perfectly done, staff super friendly and desserts decadent. Super worthy to give a try and enjoy delicious Italian food, try to make reservations since the place is very small",
      "Came here on a Saturday around noon for lunch. Had a reservation just in case it would be too busy, but there was plenty of room at noon. The chalkboard has their specials, which were explained in detail by our server; otherwise they have their paper menu for the food, and the digital kindle-like menu for the wines. I appreciate any place for complimentary bread, but especially love that place when it's good. Got complimentary focaccia for the table--warm, soft, and perfectly seasoned. Got the sparkling water ($7), tagliatelle al ragu ($24), and the risotto special ($39). The tagliatelle al ragu ($24): really shows how a basic dish could be great quality. The pasta had that perfect texture of being slightly firm but tender.The risotto special ($39): definitely stood out to me since it had half of a lobster. What really stood out to me was the creamy seafood sauce that was rich and filled with flavor. Definitely worth trying. Also if you are driving to get here, I'd avoid the parking lot across the street (still paybymobile) because I ended up paying ~$10 for 90 minutes--and only 30 minutes would have been $5. The parallel parking nearby is cheaper ($3/hr) so definitely would recommend that instead.The staff and environment were warm and inviting, adding to a fantastic eating experience. Overall, great quality Italian food, and good service! Will definitely return in the future!",
      "We love this gem in Coconut Grove. Everyone is always so happy inside and the service is exceptional. The pasta is just wow! It's soft and melts in your mouth. We loved them all. The sapore do mare pasta dish was our favorite. 10/10 recommend this spot.",
      "There isn't too many great Italian places around and it's mainly because Sapore Di Mare far surpasses any other option. This is my go to and possibly favorite restaurant in the Grove. The ambiance and atmosphere is super relaxing and inviting. The host and business owner is incredible and super engaging with all the guests. There is usually live music but if not there is great jazz and/or classic Italian music playing which makes you feel as if your sitting countryside along the Italian coast. The breadbasket is delicious and sets the tone for your food experience. Super soft and tasty. I recommend dipping into olive oil and balsamic vinegar. For dinner, we got the Lobster Ravioli and the Truffle Pasta cheese wheel. Super delicious. We wanted more! 5 stars all the way. This is the place to go! Buon appetite",
      "My girlfriend and I had been looking forward to coming here since before the pandemic, but for one reason or another the schedule never clicked. Maybe the universe was trying to tell us something. Service was definitely lacking. The restaurant was busy, but that didn't stop our waiter from schmoozing with all the pretty girls. It got to the point where we watched our food get delivered to another table while he was flirting with a blonde dressed like she was going clubbing afterwards.The food is mediocre at best. There's better flavor in a box of frozen lasagna than with any of the appetizers we ordered. Zucchini flowers tasted like they'd been dipped in Elmer's paste and fried in motor oil. Their veal chop is brutally fried and served tasting like breaded cardboard. I'm sure if there's some way for them to screw up a salad, they'd do it.This place is a must pass...."

There are no reservations-- but if you come at rush hour time just can grab a drink and catch up with friends on the sidewalk. There is no waiting area, there is no designated anything. You just wait and be glad you're there. Once seated please note you have one opportunity to get all your order in. So do your research and come prepared. You will enjoy anything you order so no pressure!Highly recommend this unexpected gem in Little Havana.",
      "My party and I arrived at 5 on the dot and were allowed in immediately. The Service: The service was decent. You scan the QR code to check out the menu and then order with the server. Each table could only order once, and honestly, that's about it in terms of service. You'll see the server once when you order and then when you ask for the check. The table we sat at wasn't all that practical. It was tilted towards the middle, so our drinks kept sliding to the middle of the table, where there were gaps, resulting in the drinks spilling over. The Food: I had walked into the restaurant with high expectations after reading the raving reviews the restaurant had on Yelp..... but after trying the food, I was a bit underwhelmed. The portions were small, and the taste just didn't meet my expectations. The crab fried rice was too salty, the thai tea too sweet (sweetness was not adjustable). I enjoyed the crab and pork dry noodles, the pad see ew, and the papaya salad, but they were not as mind-blowing as I had expected.Overall, pretty decent food in a hole-in-the-wall restaurant, but unfortunately, it did not live up to the hype.",
      "EXCELLENT restaurant. Most of the time you have to wait at least 30min but it is worth the wait. Everything we ordered was great, especially the duck salad, the noodles and the rice. Service was also very good. The only bad thing is that you can only order once, and the music sucks. Will definitely keep coming back. Prices are reasonable.",
      "Come prepared for a bit of a wait. It is absolutely worth it! I have yet to find better Thai food in Miami... the food speaks for itself. The staff is very friendly and helpful as well with recommendations. I've been here a couple of times and have always had a wonderful time with no hiccups.",

      "It's off Calle-Ocho(SW 8th St), didn't even know there was this mom & pop style Thai place in Little Havana. Good luck with street parking or take an Uber. 5 of us came here for lunch, it's a very small place, a few tables on the sidewalk out front, about 5 tables in the patio area, maybe a few inside at the counter. They will not seat you until everyone in your group has arrived. We were able to get the big table, it's like a picnic table. We looked over the menu, they have a lot of your favorite Thai dishes that include noodles, soups, salads, rice dishes, curries, and a few specialty dishes. Everything looked pretty good, it was about 90 degrees outside, so I decided to keep it on the cool side and got the \"Somtam\"(papaya salad) with a side of crispy Spring Rolls. Also, I tend to try out a traditional staple dish to gauge the place for future visits.  Papaya salad seemed to be freshly made, good flavor, and perfect for the hot weather, they didn't blow it up with chilis but I'm sure they could if you asked. Spring Rolls was crisp, nicely fried up and perfect lunch pair.  If I remember, I think everyone else got either a rice or noodle dish. They seemed to enjoy it and no issues from anyone. At least for our lunch visit, it's not a huge portion but it was just right in my book. Didn't feel like it wasn't enough or feel jipp'd.  Mom & pop style, noodle and rice dishes served in a bowl like your Thai grandma would give you.  Overall, glad to have come check them out, service was fine, my co-workers enjoyed it, prices aren't crazy, some of us talked about this place being a good take-out place to take dinner home, well we work nearby so yea I can see that. They have a rule you can only order once, you can't keep adding more food to your table sitting.  Scan bar code if you want to see the menu.",

      "I love lung yai. You have to get here early or expect to wait though. It is small but they are fast and tune tables quickly. When you order you have to make sure you order all at once. You CANNOT order after (not even dessert). First time I went I thought I was in a Seinfeld episode. No more food for you! Lol. It's great though. Recommend.",

      "I eat sushi all over the world and not only were the dishes fresh and the correct temperature but the presentation and overall flavor profiles were out of this world. I had the crispy rice flight and a few hand rolls which were all amazing! The chef even made me a special off the menu mushroom truffle dumpling which was to die for!!! Service was attentive and professional and the ambiance was very relaxed with an authentic Japanese feel. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for quality, fresh sushi in a pinch! I live in Palm Beach and I will be back for sure!!!",
      "This is one probably my favorite restaurants at this time. It is a flawless experience. From how welcoming staff is to how delicious everything is.I recommend this place without any hesitation. You will enjoy every plate in the omakase. The food is so good, I would certainly put it in the \"orgasmic food\" category. It is certainly extraordinary.I have been able to get in without much difficulty so far, and I know this won't be the case for long. So I'm trying to enjoy this place as often as I can. We try to stop by every time we visit the Miami area, as we currently live in Ft.Myers.",
      "You know I'm disappointed, my wife had hyped this place up because of the social media attention it's gotten so we decided to give it a try. We had reservations and arrived a bit early but were still seated since there were empty stools. We were seated by the hostess at the far end next to the kitchen doors. Good spot no complaints, we were looking at our menus when one of the young men behind the counter in what appears to be the prep station mentions something to the hostess, we then are told to move to the far end corner in the middle between two couples. This rubbed me the wrong way, after being seated and given the opportunity to look at our menus, you're going to ask us to move without explanation or justification or even an apology? Nevertheless, we moved and looked at our options. Everything is bite-size, I'd say no more than two-three bites unless you order traditional rolls, 8 pieces which I believe are obtainable via QR code on your phone.Let me say, the food is expensive, really expensive. I understand, the boutique nature of the restaurant and the experience but I found the price high in stature compared to the portions of the food. We had two flights, which are 5 pieces of specialty crispy rice. Truffle Avocado, Uni/Ikura, Salmon and Tuna. This was quite delicious, the tuna and salmon were exceptional, tuna and salmon mixed with crispy rice I mean c'mon. The truffle avocado was a delightful surprise. The Uni is unique, I haven't had it before so I didn't know what to expect. The texture was a bit weird for me, but it didn't taste bad. You can say I didn't know what to expect or how it would taste. The scallop was very surprising, great texture and marinated I believe in citrus at least it had that taste. We also went went with the A5, which is wagyu on top of crispy rice. At $18 for a bite size piece, I was a bit shocked but the experience right? It was quite tasty and what I expected but I wasn't floored by it.The sushi rolls were really good, the mix between mango, avocado and cream cheese mix well with the shrimp tempura. Finally, we had a salmon and tuna roll. Quite fresh, light and refreshing. Probably the easiest thing on the menu and what I think works best and an excellent starter. A man who I think was the owner, came by a couple of times and was very nice and attentive. The rest of the staff was a bit cold and there was something off between the hostess and one of the guys in the back, the tension was evident as if one was annoyed at the other. It spilled into our service because we had to place our order with one of the guys in the back and he seemed a bit peeved by it as he looked around for the hostess. I saw several patrons asking for water, and the staff looked surprised as if this were a special request. The service wasn't up to par with the $200 check we received. I do think, Miss Crispy Rice is overpriced, also maybe if you remove the 18% automatic gratuity the employees might want to earn their tip and provide better service. The food was good, I can't give any negative feedback on taste or presentation, the food was delightful and sexy all fun size but with a super size tag.",
      "A hidden gem tucked off to the side of sometimes-crazy Oasis in Wynwood.  Miss Crispy Rice is certainly a unique treat.The $78 13 course omakase is a steal.  It has a great variety of dishes from their menu - a greatest hits, of sorts.  Their pacing late on this weeknight was quick, but that was fine with me as I was just treating myself after a long 12-hour day at work.  Like a tasting menu at a fine restaurant, you alway start off by asking, \"Is this really going to be enough food?\", but you quickly find out that it all adds up fast and you're more than satisfied at the end.The crispy rice instead of the traditional \"soft\" rice used in regular nigiri is great.  I don't think you can eat 12 pieces of it, but Ms. Crispy does a great job a varying up the types of sushi and they textures that you're served.  4 nice pieces of two preparation of sashimi to start, 4 crispy rice nigiris to follow, 4 generously portioned hand roles with regular sushi rice to complete the sushi course.  Wash it all down with a delicious corn and prawn miso soup, followed by tasty sorbet, and you're done.  Superb.I also appreciate the wide variety of unique sake, beers and wines that they have on offer.  Lots of tiny samples so that you can try a lot of things.  A tiny can of sake was perfect. A good handful of 375ml bottles of wine lets you vary things up, or is good enough for a solo diner.Bonus:  They own the churro restaurant next door and treated me to an amazing churro sundae.",
      "I was really excited to try Miss Crispy Rice but I have to say I was disappointed. Is the food good? Yes. However did it blow me away? No. This is a good sushi place but nothing out of the ordinary. It's a very intimate vibe. You sit at a high top bar facing the kitchen. There are about 11 seats in this restaurant. I came on a Wednesday at 8 PM and there was only one other person dining. You get to see the chef preparing everything. I ordered the Crispy Rice Flight to try a bit of everything and I was underwhelmed. The rice itself is perfection. So crunchy and tasty but flavor wise the roll itself lacks. The one that I did really enjoy was the A5. I probably won't be coming back here.",
      "Delicious and intimate sushi bar inside the Oasis in Wynwood. Loved the vegetarian options, esp anything with truffle, and my friends also loved the seafood and izakaya. Everything is prepared to order in front of you, so you get to see the chefs in action. We loved that the dessert was in the same area (Papi churro)",
      "Everything about this meal was spectacular! Service:The owner was able to fit 2 of us in and we were so grateful because we had been wanting to come here for a very long time. Every server was helpful and professional, great service! Food:*Dynamite Oysters - wowwwwww. These are my new favorite cooked oysters. They were creamy, cheesy, zesty, spicy, delicious!!! *Scallop & Uni Izakaya - I can't even describe how great this tasted. The cilantro, the yuzu, the pineapple... it all came together perfectly! *Crispy Rice Flight - my favorites were the avocado, the scallop, and the uni. I plan to do the omakase the next time I come.",
      "So I finally tried them, and I must say they did not disappoint. Previously, I had secretly lurked on IG and stalked them, wondering if the food tasted as good as it looked. I am happy to say that it so did. It actually was even better!!!Let's start with the staff, including Andrew (owner). They were all super friendly and made us feel like we were part of the family. I loved how the layout of the seating around the chef lends itself to a feeling of community with the other diners. The food was awesome, we loved the Scallop Sashimi and the baked oysters. These were probably my 2 favorite bites of the night. I also loved the truffle honey salmon sashimi. Alright 3 best bites of the night. The crispy rices taste as good as they look, and in some cases even more so. Probably my favorite one was the scallop and uni. All in all the food was amazing and I can't wait to try the Omakase menu.",
      "I LOVE IT HERE!!! the experience of being at the bar is awesome. Service is really good, you can talk to the staff  and all of them are friendly. The owner was there too and we felt very welcomed. The food is amazing, I really love the concept of trying different dishes. They also hace an omakaze experience with many courses. The ambience is 7/10. The place is not that pretty, but being at the bar makes up for it because it's a concept we don't see everywhereOverall I really recommend it. And will definitely come again!",
      "Nice place for a quick bite. The offer a fixed priced 15-course omakase which looks tempting.Lots of nice ideas mounted on top bite-sized crispy rice."

      "The food genre in this restaurant is exactly how it is described: vegan and Asian fusion. And for that, the chefs at this small establishment do a fine job at the flavor and creativity they can inject into their dishes. The names of a few items or the ingredients used or even the food presentation and restaurant decor can remind one of the Chinese dim sums, but make no mistake, it is not anywhere like the dim sums in HK and NYC and you will not find that kind of taste here even if they were vegan. But oh man, was I surprised by how delicious they can make vegan food taste?!  We ordered the Classic Bao Buns, Sesame Seitan Wings, Ube Sweet Potato Bao, Pineapple Fried Rice, General Tso's Brussels, and a few others. While we all had our favorite, I really enjoyed each and every one of their creation.Food came at slightly staggered timing so after the first, the second was hot and ready, and there was never any long wait between each serving.  The service was also very good.And, just like the traditional dim sums, it is meant that you order multiple dishes and they be shared.  Or, if you don't come in a group, you can indulge in it all by yourself.It is going to get a little pricey especially for the shockingly small portions (for the price) but for vegan food, the taste in this restaurant definitely stands out.We came here on New Year's day evening without a reservation but luckily the wait was minimal. The restaurant is not that big so beware.There is parking available behind the restaurant but it will test your maneuvering skills.  Don't be hesitant to do the 5- or 7-point turns.  Also, before you park, think first how you are going to get out.",
      "VEGAN DIM SUM!!!Need I say more?The fabulous thing is that this Asian fusion dim sum preserves the appeal of my favorite things about dim sum (small portions + variety, steamers, fluffy baos and sticky rices) while adding a fun modern vegan twist!Examples are the sticky rice (lomaigai) made with bbq jackfruit (although I wish there was a tad more ingredients to contrast the flavor of the bbq because traditional lo mai gai has other ingredients like mushrooms and egg yolk to add a contrasting flavor and texture to the chicken or pork).The matcha brûlée was very creamy and satisfying.The Yu choy with lemon miso was a bit stalky and nothing too special.Broccoli cheddar wontons were fun and executed well. There were quite a few gluten free dishes and an exciting buckwheat scallion pancake. It had the salt, but I do wish this had a bit more of the scallion oil (typically aside from making the pancake with layers of oil and sprinkling scallions, the oil is also cooked with scallion to make a flavorful scallion oil which carries through a strong potent fragrant flavor). It would be nice to see the steamed rice dumplings (gao) though because the main appeal for dim sum is the steamers with the rice/tapioca dumplings filled with shrimp, chives, water chestnuts etc. So subtracting the shrimp there's still many other veggies and mushrooms that can be tapped into creating delicious traditional dim sum. But being this is Pan Asian style, it's okay that it isn't traditional. But there's definitely room to take inspiration from the traditional ones to add more depth to the dishes. The only other thing is everything came with pretty much the same sauces.Otherwise the execution was delightful. I had a lot of fun with this tasting. The service was also very attentive and accommodating. I really want to give 5 stars for being such an amazing business, but I think there's just a bit of room for adding more depth to the texture and flavors of each dish to make it really a special and complete package. You don't have to be authentic or traditional to do dim sum. But you do need to have all the flavors and textures.",
      "Cool lunch spot if it's not too busy , I got a Thai tea for takeout and then took ages to make my drink (for some reason the hostess was making it)Second time I visited I came in for a lunch with a friend , our server recommended us the lunch special , we got 1 appetizer each and 1 main dish + Thai tea This time we got : Avocado Spring Roll : it was yummy Bao Buns : they were good but the Planta ones are way better for what's inside Pineapple fried rice : it was ok Chow Fun : I liked the noodles but it barely had veggies with it Overall I think the portions should be a little bit more generous for the price they are asking and keep in my mind they take their time so don't recommended coming here in a rush",
      "Dear Paula,Thank you for your review. We take pride in our service and are happy to hear you had a positive experience. We would love to see you again and will make sure you have a wonderful meal next time!Sincerely,The Minty Z team",
      "Service - A+Food - AAmbience - AOverall, an amazing meal!We came for a 5:30pm seating and were surprised to see all the tables filled - definitely get a reservation if you can!We debated whether to do a la carte or splurge on the 8-course forest omakase, and ended up going with the omakase. I would recommend this option if you want to be surprised with every dish and are pretty hungry (as it ends up being a lot of food)! It may seem like the portions are small for the first 2 courses, but trust me that it gets quite filling after that. Some of the highlights for me were the kobucha squash soup, the sweet and sour mushrooms, and the dim sum (shrimp shumai and \"beef\" gyoza, which together counted as one course). The entire meal took about 2 hours. The service was exceptionally good - our waiter must have come back like 10 times over the course of the meal to refill our tea. Each course was presented beautifully and the waiter helped answer our questions about each dish. One of the highlights of our time in Miami!",
      "Overall: Great food, service, and ambience! I highly recommend. Finding the place/parking:It was a little hard finding the place for me; a little more challenging finding parking. They do have a lot on the right side of the building to park, but it's only a few spaces. It is free so if you find a space I recommend taking it only if:1) you can park in reverse 2) have a small car like a sedanAmbience: I almost missed it walking because it has a small front entrance, but luckily they had ppl outside working so I was able to ask. I love the aesthetic inside the restaurant. It's small but true to its earthy vegan roots.Food: My friend and I were going to split a few things. The server recommended the Omakase and I will say it was the way to go! I wish I wrote down the names of all the food. We honestly thought we weren't going to get full but it was a lot of food so don't be deceived. Service: Great! The server made sure to ask if we had any food allergies, which my friend did and the chef accommodated her allergies with the omakase. Can't wait to come here again!",

      "Was nearby in the morning doing some jetski and then was wandering around town looking for a place.  I'll caveat what I'm about to say that I'm from the NJ/NY area and we have plenty of vegan places so this is not something new to me.  So, I found their portion to price rather disappointing.  I don't mind paying higher prices but it really seemed disproportionate.  Unfortunately i don't have a picture of the brussel sprouts but the literally only covered half of the serving plate.  Perhaps this is a mechanism that they were using to get people to order more dishes as they were really pressing folks to do the $50 per person set menu.  Now, for the tastes.  The curry noodles was tasty but under seasoned which made the dish a bit on the bland side.  The pineapple fried rice didn't seem to have much pineapple.  I love brown rice but that really all i tasted.  As mentioned above, had the brussel sprouts and those were probably the one dish i actually enjoyed, although it was made pretty simply.  Sorry, I just wasn't a fan.Edit: added additional photo - daughter had a photo of the Brussels. See, literally, looked like something was missing from the plate",

      "I came here on a Sunday afternoon. I had made a reservation for the tasting menu for 3:15. I had noticed that they closed from 4 to 5 but on the website I was able to make reservations until 4 so I figured it was fine. There is a small parking lot to the right of the establishment (if you are looking at it straight on) where you can park for free while you enjoy your meal.I sat down and waited for my friend to join me. When our waitress came over we advised her that we wanted to do the tasting menu as we made a specific reservation for it. She then advised us that since they were closing at 4 that we could do the tasting menu but that everything would come out at the same time. We were okay with that since each of us had driven about 40 mins and we were excited about the meal.  We ordered a pitcher of sangria and waited patiently for our food. The first thing that came out was the cauliflower kimchee. It was a good starter, I loved the spice. Then the second course was the avocado eggroll. I liked the aromatics that were in the avocado and it paired well with the sauce. Then we got the tower of dim sum. We had the bao buns, the shrimp shumai, and the dumplings. The bao buns was by far my favorite thing that I tried. It was so delicious! Then the shrimp shumai and the dumplings were a tie for a close second. Then came the Massaman curry noodles. These were also really flavorful and delicious. However, when I grabbed my bowl I noticed that it was dirty on the outside and it grossed me out. The flavor of the sauce was really delicious and it had fresh herbs inside and jalapenos which made it really aromatic and a little spicy. Okay as our noodles were coming out it was around 3:55 and another group of people walked in and they were able to get sat at a table. I was pretty annoyed about that because the whole reason that they rushed us throughout the whole tasting process was because the kitchen was closing. So if the kitchen was closing why would they sit another table 5 mins before closing. Also I realized that there was a man hosting job interviews as this whole thing was going on so I found the service really rushed and unprofessional. We were not even done with our noodles when they brought out the dessert. We had taken almost two bites of it and we had the man who just finished doing the job interviews bring us a box and asked if we were ready for the check. Overall the food was good but the service was really sub par.",

      "Arrived to Minty Z, which was a bit smaller than I expected with reservations. They have a small indoor and outdoor space. It was about half full and we were sat in the 'backish' by the open kitchen. A group behind us didn't have reservations and got the prime window seating. I didn't understand how they decided that, and I wish I had requested the window from the start. OK not a deal breaker by any sorts, but a minor grievance to start. Our sever was very kind, friendly and attentive to our experience. We went with the $45 per person, six course omakase. It's a great introduction to the vegan Asian food inspired experience. The starting cauliflower kimchi definitely had a spicy kick, not for those with a sensitive palette. The veggie spring rolls were very much as expected, maybe even on the blander side. The next four dishes got better. The faux shrimp and meat dumplings were well crafted. I loved the mushroom bao buns - great texture and flavor. The pineapple fried rice was good. While donut type things aren't normally my go to, the Thai style donuts with a sesame caramel finish had a beautifully doughy interior, crispy shell and uniquer dipping sauce. This is a great place to try if you're vegan. I'd say the dim sum is definitely worth trying and the dessert if sweets are your thing! Definitely try those crispy mushroom bao buns!",
      "Dear Rajiv,Thank you for dining in with us, and we appreciate your review. I'm sorry your experience wasn't exceptional. Please never hesitate to let us know in the moment and we will do our absolute best to remedy any grievance. We care about the customer experience and are grateful for your business.

      "Not a vegan myself but definitely enjoy seeing the creative spins these restaurants do on meat-containing dishes.Their Pineapple Fried Rice, BBQ Jackfruit Bao Buns are so good! All their seasonings and sauces used are delicious.",
      "Antonio was our server for the 8 course omakase dinner service. He was divine. I'm not vegan but the food was incredible.Too much food. Great value. Consider a la Carte. But i will 100% be back! In fact, ordering tonight for take out as I NEED the corn wontons."

      "What an amazing spot, we absolutely LOVED it. It's fairly young and trendy, so I would not take my baby boomer parents here (or a baby in general)- but for a younger, fun, lively crowd, this is perfect. The inside is really cool - lots of artwork, somewhat hidden restaurant, similar to a speakeasy. The drinks were unique and incredible and the food was OUTSTANDING! Very gastronomic - if you're into that sort of thing (my parents wouldn't get it). We basically ordered the entire menu, until we nearly exploded. Here were a few memorable plates (as in, those I can remember after imbibing for a few hours)...Spanglish milk bread - the black salt on top. WOW. They say, once you go black (salt), you never go back right? Exactly. The guava butter was unlike any butter I have ever had. It's very tropical, and fruity! Wagyu beef ravioli - that blue cheese sauce was to die for - take some of that milk bread and drunk your bread in this sauce to your heart's desire (and worry about the consequences later, because bread and cheese, whew!) Nitro Watermelon Tataki - the only remotely healthy thing that entered our mouths at dinner. It's such a cool fish - watermelon, pomegranate seeds, toasted pumpkin seeds, olive oil and a total flavor overload. Not to mention the fact that the fish came out looking like sashimi grade tuna. So cool. Arroz Mamposteado - this was a cool fish. It was rice and beans, but mixed with avocado creme and and pork belly and chips. Incredible. I'm not much of a dessert but holy smokes did we devour the suspiro. I'm quite positive I licked the jar towards the end of the evening - don't judge me. I wish I could remember what cocktail I had, but the choices are all so unique and fun, I should have tried them all. Eh, gives me a reason to go back, right?!",
      "Thank you so much for the kind words and the detailed review of all of our dishes, Shannon.  It was a pleasure hosting you, and we look forward to your next visit!",
      "Obsessed is an understatement.Found this place on Yelp (I love you Yelp!) and with the rating and images I knew I was SOLD. The show stopping, craft cocktails is what I came for and I wasn't sure what to expect once we came. Was it a hype? Would I be disappointed? Who cares! You're in Miami and going to a Spanglish cocktail bar. We didn't make reservations but we did read it wasn't too hard to get in. And it was exactly just that. Came here at around 9:30 pm on a Saturday night and we were seated to the side entrance table with couches right away. It wasn't a good option for dining but we literally only came here for the cocktails so it was perfect!The vibe check in this place was everything. There was a live dj tucked in to the side making sure the music was on point. And it was!On to the craft cocktails:I ordered the Pornstar Mejican@ and it was delicious wish the mezcal was more of the star of the show and to be honest, given that everyone else's cocktails were truthfully visually so pleasing wish the presentation for this one was as well but that's totally ok!!! I still loved my experience. My hubby ordered the Cafetera Old Fashioned and WOW. What a presentation and fun way to serve it with an actual cafetera. It was definitely a show stopper. The Caipirinha Frizá was delicious and very unique as well and the Paparazzi came served in a photo lens so that was pretty cool!We loved Spanglish, would be back in a heart beat. Overall great vibes for cocktails and pretty cool presentation that really makes this place stand out. Excited to try their food next time!",
      "This place gives my New York Vibes OD! It's definitely giving New York Speakeasy Vibes. You'll probably miss it if your not paying attention because the sign outside is only a neon bottle sign. Inside is intimate with the cutest decor, low key, playing all the classic jams. I love a place that sets a vibe with an good playlist! Okayyy! We came for drinks after dinner, so we didn't order food but they did have a menu. All the drinks we ordered were sooo freakin good, and were in creative instagram worthy cups. This is definitely going to be my new hideaway spot. Service was amazing! Will be coming back!",
      "Okay, here's the thing with this place, it's so freaking loud that you can barely hear the person next to you, it's impossible to have any sort of conversation with a large group of people. The food was okay and drinks were pretty good on the other hand, so I think this is a good place for dates, just not a large gathering.",
      "Hi Anton, thank you so much for taking the time to share your experience at Spanglish.  We apologize for the music being too loud, and this is something we’re going to adjust.  Although, we’re happy to hear you enjoyed the drinks!We hope to see you again soon!",

      "The entrance to Spanglish is so subtle that it's easy to miss! Once you enter, the ambiance is cozy, intimate, and welcoming. We came because of the happy hour -- their cocktails were $9 and some small dishes were marked down! We ordered a round of the caipirinhas first and sadly were a bit disappointed, it was way more tart than expected and just tasted like lemon juice. The Chilcano tasted similar with the overpowering citrus. The Spanglish mule was way better! For small plates, we ordered the octopus croquettes, Caribbean dumplings, and a side of yuca. The octopus croquettes were my favorite of the items we ordered -- crispy, served hot, and the octopus inside was tender. The Caribbean dumplings were a little mushy, and the yuca was a bit tough and the sauce it was served with tasted like Big Mac sauce which I am not a fan of. Everything came out pretty fast, though!",
      "Finally got to visit Spanglish and let's just say I fell in love! I came here for happy hour with a friend and honestly we were blown away by how delicious everything was. We ordered the Spanish Milk Bread, Timba Frita, Queso E' Craba , and Tuna Tostadas. My favorite dish we tried was the Timbra Frita. It was the perfect bite full of flavor. We also ordered cocktails. We both ordered the Paparazzi which honestly tasted amazing but the presentation was killer. It comes served in a camera lens. Overall this place is a vibe. The music was lit. They were playing bad bunny. The artwork is awesome. I definitely see myself coming back here.",
      "Location a bit hidden in plain sight, so be sure to stop and read signs. Small  and intimate setting with a great ambiance for drinks and light bites with friends. The food was ok nothing over the top or extraordinary. I did like my margarita with the seafood bites. Drinks here before a walk around in Wynwood is never a bad idea.",
      "This place has no sign in front. We drive up and down and finally found it. Outside looks like it was closed. Nothing indicating it was opened except for a sign out front that shows menu of the day. We walked it and surprisingly was like wow. This is a cute small cozy restaurant.  The booth I say were pretty close to one another.  The bar area has 6 stools. The food was excellent! Extremely flavorful and so good. The octopus appetizer was amazing. We ordered one of their popular dish and weren't disappointed.  I forgot to photo that dish because I was so hungry.  Everything we had was great including the drinks. We love craft drinks and for sure it was super crafty. The paparazzi drink was so cute. It came in a camera cup and tasted great.I would be definitely coming back here again soon and recommend everyone to try if you haven't been here.",
      "Came here to try a few drinks on a Friday night and it wasn't as busy as I expected. I was able to sit at the bar and watch the bartender make these really cool looking and tasty drinks! The paparazzi was my favorite. Something about the dill and passion fruit combination was something I didn't know I needed. The vuela paloma was just okay, I'm just not the biggest fan of grapefruit. And the cafetera old fashioned tasted like a REALLY strong Cuban coffee, which I really enjoyed. Although the drinks were great, the vibe was kinda ruined by these drunk idiots sitting next to us at the bar, yelling and screaming. But I would still come here again to enjoy a cool curated cocktail."

Incredible. - Tiramisu OMG - get it. - Tableside Caesar - Very nice server - Ben - Foccacia bread The good: - Meatball App - The wine cellar and steak presentation as you walk in is a nice touch General feedback: - Dimming the lights a bit more would give it some real ambiance and a homier feel  - They JUST opened so cut the staff some slack. I've been on a team opening a restaurant before and it's so hard. They did great! - Good location - easy access with ample parking. A local steakhouse is just what the neighborhood needs - The staff was really sweet and everyone was really working hard all night.",
      "Went here for a birthday dinner. They have a great menu with all sorts of selections.  Our waiter was pushy and rude.  We ordered a NY Strip, Branzino, Pasta Bolonaize, Filet Minan, truffle fries and salad.  The steaks were ordered medium well done.  All the food was good except the steaks.  They kept bringing back the steaks rare and the waiter was angry with nasty comments toward us.  If you go here avoid this guy.  We told the mgr who seemed surprised.",

      "Hello my name is Nick. Of course I'm from New York. I usually don't write reviews specially bad ones we got to this nice restaurant very gorgeous inside. The bread was delicious. I have to say the first course was a pasta dish we split. It had a Bolognese sauce on it it was served hot and good. Little did I know that was the highlight of a dinner. My steak came out first they cut it up which I wasn't crazy about but it was cold. my friends ordered a veal dish a special order. They accommodated them but the dish also was ice cold. The dish presentation was very nice but it being cold was definitely a problem. I must mention the sides to twice cook baked potato was a baked potato not twice cooked. The cream spinach was nice fresh baby spinach sautéed with melted cheese on top. The menu, said cream of spinach. I do wish they would get their act together, and I would even consider trying it again. The Decour is very elegant. It was Christmas Eve. We got there at 6:15 and it wasn't that busy. There was no excuse for the cold food. I must say I was very disappointed. My name is nick hogan.",
      "Nice bar.  Quality food.   Good service    Except bartender Angie.  Good wine and liquor selection",

      "Seaspice was amazing. It's a fantastic restaurant with a great view right on the Miami River. If you don't right you can catch the live music as the sun sets, and the restaurant transforms to a lounge. Totally worth coming Parking is tricky, and if you're not paying attention you might miss it as you drive by. But it's a gem worth coming back to.",
      "Seaspice is known to Miami locals as a very high end resturant, frequented by celebrities.  I have no idea why.  The service is pretty awful.  The drink runners are horrible.  It takes about 30 minutes for just a drink to be brought out to you.  The food is mediocre.  It is definitely NOT worth the price, which is very expensive.  I am giving two stars because the view is amazing.  Seaspice is right on the water and has a gorgeous ambiance.  You can watch yachts drive by and some will even pull up and park.  The other star is for the tres leches.  This dessert was AMAZING, I would go back just to eat it again.  But otherwise, Seaspice is nothing special.  Save your money.",
      "A place that tries to be high end but fails to deliver.Service ? Mediocre Food ? Below parFirst thing when you check in is they tell you that you have a 2 hr max(tacky)",
      "I read this was one of the best patio dining AND a hot spot for celebrities in Miami, so I had to go check it out on our recent travels to this area...Initially I was worried about our luggage situation, as we had to carry our luggage to the restaurant since this was our last stop in Miami. However, they were very accommodating, and let us store some of our stuff in the closet, and we kept the big luggage with us, near our table.As expected, the patio scene was spectacular...city skyline and seaside views, with plenty of yachts passing by! The place indeed had that chic celebrity vibe...truly FAB! Loved the music overhead as well. Somehow, I expected some snobbiness...but not at all. Service was great!Then the food. OMFG...I've had some amazing foods lately, but this takes the cake. Even the complimentary bread was amazing (and unique)! My husband ordered this Wagyu Burger, and I chose this Ragu Pappardelle ( THE best Ragu Pappardelle I've ever had...EVER. ). Then this Pavola dessert...again, just beyond delish. Truly, this was foods for the celebrities.Honestly, I'm shocked at how low the rating is for this place. I assume that if the service isn't top notch, it would probably piss some folks off. The pricing was on the outlandish side...with even lunch entrees starting at around 40. There was even an appetizer item priced at around 70 bucks! Luckily, like I said, I felt that the foods and the service (and especially the spectacular ambiance) made up for it. There was this big yacht parked right near us, which somewhat blocked some of the views from the left. Still, we got our eyeful of seaside/yachtside views.In any case, this was a great way to end our trip in Miami.",
      "Went here with a group of girlfriends for brunch and everything was delicious, they were super accommodating as well.I had the froze , a cucumber and gin cocktail and 2 grey goose and sodas and all were fantastic.As a table we split the fresh fish and a couple sides and it was delicious. Also love the free bread It is definitely on the pricier side overall tbh but great for a fun \"fancy\" brunch",
      "Came here for Miami spice and although we spent more than we thought we would, we had a good time. Everything was delicious. The kale Caesar had pecans and Granny Smith apple slices, never had a Caesar like this but it was a nice change! The Shrimp Pesto Whole Wheat Spaghetti was my favorite, even though I'm not the biggest fan of pesto. The burger was good too just a little messy from the truffle aioli. The chocolate cremoso and tres leches was very good but I'd go with the cremoso for the cocoa nib crumble, yum! All in all, I think it's overpriced and I probably won't come here again because of that. The cheapest bottle of Chardonnay was $75 and most drinks were $20. I only came here for Miami spice and still spent almost $200.",
      "Given we still have Miami Spice going on until the end of the month we decided to try out the lunch menu @ Seaspice gorgeous location on the Miami River, sitting outdoor is really relaxing, so beautiful to watch the boats go by, really lovely To start we had the Comte' Cheese Soufflé, I have to admit this was a bit disappointing, it really did not have the texture of a real soufflé  but then............ the Shrimp Pesto Whole Wheat Spaghetti and the Pan-Seared Chilean Seabass were really good as dessert, both the Tres Leches and the Chocolate Cremoso were yummy Try it out before Miami Spice ends, you can check out the Miami Spice Menus on miamiandthebeaches.com@seaspicemia",
      "First time for me at Seaspice, it is located on the banks of the Miami River it is a gem that you should not miss. Sit outside in the courtyard enjoy your food and a drinks while watching the boats go by, just beautiful We had the Miami Spice lunch which has a very affordable fix price 3 course menu for $ 28, unfortunately this will end soon, nevertheless, I would defiantly go back again for sureRegarding the Miami Spice menu only one observation, they should have had more than one choice for the Entrees without the extra charge, right now you have 4 choices and 3 of these have extra charge on it, not really fair given that you are promoting the Spice menu, you should have at least two or three choices included in the price and one or two with the extra charge We had had Prince Edward Island Mussels, Grilled, the Grilled Faroe Island Salmon and the Profiteroles and Peaches and Cream. My favorite where the Mussels, the garlic pizza bread they brought for the table was absolutely delicious, the Salmon was good too. I had the Peaches for dessert and it was ok, not really my thing, my friend said the Profiteroles were great, next time I will not opt for the healthy dessert We enjoyed all with a good Albariño wine, our experience was made especially enjoyable by our waiter Fabrizio, he was really great ! Thank you Fabrizio @seaspicemia",
      "Bad first impression. Its not a nice feeling to feel like you have to beg to spend your money at a restaurant. Every year I look forward to Miami Spice. It's a great way to try out various restaurants and a unique spread of menu options. Seaspice was on my radar and happened to be one of the participating restaurants offering the Miami Spice menu. I contacted the restaurant in advance and made a reservation for 3:30p for a party of four. My mom who is from out of town was excited to join us for lunch. I advised the restaurant we were doing the Miami Spice menu. The restaurant made it clear that they charge $50pp for No Shows. At 3:15pm, we arrived for our reservation. The hostess Karin greeted us, and advised us that they were running behind on the reservations and because of this they will not be able to offer the Miami Spice menu. Only the a la-carte menu will be offered. This was a bit upsetting because we drove almost an hour to get there and the restaurant is refusing to offer the Miami Spice promotion. Our natural instinct was to just say forget it we will go somewhere else. I mean, at the end of the day who wants to beg to spend their money? It's absurd. If the restaurant is offering a promotional menu and because to no fault of our own they are running behind why should we be penalized?My Mom looked so bummed out. Because she was so excited to try this place. I decided to walk back in and ask for a Manager. The Manager took 20min to come out. When he finally did come over, he introduced himself as Collin. I explained to him what was going on and it seemed as though he wasn't aware that the hostesses were turning Miami Spice customers away. He decided to make it right and advised Karin to honor the Miami Spice menu. Impressive! Things were turning around. Besides the encounter at the hostess stand, the restaurant is beautiful. It is situated on Miami's waterfront were you can view the million dollar yachts passing by. They also have docks for those interested in docking and dining. You can view the downtown city skyline which I am sure looks amazing at night.The food was excellent. The Miami Spice menu offered a three course lunch for $28. You have the choice of a starter (Kale Salad, Cheese Souffle, or White Gazpacho). A choice of entrees (Seabass, Chicken Breast, Shrimp Pesto Pasta, Wagyu Burger, or Plant Bowl). And a choice of dessert (Tres Leches or Chocolate Cremoso). They also offer the option to add a Glass of wine for and additional $12. I ordered the Comte Cheese Souffle, the Green Circle Farms Chicken Breast, and the Tres Leches. The others in my party ordered the Kale Salad, Gazpacho, and Seabass. For starters, My favorites were the Kale Caesar Salad and Cheese Souffle. The Kale Caesar had a mix of shredded Granny Smith apples, pecans and a creamy Caesar dressing. The cheese Souffle was like a fluffy egg Souffle with a cream parmesan sauce and tomato chutney. Delicious!For entrees, both the Seabass and Chicken breast were amazing. The Chicken breast was tender and juicy, served on top of a creamy polenta and topped with corn, peas, and mushrooms. The seabass was seared nicely to give a nice crunch on the outside, while perfectly flaky and moist on the inside. It was served with stewed garbanzo, Swiss chard, and smoked potato. For desserts, we all had Tres Leches. It was served in a small Mason jar topped with 3 milks, and berries. Perfect way to end the meal. The portions are not large but it is filling. The flavors are fresh and very well balanced. The food presentation was notable. The Watermelon Tequila drink was delightful and refreshing. The froze was also a big hit. The cocktails were presented well and created perfectly. We enjoyed everything. Our waiter, Austin was very friendly. He made great recommendations and was very attentive.An 18% gratuity was added to the tab. There are lots of street parking accessible. In the end, the food was great. Ambience was amazing. The hostesses can use additional customer service training and learn to use better judgment to improve the customers experience. There was no need to escalate the matters to a manager. It could have been handled properly by showing empathy, apologizing, and finding a solution to the problem.",
      "Hi Kim,Thank you for dining with us and leaving a detailed review. It has been forwarded to our management team. Our apologies for the confusion at the door.  Glad to hear Collin accommodated you and your experience was turned around.  We are happy to see your great feedback regarding the food, cocktails, and Austin’s Service.  Hopefully you will join us again in the near future!",
      "This is my second time going to sea spice & I normally love it as the first time. I never leave bad reviews But this second time MY PHONE WAS STOLEN AND SECURITIES DID NOThing about it. Instead we're trying to blame me for the situation. I'm not drunk nor was drunk. I walked in with 2 phone and walked out with 1.We came as my friend USUALLY does and this is how they treated us  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME. I thought it was 5 star so nothing could go wrong. With a security right next to our table my phone STILLL got stolen. It was on the table. And to whoever has the time to steal phones is just sad imagine what else they can steal... I wil ask to review cameras but with the way I was treated when I let them know I lost my phone I doubt they will be helpful but I'll let every platform form of review know that they steal phones here. I know the exact time frame as well so they wouldn't even have to look much at the cameras. Let's see. BTW I BEEN HOME SICK AFTER EATING THESE OYSTERS I COULDNT Even celebrate my baby's birthday w him.",
      "Came here for my birthday dinner with my boyfriend for a 7:15 reservation (we called in advance for an outdoor seat dock side) we waited about ten minutes after our arrival for our table to be ready at the bar, the short wait was definitely worth it. Started with an aperol spritz at the bar then ordered octopus and gazpacho to start. Octopus portion was good but the olive oil tasted burnt since it came out on a sizzling hot cast iron looking skillet (its very easy to overcook octopus, please just bring a regular plate next time.) I also had the whole main lobster. Extremely delicious large portion of perfectly cooked and seasoned lobster, bravo. My boyfriend had the truffle coated Chilean sea bass and he absolutely loved it. Vibe: 5/5 this place definitely is a scene but not overwhelmingly pretentious or obnoxious. Absolutely loved the music as well. Service:3/5 A bit slow, our server was very attentive when we were able to get his attention but we had to always wave him down. Food: 4/5 everything was honestly pretty good (octopus could've had a bit more attention to detail)",
      "Hi Liz,Thank you for celebrating your birthday with us!  We are so happy to hear you had a great experience and enjoyed the food.  Your feedback regarding the octopus has been sent to our chef. We look forward to seeing you again soon!"

      "Hands down my favorite restaurant in Miami. Ambiance is upbeat and intimate. Food is AMAZING does not miss in the year I've been going consistently. Service is outstanding .",
      "Amazing steakhouse Our favorite was the the Australian Wagyu which I can only say was perfection. their sides were so perfectly complimentary. Truffle Mac and cheese, the Brussels sprouts, spinach, broccolini and cauliflower were excellent. Beef lettuce wraps were decent, beet salad was good, kids meals were devoured. ALSO if you're here for breakfast their buffet is great",
      "WOW - To say I was completely blown away by my first time dining here would be an understatement. Whether you're celebrating a special occasion or just craving a delectable meal that will leave you speechless, this is the spot that will be sure to leave a lasting impression. From the lavish and trendy decor, the out of this world dishes, beautiful presentations and impeccable service, every detail was taken well into consideration and perfected.I can say with certainty that this is one of the most gorgeous spaces I've ever eaten a meal in. The sultry vibe, elegantly designed interior, endless display of wine bottles scattered throughout the restaurant and the stunning bar will have you feeling like you're in the midst of dining amongst celebrities. There didn't seem to be a bad table to dine at in sight, but my parents and I were lucky enough to snag one of the beautiful half-moon booths toward the center of the room. When is the last time you've been to a restaurant that brings complimentary French fries to the table? And not just any regular ole' French fries, but a delicious trio of French fries each complimented by their own unique dipping sauce? Bet it's probably never happened before, unless you've eaten here. I thought this was such a neat but simple touch that really set them apart from other high-end restaurants. They also bring yummy rolls topped with sea salt to the table (between the fries & the bread, you might end up in a food coma before you even order if you're not careful). I ordered the tuna tartar for an appetizer and I was in heaven every time I took a bite. Not only does it melt in your mouth, but the presentation alone is enough reason to order this (the way they mix it for you makes for a fun video opportunity if you have your phone ready to record). My parents shared a shrimp cocktail that they both enjoyed - The shrimp were massive! Following the appetizers, I munched on a cesar salad which was perfectly dressed. Now... the STEAK. Holy moly, one of the best filet mignons I have had yet. It was ridiculously flavorful, tender & juicy. Melted in your mouth and bursted with flavor. If you're a steak lover, it would be a crime to come here and not order it. The mashed potatoes that accompanied it were also flavorful, but I thought they were a little too runny (my only complaint of the whole meal). If you're a fan of grilled onions, do yourself a favor and order a side of these to top your steak with and thank me later. The \"Smoked Chocolate S'mores\" dessert was ridiculously decadent and was the perfect finish to an impeccable meal. Yes, it's insanely pricy and yes, it's totally worth it. My experience here was one of the best dining experiences I've ever had in Miami - And that says a lot given the fact that Miami is one of the hottest spots in the country for foodies. This restaurant hit it out the park for me and I'm already searching for an excuse to go back to South Florida and to savor new dishes on their menu.",
      "The restaurant is spacious and nice. Bar is nice as well.Staff was friendly and attentive.For appetizers the tuna tartare was fresh and seasoned well.They also bring you French fries 3 different ways with 3 different sauces. I had the certified Angus rib cap cooked medium rare and It was good and flavorful. The side of Mac and Cheese was good as well.",
      "Our favorite was the the Australian Wagyu which I can only say was perfection.",
      "Ambiance was awesome. The dishes, coctails and the dessert were so delicious. All the employees were so polite and friendly. They celebrated our honeymoon with a cute card, it was so nice.They made our special day unforgettable.",
      "Wonderful experience! Fabulous service. Timing, everything was a 10.  Our server really made our night fabulous, she was awesome. Great steak, Mac and cheese with truffle was really nice. Molten cake was super good as well. I must say everything was impeccable.",
      "Phenomenal cuisine. Never have a enjoyed such a succulent and flavourful sea bass - it is one of their renowned specials. But the lack of bones in the fish was made up for by the pained bones in my rear.The decor was beautiful but very far from comfortable. The low chairs were too uncomfortable for eating. The benches; built for slaves.The overall experience was truly hampered by a god awful designer deserving of life in prison for her domestic terror on comfort. 4/5 not bad",
      "This plus is amazing! We had a private room & our server was Erin. Erin was very pleasant, patient, informative & very professional. She suggested several appetizers & dinner. It was our first time visiting this restaurant & it definitely won't be our last.",
      "Food was incredible. I love that when you get to the table instead of getting some bread you get french fries. Service was also impeccable and ambiance is very family friendly in my opinion"

      "We went there in search of the previous occupant, Hooters. As the menu was similar, and the staff very receptive, we decided to stay and eat. The food was good, not excellent but good. Our server, identified as Joyce K, went out of her way to accommodate in every way possible, showing a professionalism no longer common in waitressing.  A real credit to her job and employers! Our hats off to her.The one drawback, for which we will not be back, was that upon receiving our check, there was a 20% \"service charge\" tacked on, which we had not seen mentioned on the menu. And then before signing, we were presented with a suggestion for a further tip! While we never fail to tip, having worked in food service ourselves, such an affront negated all the positive of our dining experience. It is a shame that eating establishments see the need to bilk their customers in this manner, and for that reason, we have taken to dining out less and less.Otherwise, keep up the good work.",
      "Decent food. The service was a different level of awful. The waiter took forever to come over and greet us. When he finally did he took half of the drink order and the drinks all came out at different times, if this is where it ended than it wouldn't be such a bad experience. When it came time for the food they forgot two entrees so basically we were finished eating before the other two even got their meals. Not a single apology, just kept going on his way. Stay away, far away.",
      "Had a good experience at the bayside one but this one I wasn't too much of a fan. The host was nowhere to be found so we waited around in the front trying to figure out if someone would acknowledge us. We didn't like where we were being sat for the game so the host was nice enough to move us and next thing we have a server in our face demanding to know if we had reservations as if we sat there on our own. Bad start. At the bayside location the lychee Martinis were excellent but it tasted so bad. It not only didn't look like lychee martini but tasted like something completely different. Pointed this out to our server who assured us it was a lychee martini but couldn't tell us what was in it and that just because it wasn't presented the same as bayside didnt mean it wasn't the same. I am aware but I'm also a drinker and I know that drink was wrong. Also, different location or not the food and drinks should be consistent I wasn't letting it go so he offered a remake which I accepted and I never had to do. Next one came with a funky looking lychee which I did not eat. Drink looked different than first but it just tasted like a lemon drop. I wanted a coconut margarita but they didn't have the purée so decided on a passion fruit one and I didn't enjoy it. It wasn't sweet, it didn't taste like a margarita which is bizarre because that's one of the easiest drinks to make. I didn't want our server to feel bad so told him not to worry about it. Sweet Thai chili wings were good. The Mac & cheese was plentiful. Our server was apologetic and kept checking on us which is the only reason gave it an additional star",
      "Decent spot to stop in for bar food, we went on a Sunday night & just ordered appetizers. It was pretty empty but I can imagine this place gets packed during happy hour, NFL & NBA seasons. We ordered the nachos that were good they weren't amazing but nothing special, no complaints though. We also got the fried pickles which were pretty much all batter we couldn't really taste the pickles which was unfortunate. The wings were my favorite thing we ordered, my boyfriend loved the BBQ sauce on his wings. I ordered the medium wings I thought they were great I just didn't think they weren't spicy enough for medium sauce. If you're looking for bar food or a place to watch the game with friends in Downtown give Black Market a try!",
      "At its heart it is a sports bar.  You will find TVs surrounding the bar with different sporting events.  The servers are fun and welcoming so it makes it easy to get the beer flowing.  I had the burger which was properly cooked with the onion rings which are an add on.  I think they are worth it.",
      "The best found I ever had!! We drove 15 hours to Miami from Virginia and enjoyed everything!!! From the hospitality to the drinks and the food!! The staff was awesome!!! The Christmas music was a plus!!!! I loved it!!! Definitely will be back to eat and visit!!!",
      "This spot has a good atmosphere. Our server was good considering he had a bunch of tables. The food and price were decent, the litchi martini was to die for. Fun for sport game days.",
      "Got here 2 hours before closing && was told by the host the kitchen was closed ... We proceeded to sit at the bar for drinks && I asked if it was ok to order food since I saw others ppl food being brought out && she said yes.... The menu didn't have a lot of options for me so we settled for just wings && loaded fries (they were not loaded like in the other pics I see on here)... the chicken was great && seasoned, the fries were ok, didn't eat them... But shouts out to the bartender!!!!! the drinks were AMAZING 10/10!!!!! && her service was great as well...",
      "Located in downtown, our group and I came here to watch a Miami Heat game on a Saturday night. Although we came in time before the game started, to find parking, it was a hassle. Once inside, since we did not have a reservation, we had to wait around 15-20 minutes for a table of 7. But we were able to order drinks at the bar while we waited to be seated. This sports bar/restaurant decor is pretty cool with lots of sports objects and memorabilia. As we were finally at our table, we ordered the house macaroni and cheese, wings, pitchers of beers, margaritas, burgers, nachos, and tequila shots. The food was okay but the drinks were better. However, it was so much fun when the crowd was cheering for the game. Overall, we had a good time watching the game and celebrating.",
      "The food was nice, hot and fresh. The staff was friendly, patient and understanding. The food taste great. The martini was strong. My spouse and i were happy today 6pm. We were out by 6:45pm due to our busy schedule and it was definitely worth it going here."

With gin/sodas in one hand and chop sticks in the other, I tried Poke OG's hybrid bowl and as always was obsessed. The crowd is a little mix of all ages, which is nice to see and everyone in the outside area is truly there to have a good time.

      "This is an Asian  gastronomic center in Winwood. There were about 6 places to choose from food-wise. There is one place for desserts, and one bar. The food was delicious and the communal sitting area was great. The indoor and outdoor sitting area are decorated really nice. It's a great place to meet up with friends to hang out, or eat something and have a rest from exploring the Wynwood art scene... if it weren't for the music. The music was great, but it was being played so loud, we couldn't talk, so we just ate and left. This is why I gave it 3 stars, if it weren't for the music being so loud, I would have given it 5 .The different food joints specialize in different Asian foods: ramen, sushi, poke, dumplings, etc. There's definitely something for everyone. The bar situation was a little disappointing.  Although the bar looks impressive, the menu was less than average with very little cocktail options. All in all, I liked it enough that I would go again, if only to see whether the volume of the music was just a bad coincidence or if it is the norm.",
      "Very rude and unprofessional. We were standing in line outside for 25 minutes ans when we finally got to the front door, the man at the door said they were only letting a particular party in.So if that is the case, why did they have so many unsuspecting people wasting time waiting to get in? Why not go through the line or make an announcement that somebody paid to shut the place down? It was during Art Basel week and so very weird.I do not recommend.",
      "I've been coming for years. 3 things keep me coming back: The Food / Drinks - There are 5 different vendors inside serving up delicious Japanese cuisine. Sushi, rice bowls, ramen, dim-sum, and more. However, I find it super disappointing that it's 2022 almost 2023 and no vendor has anything to offer for individuals that have specific dietary restrictions ex. vegetarians/vegans/gluten-free etc. I do not have any complains personally, but being with a group this weekend, I couldn't please everyone by recommending / offering this place. My favorite drink is the Frozen Passion Fruit that comes in a Japanese take out box :) it's perfect on a hot afternoon also Thai tea is good too! The Music - Always GREAT - in all honesty I've seen some of the best DJ sets here. In addition to it being a place to eat, and after 1am only a place to dance...they sell records throughout the day. The discography isn't huge, but they cater a lot to hip-hop / r&b and extensions of that - you can get lucky with some alternative genres but not much of it. The Ambiance - There's always a vibe!1-800 lucky is a great spot to eat/drink/dance and have an overall good time.",
      "Food: 3 STARSThe food was fair. I went with the famous pork belly buns. I was excited and expecting a great outcome but was slightly disappointed when I went in for the bite. The pork was a slab of fatty meat covered in sauce. I've had way better pork buns elsewhere. The real winner here is the ice cream we went with the classic vanilla Taiyaki cone. It never fails. ALWAYS A HIT. It's a must if you come here. The fried rice was made well and tasty at the same time. It wasn't overly saturated in salt or sauce. We also decided to go with the pan-fried pork Gyoza as an appetizer, which were really good, and I highly recommend.Service: 4 STARSThe service here was great! As we asked different vendors for recommendations, they were quick and friendly to give their top rated dishes based on what we were looking for. When I was unsatisfied with the pork buns, the server was quick to replace the meal for a different choice due to my dissatisfaction, which I greatly appreciate it.Ambience: 4 STARSThis place is a great meeting spot for groups or simply as a hang out location to grab some good food and drinks. We decided to come here on a Saturday afternoon, which surprisingly was not busy. The food court style and courtyard set up makes for a great atmosphere, especially with the live DJ. Overall 1-800 lucky is a good spot for a quick bite or to grab drinks with friends. What keeps us coming back is the Taiyaki ice cream cones!",
      "For awhile I have known about this place from IG, and so glad I had the opportunity to come here. This is a unique spot with different food options inside to choose from: ramen, dim sum, ice cream, drink bar, and more! Of course I had to try to fit as much food as I could ;) I saw that they have a DJ area outside which I'm told sometimes happens at night time so I'm sure it's a vibe. The ramen broth was very clean and flavorful, while the handmade noodles and soft boiled eggs balanced it out. Not pictured are the fried shui mai which I've never had before and was surprised how tasty it was! Love the eclectic decor and how fun it was to visit 1800-LUCKY.",
      "This is one of those places that just makes you feel cool. The small food hall features all Asian restaurants offering everything from sushi to bao buns, ramen, dumplings, pad Thai, wings and more. There's a big outdoor area and lots of seating inside, as well as a back bar for cocktails and a little stand offering Japanese canned sake and beers.Even though we stopped in here before heading to dinner, I had to get an order of soup dumplings to try. They were delicious. We also got Japanese beers for the table and a few of my friends shared sushi rolls that were being made right in front of us. The place was packed and the only reason I knocked off a star was because they had a huge event going on in the courtyard with a DJ that was insanely loud. Like bass-shaking-the-room-while-we-tried-to-eat-our-food loud. We could barely talk to each other, even though it was like 5pm. It was a fun experience overall though and I'd happily come back again in the future!",
      "Convenient food hall to sit comfortably with a group of friends in the Wynwood area and try different foods. Agree with some of the other reviewers that the food is hit or miss. It is pricey. The ramen, for instance, was not great. They didn't use real ramen noodles and the broth was a little simple tasting with not a lot of toppings.We got some dumplings from the dumpling vendor and they weren't bad. Pretty authentic home-made tasting. The spicy wontons are REALLY spicy, so beware!",
      "Been here several times when I'm at Wynwood.  I've tried every venue that's in there with the exception of the sushi  at since I don't eat seafood or fish. I love this spot because you have it all in one place, bar, dance floor, great food and ice cream. You have Chinese and Filipino food which is all really great."

      "MAKE RESERVATIONS!We went to CVI.CHE 105 on a Saturday night at 8:00p on a long weekend. The place was jam packed with music cranking and and a big line outside with people who did not have reservations trying to get in.  Why was this place packed with a huge line outside??? Well because  the Peruvian Food inside is an experience you stand on line for!Our waitress was amazing. Have us great advice and suggestions.  We started with a Passion Fruit Sangria and Na Colada.  Both were well balanced and refreshing.  Our app was delivered to the wrong table beside us (The guy said this looks at the calamari and raw white fish and says, \"This is nothing like I would have though!?!\" and just started eating away.  2 minutes later his potato app showed up....haha).  She yelled at the runner and got our app out 5 min later.   I've never been to a place before where you get hot food (Fried Calamari) and cold food (Raw White Fish) on the same plate.  Mix that with a creamy rocoto sauce & fresh pico that lit my pallet up like never before and you have the EL DE CARRETILLA that we ordered for an appetizer. Wow, wow, wow.  Flavor explosion!The CHAUFÓN DE MARISCOS with mixed seafood I ordered was enormous. I ate the mussels, scallops, shrimp & squid plus the perfectly cooked Fried Rice until I couldn't eat anymore.  The portion that remained in my bowl would have been more than enough to be the actual size of the meal itself!  My wife tried the  RISOTTO Y LOMO SALTADO.  She is a risotto snob and said it was amazing.  That wa the first time having Peruvian Risotto, but won't be the last.  It was cooked perfect,  but did have a little to much extra cheese on top.  The sirloin with the onions and peppers were delicious and we would highly recommend for someone not feeling too adventurous to try something out of their comfort zone.",
      "Oh my gosh, I think this is definitely one of the top five restaurants I've been to my entire life. This was my first venture into peruvian seafood which left me unlocking a new craving (ceviche)!! I loved everything we ate here and I'm so sad there's nothing like this restaurant close to where I live back at home.We were seated immediately (weekday in January) with no wait for dinner. The waiter was very knowledgeable and helped us choose the best dishes for sharing and which would let us try the most. The food also came out EXTREMELY fast. It came out within less than 15 -20 minutes I think?When you first arrive, there are complimentary corn nuts and bits of corn chips. Very interesting, reminds me of the leftover kernels of a microwaveable popcorn bag but they are more fluffy and easier to chew. Yum.Parihuela Amelcocha (5/5)Oh my goodness. This was one of my all time favorites. The warm risotto in the creamy seafood sauce on top of a bed of fresh seafood was to die for. I love how it came in a skillet which made the food taste more roasted and firey. Ugh this was so delicious, it somewhat reminds me of the Korean dish jjampong (seafood soup). Tastes very nostalgic and familiar but also warm and filling.Ceviche Chucuito (5/5)First time having ceviche, this definitely raised my expectations for this food. It was fresh and tangy from the acidic lime; a perfect bite of raw fish with the sauce. The sauce was delicious with the fish and onions. Also the octopus slices and scallop slices were fresh and delicious. Great sharing course and so delicious.Causa Traviesa (3.8/5)This was also tasty but I really didn't love it. Causa is a traditional peruvian mashed potato dish. It was good but compared to the other AMAZING dishes I think it lacked slightly. Tasted a bit like mash potatoes stuffed with some cold crab salad topped with the same ceviche as the other dish we ordered and with the same sauce. When I come to Miami in the future I will definitely make sure I stop by this restaurant again!!!",
      "Food the ceviche is tasty Soup of the house many different sea life in soup tasty Service is best in Aventura Mall Poor service in Lincoln Mall side of ceviche no the same",
      "Great restaurant we ate at for NYE. Best ceviche I've had in Miami. Very cool atmosphere, great vibes. Friendly staff with good service. Posh feel. Loud, but great for a night out with friends or significant other. Food: 5 stars  Uniqueness: 5 starts  Presentation: 5 stars  Flavor:  5 stars Service: 5 starsAtmosphere: 5 stars.",
      "This place was super packed! We went on a Saturday night at around 8, and every table was occupied. It was loud and so I wouldn't recommend it for a conversational dinner, but we were definitely there for the food. The food was good.We got the octopus appetizer and the mixed ceviche (3 varieties) with just fish. The food was overall quite good, with the arugula of the appetizer being the star (the vinaigrette they put on it was STELLAR). However, the octopus was excessively chewy-- both hard to cut and hard to chew. It was a little disappointing. The ceviches were yummy but one of the three had a lot of bones in it. The service was just okay. We had a reservation but they had a hard time finding us in the system, but they still seated us almost immediately. I just felt like they were giving a bit of attitude over not being able to find us in the system and were not very good at communicating what was going on. As for the waitstaff, our waitress was nice but she was hard to track down for more water (we often had to ask for more water), took forever for the check, and when we were ordering she left out the fact that getting mixed seafood in the ceviche was an up charge from fish. It was awkward because the table left to ours was also up sold without knowing, and they refused to pay it because they were deceived by the same waitress and they ended up splitting the difference with the restaurant. When they were trying to figure that out, the waitress was standing between our two tables with her behind practically touching my arm and I had to scoot over away to not be touched by her.Overall, I would possibly come back, but I do hope for a better experience next time.",
      "Suggested by my hotel front desk we decided to give it a try for dinner. The place very refined was packed (good sign)  but we got a table right away. Our server Irma was really friendly, informative and helpful. The food definitely over my expectations even if next time I'll be around I will have to try the ceviche mix I've seen in other tables. We ordered Pulpito A La Herradura, yummy octopus with potatoes, homini and fresh arugula. Then Untuoso Arroz Con Mariscales a great seafood risotto with very distinctive taste.. super The portions are generous and definitely it gets a thumb up",
      "Always consistent with great ambience, very fresh seafood and efficient service. A winning combination and always enjoyable dining here.",
      "My family has high recommendations for Cviche 105 from our close Peruvian family friends and it was delicious. We have come back a few times already now! The lomo saltado is always delicious and very comforting. Keep in mind portions are huge here!! Most definitely enough for at least 2-3 people to eat together. Their acevicheado roll is very delicious too! Seafood risotto was very seafood tasting if you like that.",
      "Cviche 105 was definitely a favorite from Miami. It was so good our group came twice on the trip-- cancelling a different reservation to come back! The Lomo Saltado was amazing and giant portioned (great for sharing) and the ceviche was very fresh and tasty as well. However the hidden gem was definitely the sushi! It was very u expected but the ceviche roll was so delicious! The other roll with plantains on top was great as well! 10/10 recommend giving cviche 105 a try!",
      "Trendy spot .  Lots in menu I wished to try . Portions were large . I had a trilogy of seafood ceviche that we both shared .  Was fairly full with that .  Seafood risotto was nice but the ceviche was the star . My wife had pasta with pesto and steak . They do have a children's menu option .  Again large portion but she loved it .  Indoor and outdoor seating available. Would definitely go again",
      "Seriously good Peruvian food--we were blown away! At first when we came we were a bit turned off by the high price tag: most of the dishes are over $25 and some are even over $50! But when I say the portions make up for it, I truly mean that the portions make up for it. We ended up getting a lomo saltado for my boyfriend and an aji de gallina for me. There was probably a whole pound of shredded chicken in my dish--if I'd wanted to split it into two or three meals, I could have done so comfortably.The flavor in both dishes is the star of the show: the lomo saltado was rich and complex, and the aji de gallina was hearty and comfy. I could eat both dishes forever. One thing to note is that the waiter will explain the $90 dishes at the very beginning to try to entice you to order them. These dishes are not meant to be appetizers but are probably large enough for multiple people to share as their main course. If you choose to go down this path, don't order additional entrees on top--you're not going to finish!"

      "My friend took me out to dinner but they didn't read the fine print (apparently they changed the menu recently too). It's definitely more of a lounge to get small bites than for a place to go if you're hungry looking for a fully satisfying dinner. No problem with that, just good to know. Anyway, dope ambiance, couch seating, low tops and high bar tables - they have hookah! I could see myself coming here for hookah, drinks and a few snacks. So in short, eat before you come. The menu is very limited. I liked the Champagne Cocktail which is brandy, grand marnier and Prosecco (surprise). It was strong but also still a bit light - very sippable. The gin cucumber Prosecco drink tasted good but I wasn't running back for a second. We had the wagyu steak which comes out on a hot stone plate so I'd recommend ordering it more rare because it keeps cooking on the plate. I wish they had other sides like mashed potatoes but it was only just fries and this mediocre salad.",
      "Shanice, thank you for taking the time to leave us your comments. We're glad to know our Champagne Cocktail was to your liking. We hope to serve you again very soon.",
      "Let's start. Our server was very nice, friendly. The drinks were good. I did not enjoy the food. Ordered the burger and I swear the Pattie's were the size of McDonald's Big Mac. First 3 bites all bread and dry. When I finally got to the meat, no flavor. SMH All of our food came out at different times. One of the meals came out after everyone else had finished. Then another person got their appetizer after that! Ridiculous. Not satisfied at all and now I have to go find food! Oh and I've written this entire review and still haven't seen our server. She's nice, but no where to be found. Should we just leave?Wait so let's add more. The bill comes and they charged us $10 for a bottle of water. Apparently when you ask for water they bring a bottle that looks fancy but is not. If you don't ask for that, you don't get a glass of water. Added 18% gratuity for a waitress we saw once to take the order. So angry at this place.",
      "Such a good hidden gem at the edge of brickell. The vibe is so fun- outdoor seating, a GREAT happy hour and great new bottomless Saturday brunch ($35 mimosas). Our server Melanie was the BEST- so attentive and overall great service.Would def recommend!!!",
      "Melanie, thank you for taking the time to review our restaurant. It means a lot to us when new customers join us and enjoy their meal in every aspect of it. We hope to see you again soon.",
      "Didn't really enjoy the experience. The drink and food quality are pretty poor and our waiter barely checked on us. We sat outside and that's where the hard core brunching goes on but its a pretty young crowd.",
      "Pretty impressed with this place! Went here to celebrate a friend's birthday. It was the perfect vibe--dim lighting, good drinks, decent music, good food & service! They brought over a happy birthday sign and tiramisu! I had low expectations for the tiramisu, but I think it was actually my favorite thing I had here. The drinks were amazing! We tried the mojitos and a few prosecco drinks which were all really refreshing and made with just the right ratios. The mushroom pizza was alright. The crust was extremely thin so it became cold and soggy very fast. THE TRUFFLE FRIES! Very generous amount and the perfect amount of seasoning. I would say the quinoa salad was the least impressive of the meal. Not bad, but nothing special. Also where is the quinoa? It was 95% arugula. I do love arugula so I'm not complaining, but if you don't like arugula, order a different salad :)",

When we walked in, we were immediately seated and then greeted by our server, Desi.  She was spectacular. What amazing service from beginning to end.  She was extremely friendly, attentive and open to our substitutions.  There was a nice vibe and the crowd was very good looking (extra bonus there.) my friend had a dog and they even made sure to bring the dog water which was very nice.  We had truffle flat bread with prosciutto and it was beyond delicious!!! We also enjoyed the empanadas which were ok.  The tuna tar tar was excellent as well.  There was lounge music in the background and I truly was floored by the entire staff.  They all watched the tables and made sure that you never had to ask for a refill or anything else.  Thank you Segafredo for your exceptional staff and a great experience.  I will definitely be back!   (I went on a Friday night in case you all were wondering) PS if you like Martinis the cucumber martini was divine and very refreshing!!!",
      "It was Girls Night Out and we chose Barsecco's for our hangout tonight. Good choice! We had a great time. Although we arrived too late for dinner, we did have some good drinks like Tito's and MargaritasGood Latin music plus some Top 40! The outdoors area was cool with the DJ doing his thing, a seating area, hookah area and IG opportunities.  There was a younger enthusiastic crowd dancing and enjoying the night. We enjoyed the bar area with the bartender who was showing his tricks for the crowd. The vibe was great and the decor was really cool. We are definitely going back!",

The service is top notch, and the food is the best there is. Although this restaurant is heavily priced. It is well worth it.

Pricey $$$ but completely word it.",
      "Komodo was a profoundly bad restaurant. Not sure how anyone could rate it five stars, between the unhelpful front desk staff, reservation system, and quality of food for the price Im not sure which is worse. The only good thing about our night was our server Joel, he was very helpful and great all around for whatever we needed.Despite having a reservation we had to wait more than an hour to be seated. The front desk staff was so unhelpful, and we went up to them almost 5 times to follow up on when we would be seated. It wasn't until we said we were going to leave that they seated us. Not to mention in a few of the times the girl ignored us for others, which made it hard to even get help.The system is that you get there, go wait in the packed crowd, and a staff member is supposed to be able to just find you to seat you. Which is extremely inefficient and is easy for someone to just lie and take your spot. A text system would work better and give you the freedom to be able to walk around while you wait, but it seems they want to keep you there to add to the \"hype\" of it seeming packed. I had other places to be, and Komodo made us late. They need to either control the amount of tables they book or fix the system they have, because it's unacceptable. I wanted to give it a chance and see if the food was even worth itI have no problem spending on good food. Or even if the food isn't that great but the service is good, I can come to terms with it. But Komodo was a let down. The rolls and krispy rice tasted like something from RA sushi. The food was mediocre at best, there is SO many better spots in Miami if your paying the same price point; that wont put you through a ridiculous wait or bad service. Do better",

      "We originally had reservations for papi steak for my sister's birthday dinner months in advance but were notified days in advance that they had to cancel our reservations due to an event during art Basel weekend. Keep in mind, we we're traveling out of state to come here and this was my first time visiting Florida so major bummer. We were rerouted here as it is their sister restaurant. I had a couple of drinks that did not disappoint, namely the tropical garden. So good! While we were waiting for our table I noticed a rice dish that looked so good and I was determined to find out what it was because I was ordering it. It was the special fried rice. I also ordered the Chilean sea bass and I've gotta say, the food did not disappoint. It was tasty and flavorful. The staff was also really nice. Shout out to Shane? I think",

      "Trendy Asian fusion restaurant in Brickell. Came here with a group of five during a girl's trip, and this place was really busy. We had a reservation for 9pm but we waited for 25 minutes by the bar alongside the crowd while the hostesses went through the list (you can tell if you're up next by checking the printed receipts on the side of the hostess stand). Indoor and outdoor dining is available. It's definitely a scene but the vibes were fun and there's a club inside where you can go after to dance off the food. Food was served family-style and it's pan-Asian-inspired. There's an automatic 20% service charge included. We had the following and had a little bit of leftovers:Lobster dynamite: very tasty, I would get these again. Pastrami egg rolls: these came in four pieces; apparently it's a signature dish but I didn't think it was anything to write home about Sticky ribs: nice flavor and was a heftier option Truffle mushroom: very light and a good vegetarian option Dragon roll: your standard sushi roll with avocado Korean fried chicken: this came in three and similar in flavor profile to the ribs; I liked them Special fried rice: a solid accompaniment for the meat dishes Crispy brussel sprouts: To be honest, I didn't really like these. The flavor was off. Japanese cheesecake: it's the fluffy cheesecake with the server making a ceremony or pouring the berry glaze on top. A lighter dessert. Miso temptation: I told the girls that if ever met someone that made me feel the way this chocolate mousse cake dessert made me feel, I would marry them immediately. Definitely get.",
      "Komodo consistently impresses me. I have tried close to all things on the menu on multiple different occasions and I always leave very happy. The service staff is friendly and will accommodate your requests or any allergies. Most recently I went with a group with multiple allergies and the staff not only communicated it to the kitchen and made changes to the dish, but also went out of their way to provide a hand-written version of items that met all intolerances. The Asian Chicken Salad is a must try!! One of my favorite salads, such a big portion, filling, and tasty. The sushi is fresh, well-prepared, and flavorful, you cannot go wrong with it. The pecking duck is crispy on the outside and the meat is tender and so flavorful. Not to mention, the cocktails are strong and very well made. Worth the hype and always a treat!"

      "I live near by and constantly come here, I love the Mar y Tierra burrito and they have a great selection of beers. I do have to say however many encounters at this facility have been sour due to rude cashier service. The gentleman refused to serve a 23 year old a beer after clearly showing him the FLORIDA VALID SMART ID, he even went as far as telling them he would not accepted as he had training the day before. I myself have taken said required training and they educate you on this option as well as a traditional ID. Within this same experience a person in need I often see in my area and have a relationship with, on this day he asked my best friend and I for food. When he came to get the food inside the facility the staff member insisted our friend leave and when my best friend explained we had bought him food she had the audacity to say \"you don't know him\". So inconsiderate and nosy...She actively tried to make a scene by shouting this out and making someone feel worse about their situation. This will most likely be my last time at the taco stand or at least until they employ more understanding and humble people.",
      "I was really craving tacos after a night out during Art Basel and saw this place was packed and after walking a little down the block I noticed there were 2 other taco spots but The Taco Stand really caught my eye after checking out their Instagram, out of all the taco spots this one was the most authentic. I tried the Al Pastor and Pollo Asado tacos. I really liked the Al Pastor, it felt like I was back in Mexico City. But the Pollo Asado really hit it out of the park! I was so impressed because chicken tacos are usually dry and kinda bland in my opinion but these tacos were so full of flavor and the chicken was well seasoned and juicy. It was really the best pollo asado tacos I've had in Miami. It gets pretty packed here but if you have a little patience, I promise you won't regret it! This is my new favorite taco spot and I can't wait to be back.",

Too many other good places in Miami to deal with that. Bye. A",
      "So much potential. Was in town for a little vacation from Los Angeles and my wife had a craving for/found this spot in Wynwood.  Took an uber from South Beach.. hopped in line.. was about 6 ppl ahead of us and we were outside outside the door to begin (not too bad though).  Took about 20 min to place our order.  It was very busy inside so my thinking was \"cool, that's a great sign!!\".  As we got closer to the menu, we begin deciding on our order choices, opting for 2 asada tacos, 1 chicken taco, 1 asada fries, 1 Squirt, 1 Corona, that cane out to about $36.  Additionally -kind of related/kind of not, the lady who took our seemed pretty standoffish towards us for some reason (kinda weird, but whatever lol). After a pretty significant wait (20-25 min approximately):  we received our order and unfortunately, every item we ordered was either room temperature or cold!  all meats: cold.  fries: room temp.  cheese sauce (asada fries): cold.  it pretty bad!!  I feel like the flavor was ok/good.. but hard to accurately gauge when the meats are cold. After looking them up -I discovered they have a California location so I will look to give them another try here on the west coast.  Side note: my wife said it may have been the worst Mexican food she's ever had (a bit dramatic in my opinion), so she probably won't be joining in, lol.  My sentiments are if only we could've gotten at least some semi-warm foods, it would've made the selections a bit better. Again: so much potential :-/",
      "Great hole in the wall kind of place with lines out of the door.. menu is Tacos( duh!) burritos, chips and guacamole and loaded nachos.We had a variety of tacos- all good except the mushroom one .. but the sauce bar made up for it. The best sauces are chipotle and spicy ( not for faint of heart!)..Burritos were excellent and Shrimp and fish tacos tasted great as well..",
      "Anytime a small place has a line out the door, it catches my attention. Went here for lunch as it's down the street from my office and man did The Taco Stand deliver on the goods! Reasonably priced with generous portions and top quality ingredients. I had three tacos and my co works had the burritos, we also split the 'mar y Tierra' fries which were incredible. Trust the crowd and jump in line for the best, most authentic Mexican food in Miami!",
      "I live in San Francisco and have access to the mission's best tacos and burritos. But wow the taco stand in Miami brought those flavors, and may have done it even better. Their salsa bar is unbeatable, with must try pickled onions and black pepper, habanero spicy salsa, chipotle sauce and pickled jalapeños. The absolute best taco was definitely the baja fried fish, followed by the Al pastor (which has pieces of pineapple). There is a long line to get inside and the food takes a bit of time but stay to get the tacos, Al pastor burrito and the large, crispy churros with condensed milk.",

      "My New York snobbery really shows when I travel and is something I'm working on, but it was put to the test when I had lackluster meal after meal while in Miami. Most likely I just didn't know where to go, but was intrigued by this ultra popular taco spot that always had a line at any given time of day, and day of the week. Could all these people be wrong?While the taco I had the previous night was sad and bland, the shrimp tacos here were full of life. Caramelized onions, sautéed peppers, and plenty of spices complemented the seared and spiced pieces of shrimp in each taco. I wanted a second order.With so many restaurants in the city I'm mostly focused on trying new places, but may just make a detour for a taco here on my next trip to Miami. They were that good."

      "Had New Years Eve dinner here.  My daughter is really picky about seafood, most of which is not to her liking.  But, everything was just really really well done.Standouts are the cornbread, the shrimp cocktail.  The shrimp were just really tender and flavorful; perfectly cooked.  The entrees were again, very well cooked, great taste, and well presented and composed.  The crab cakes were very different in that they were fried with a breading.  Don't know enough about the area to say whether this is normal but it certainly is different than the northeast.  Nevertheless, it was quite good.  Only qualm is... it SEEMED rushed.  It wasn't, but food came out really quickly... we ate quickly... i just don't know why?  We were out of there in just over an hr, where I would have thought it would be a 2 hr or so meal",
      "Really wasn't impressed. I had been dying to try Mignonette as I continuously was hearing from multiple sources that it was top tier food. Several friends told me how much they love this place, but I'm not sure if it left a great impression. Lobster deviled eggs were good, but incredibly salty. Not quite worth $24. The oysters were alright. We ordered the flight. I don't know a lot about oysters, so I won't comment too heavily on them. Noticed a few bits of shell. Cornbread tasted more like a cake. Not in a good way. It wasn't rich in corn flavor like I was expecting. It looks so appetizing in pictures, but it just fell flat in flavor. We ordered a lobster roll and it was incredibly dry. I guess dry is better than soggy with butter. Atmosphere is super hip. Love the ambiance of the old gas station renovated into a restaurant. Parking is easy and right on site. I don't see myself going back here. I can see how it got good reviews on a good day, but it's too risky. Why dine somewhere that seems to be 50/50 on whether or not you'll get a great meal? I came across an interesting mix of reviews. It seems like when they're on their A game, the food is a 10. On the day we went, the food was a 6.",
      "This was my first time here. My daughter suggested it. She says it was one of her favorite seafood restaurants. I'm glad we took her advice. My family loves oysters. They had at least 10 choices to choose from. They included oysters from the west coast as well as the east coast. We opted for the seafood tower that included a dozen from both coasts.  They were fresh & delicious.  The crudo for the day was also included & it was excellent. Our waiter Eric made excellent entree suggestions. He was also friendly & attentive! The whole staff was very professional. The food was amazing! We ordered the whole fish of the day, the Dorado, the black grouper & the crab cakes. Everything was outstanding! Cudos to the chef!",
      "Finishing up my backlog of reviews from my recent time in Miami a few weeks ago, I found Mignonette to be a snazzy little restaurant with charming date night vibes. It's not located in a super busy neighborhood, and we were able to find some street parking nearby.The decor is whimsically cheeky, and they had a good selection for the raw bar as well as for beers. This place was absolutely packed on a Friday night, and we opted to sit at the bar because it was the only spot available without a reservation. The bar seating is a bit tight, we were right next to the bar sink and some cakes in display stands, so a table would definitely have been preferred.We got a dozen of oysters, and the jumbo lump crab meat from the menu. The oysters were pretty good with a wide variety, fresh and came with a great sauce selection. I was less impressed with the lump crab meat though, it was served in a glass bowl (like a fish bowl type of bowl) over ice. It comes with an assortment of sauce (my favorite was the melted butter) but I wish it was a bit underwhelming given the price.I'd give Mignonette a true 3.5/5, not mindblowingly amazing but a hip place for some good oysters if you are down in the Miami area.",
      "Been wanting to try this place for a while and saw a post on my Instagram feed featuring the most beautiful African lobster tails....so I immediately made a dinner reservation for my boyfriend and I for Friday night. We opted for a bottle of wine to start and ordered some apps. We opted for crab cakes and octopus. The octopus portion was microscopic and the sauces completely drowned out the flavor (octopus is something I order almost every time I go out to eat, and this must've been the lowest rated one I've had in Miami thus far.) The crab cakes were good alot of crab lumps and not much filler. I really enjoyed my lobster tails and the cheese polenta was very satisfying. My boyfriend did not enjoy his lobster roll it was pretty dry for him unfortunately. Overall very hit and miss meal. Service was good food was meh. I would be open to getting the lobster tails again via takeout, but overall pretty disappointed with the dining experience.",
      "What a charming little spot. This is a great date night place. They have a really great menu for seafood lovers. I especially enjoyed the crudo, which changes daily. The cornbread is also excellent. The list of sides is even full of good choices like artichokes, lentils, peas, potato chips, and a ton of options. I'm only docking a star because it wasn't the best lobster roll I've ever had (a little dry) but everything was delicious.",
      "Recently had one of the BEST dinners in recent memory! Not sure why it took me so long to try this place out, but I can't wait to come back. Arrived at prime time on a Friday night and the restaurant wasn't extremely packed but had a decent amount of tables filled. We were waiting on some friends to join but we were sat promptly by the friendly Hostess. It can sometimes be hard in Miami to find things that stand the test of time when it comes to service and food, and Mignonette does just that. Both service and food were phenomenal. Our server was super friendly and quick at getting us what we needed. All of the dishes were so delicious, that a lot of \"OMG\" was said at the table. I wanted to order fish or a seafood plate but the filet mignon was too hard to pass up and I'm so glad I didn't because it was perfection, it was perfectly seared and those potatoes were a great addition to it as a side. I didn't want the meal to end. I however did try the fish plates that were ordered at the table and wow, so fresh and tasty as well. If you like seafood, especially oysters, then this is the place to be at.  I was also a big fan of the lobster bisque soup, had a little kick to it but in a good way! Was delicious and had a good amount of lobster pieces in it, so did the lobster mac and cheese. The second highlight 2/2 was the chocolate cake. I'm not one for too chocolatey cakes, but this cake was probably one of the most moist, tasteful cakes I've ever tasted. So delicious and surprisingly not overwhelmingly sweet! A MUST TRY AS WELL! That crust of the key lime pie hit the spot too, and so did the bread pudding! In other words, there was nothing we tried here that didn't hit the spot and that we didn't absolutely enjoy.Whether you want to happy hour after a long day of work or to just enjoy a seafood filled dinner or find a spot for a romantic date- this spot hits home for all occasions.",
      "AMAZING!!!! , The atmosphere was very nice and the service was great. We had a very nice waitress. She was very attentive and even gave us a lot of water which we really like because the alcohol was flowingAs far as dishes, they were absolutely incredible. Everything we ate was from the  Miami spice menu. We went in a group, so we each got a different plates & atecoff each others and everything was excellent. The redfish was great. The grouper was crispy and soft. The lobster mac & cheese was outstanding, and the filet mignon was top-notch. The desserts were so good. That chocolate cake was soft, moist and tasty. The Keylime pie was one of the best as a born and raised Florifian, and the bread pudding was on point.Highly recommended. Will definitely go again worth it.",
      "The service was the best part of the experience. There really isn't much ambiance, the food is overpriced, and I don't think they can compete with restaurants in a similar price range. The fried shrimp had no seasoning. I originally wanted the lobster roll but they had run out. My partner had the cod and said the portion size was extremely small. I wanted to like this place because I had heard so much about it. Unfortunately, I can't recommend it.",
      "I searched to find a nice place to have dinner while we were in Miami; the site caught my eye due to the lobster and oysters on the menu. We ended up walking to the restaurant; it is kind of hidden away but very worth the visit. We were seated on the far side, quickly looked over the menu, heard the specials, and ordered up. Drinks: House Aperitif - 4/5Zuccardi Malbec - 5/5Oysters: Kusshi - 5/5Lucky Lime - 5/5Pickle Pt - 5/5The oysters were fresh and very delicious. Seared scallops - 5/5Seared nicely, on top of cheesy Polenta.Lobster roll with French fired potato chips and Polenta - 5/5 The Lobster roll was terrific, melted in my mouth, rich and creamy on a brioche bun, and came with two very delicious sides.Manhattan Strip with sautéed Mushrooms, Polenta - 5/5The strip was perfectly cooked to a medium-rare, with two sides mushrooms and cheesy Polenta."

      "VEGETARIANS: The Spicy Vegan Miso is one of best ramen I have ever had. It's been a sad vegetarian ramen journey for me as the broth for vegetarian ramen is usually pretty bland. The spicy vegan miso here is anything but bland! Someone actually paid attention to the flavors and ingredients. I have had this place several  times now; it's consistently delicious. Highly recommend!My husband recommends the Tan Tan ramen for non-vegetarians.",
      "Momosan is a must try place for brunch! However, I recently went for dinner and it was alright. We both ordered ramen, which was filling and a good portion for $16 (in Miami). She got the Vegan Spicy Miso and I got the Tokyo Chicken. The waiter misheard my order and served me a Tonkotsu. It looked great, but I don't eat pork so I sent it back.I thought the Tokyo chicken was so-so. It needed some acidity to cut through the saltiness of the broth. Though, I really enjoyed the noodles. I also tried my friend's order. I liked it better :) On a Thursday night, you can expect less customers & less waiters. It's a nice change of pace from the hustle and bustle of brunch. All in all, it's worth checking out. Maybe try both brunch and dinner to see which you prefer!",
      "Momosan is the best ramen I've ever had.  Opened by Iron Chef Morimoto, the food lives up to the hype.  Their sushi and hot food is also amazing.  There are very few things on the menu I haven't tried, because I take advantage of their bottomless brunch!  They offer bottomless brunch including unlimited drinks AND food.  It is incredible.The service can be a little poor sometimes, and the last two times I've been the air conditioning has been broken.  But, the food is incredible and it is usually not crowded.",
      "hands down best ramen i've had in awhile.. its a good thing i don't live close to this place because i don't think i have the self control to not eat here atleast once a week. We ordered gyozas to start and sticky ribs- both really stood out to us! the sticky ribs are perfection, many places have them on their menus but only a hand full can successfully make them. Another nice thing about this restaurant is the atmosphere, you can dress in heels or in a hoodie you'll never be underdressed or overdressed! the whole place has an elevated cafeteria vibe which in my personal opinion its a very cool concept.",
      "Momosan was a nice place to get ramen in Wynwood - I really enjoyed the Spicy Vegan Ramen. The broth was a bit creamy with a balance of sweet and savory & the fried tofu added the perfect bite. Also, the noodles were the BEST texture! Compared to other ramen dishes I've had in Miami it was good, however, it was not the most crave-able and there was really only one vegetarian option available. But all in all, I would go again for the chill ambience with friends & for $16 it was good portion size.",
      "I came back because of how impressed I was with this place. How it is the only authentic ramen in Florida. I was utterly disappointed. The pandemic made them cut costs everywhere but kept the menu price the same. At the time of my return, I didn't know this. The noticeable cuts were less quality eggs. No longer the rising sun red egg, but normal egg. I'm okay with it, because you still get a perfectly boiled egg. And biggest cut was portion amount. I remember my first visit, I had enough for left overs and after this time, I was still hungry and had to go home to eat something else. This place has turned into a tapas place. Definitely no longer worth the price. The flavor is still there at least. But I have sadly been priced out to come more often.",
      "I posted photos but forgot to write a review! This is my favorite and only authentic place to get ramen in Florida. I have yet to find another authentic place. If you know of one, message me. I came right before opening and waited outside while watching them have their pep talk or meeting. It was a rather rainy, humid typical Florida day. I wanted to be there early to find parking and get the rib ramen. I was there for only the ramen, but the waitress was highly suggesting we order apps as well. Unfortunately, I'm not the typical Miami rich person they are marketing towards. Just a normal blue collared honest worker who doesn't make much. We debated trying iron chefs selection of sake or the apps and decided on ordering apps. We would of liked to order both but we'll come back to try the alcohol for next time. We opted for the soft shell crab and the conch ceviche. The soft shell was very flavorful and delicious. Apparently their most popular. The conch was pictured being served in a beautiful shell but it came out in one of those dishes you get from the diner that serves tar tar sauce. For the price, and for the location I was surprised and very disappointed in the flavor and the way it was served. I should of known by the way waitress reacted to me asking how the conch was, I should not have ordered it. On to the ramen:I don't know how this place isn't more popular. The ramen IS THE BEST IVE EVER HAD. I've been to a lot of ramen places and most always fail in one of the components. The broth, the noodle, the meat, the egg. It reminded me so much of Japan. I could cry. I would go once a week if my wallet would allow. The broth is rich, and you can taste the amount of bones that was rendered for hours. The noodle had the perfect biteMeat was beautifully tender and seasonedThe egg looked like it came straight from Japan because it had the iconic rising sun yolk. The cooking time was perfect. I could order a whole dish of these eggs and eat it with rice. But I know that's not the type of place iron chef wants to have lol. Hope this place is able to stay afloat and be busy because it's the only place I am able to get a good bowl of ramen-the flavor, amount of food is all spot on. Can't wait to return!",
      "Miami vibes brought us here for appetizers while we were in the area. Plus, this spot is frequented by the chef himself, Morimoto!  We missed him by a week! :(This was on my list of must dos while in Miami and it is everything! The ambiance is gorgeous! Love all the details! However, it's a bit pricy and the area is a bit sketchy. Japanese food with rice dishes, sushi, appetizers and ramen are available! BIG selection of sake & cocktails. Soft Shell Bao - soft shell crab, lettuce, pickles, spicy mayo - this was good but a bit pricy for the 1 pc baoHamachi Tacos - 2 bite mini tacos! These tasted amazing! Super fresh! Surf & Turf Roll - table side seared! It was a fun experience! The roll was yummy! Definite get! Butterfly Effect - Fords gin, processo, lemongrass, lemon - WOW & Beautiful! Definitely must try! Lycheejito - Lychee, lime, mint, ginger beer - yum! Momosan Iced Tea - blueberry, calpico, tea - yum! John was the bestest! Great personality, great service and knowledgeable!  Gave a great recommendation of the Surf & Turf roll!  Make sure to get him! Parking was easy to find on the street and you can pay through the parking apps.Recommended!",
      "We probably went on an \"off\" night.  The service was so choppy -from not getting ordered drinks to asking if we were ready to leave even though the main courses hadn't arrived. Another couple waited outside over an hour to be served. Then add onto that the broken air conditioner and it made for a sloppy experience. We ordered several things: kakuni bao, poke bowl, Tonkotsu, tempura roll and a tune roll. Everything was good except the tasteless poke bowl. It's missing unagi sauce or something!Outside of that, the food really was great! It's really the front end crew that needs some help 'cause the kitchen crew was banging it out!!",
      "Ramen review!! I'd been eyeing this place for a while because I've been in search of authentic Asian food in Miami, and ramen so far has been a hard pass at most places. It's rare that Miami triggers ramen cravings but as soon as the weather turned I was there. As far as Ramen in Miami, this is the best one by a pretty wide margin (disagree? I wanna hear about it because I'd love more recs) I ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen with the spice ball on the side. The broth was rich and flavorful and the noodles were nice and chewy (the thick kind. Generally not my favorite, but good for what they were). One of the toppings was the pickled greens that are in 牛肉麵 Beef noodle soup or pork belly bao, which seemed odd at first, but it kind melds in nicely once you let it soak. The egg had a sweeter profile but was well executed. The spicy yuzu ball had a really nice flavor to it - citrus and spicy, and their chili oil also has a fragrance to it. The spicy Tonkotsu uses both of these, plus then dandan spice, but I wanted to try the broth on its own. I did end up feeling quite heavy at the end, and the price point is pretty high (maybe not by Miami's baseline) so I'd say it's not an every day or even regular eater despite how close I live. The staff was so super nice and friendly, happy to chat but also happy to leave you alone.",
      "The brunch here is an excellent deal, because, honestly, don't you always go to Momosan and can't make up your mind what to order because you want everything? Well, now you can!! Or, if you haven't tried Momosan, this is a great way to be introduced to all the different dishes they have to offer. Their AYCE brunch includes most of the items on their regular menu, but in smaller portion.The sticky ribs is my favorite - the sauce is finger licking good and the meat is succulent with the right amount of fat.  Of course, you have to order the ramen.  I don't suppose I have to rave about the ramen, as some many other reviewers have done that already. They come in a smaller potion, so you don't have to worry about getting full on the noodles when it's AYCE. Unfortunately, I find that the hot appetizers and meat dishes are so much better than their sushi.  In a city with plenty of Peruvian places, they should don't call their dish ceviche if they can't make at least a decent one.  For the tartare, the fish looked so gray and dull I was concerned enough to leave it uneaten. That said, there's still plenty to choose from to get you filled up and more."

Boyfriend surprised me with a birthday dinner here and I couldn't have been more exited considering reservations are hard to come by. (Art Basel 2022 weekend) The hospitality was amazing and impeccable. Can't wait till a Gekko opens up in Los Angeles (that's was my birthday wish) Highly recommend the Japanese milk bread to start that will set the tone for the quality of what's to come. Loved the themed drinks (bad bunny song titles) he's co owner 12/10 in my book",
      "I can honestly say the food is genuinely delicious, despite the place being mainly known as \"bad bunny's restaurant\" lol. I loved the tako tacos (octopus). 2 per order and could've definitely gone for another round. The lobster dumplings were also super yummy and plump. The sushi - spectacular. Could not go wrong with either. Dessert was great- not too sweet. For me, the only two cons: the steak fries were whatever and I did not enjoy my cocktail, heavy rotation. I changed it for a classic vodka soda and it didn't do it for me either. Reservations are a must. Service is super attentive. It was a little silly that they charged my party of two $20 for water lol but the bouginess is part of the experience.",
      "My sister was in town and discovered this new spot on yelp and since we were in Brickell city center it was close by to dine. We ended up making a 6pm reservation. This is a red velvet rope at the door and they sat us by the sushi bar. There are three different areas including one that is a lounge in the back. The place is very dark with a lot of red decor. After we were seated our waiter came to give us menus. They have an extensive wine list. We ended up getting an unfiltered bottle of sake. The menu prices are exorbitant but we expected that for this one and done type venue that was opened by bad bunny and Grutman and is a japanese steakhouse concept. The menu was limited and they were not accommodating to vegans or vegetarians. No appetizer option other than the edamame, one entree option and just sides. It's 2023 people , besides Miami being a healthy city, with climate change veganism is on the rise.The milk bread - good but not epic, didn't understand why this has bonito flakesThe edamame- tasty.The sides- corn, potatoes purée, eggplant all MEH and not life changing. My sister is a vegan chef and was quite disappointed that they weren't able to accommodate small requests The most disappointment was the $92 lobster that was tiny and the size of my hand and came out on an embarrassing large plate overdressed with mayo and tons of topping masking any lobster flavor .  Not only was it not market value, it also was disgusting. The only reason I gave this a 2 was after we complained they removed the lobster charge and comped desserts - but with mediocre food and small portions, we went home hungry and won't be back when there wee better options just in Brickell and the grove.",
      "Clearly I am here for Benito. Overall I had a wonderful experience having my birthday dinner here. I did make an 8:30pm reservation and was not seated until after 9:30. We ordered the oysters, wagyu steak, fries, wagyu dumplings, plant based noodles, & lobster fried rice. I was not a fan of the matcha cheesecake but overall the rest of the food was good. I liked that we ordered a variety to try a little bit of everything. For drinks we got the beber conmigo & the café con leche had nice presentation. I'd come back maybe to try anything new on the menu or to bring anyone that hasn't been.",
      "Been here a few times and I have to say the food is top notch. Every thing is delicious and exquisite. Sushi melts in your mouth... 24 karat goldleaf adorns this and that... ambience on point... service on fleek!",
      "Came here for my birthday dinner on a Tuesday, had reservations for 7pm. We were seated promptly up on arrival. The entire staff was nice, welcoming and professional which was a great. We ordered several starters: -Spicy bluefin tuna roll which was amazing, best I've had. Highly recommend.-Waygu fried dumpling which was just ok but my husband loved it. -Japanese milk bread was amazing as well. It was soft and filled with lots of flavor. Highly recommended.For the entrees we had:-The crispy snapper which was ok, it was a bit on the salty side.-Ny strip-Lobster fried rice for our side -Dessert we had the dulce de leche lava cake. The drinks were also really good. I had the \"tuski mi, tuski you.\"Overall great experience for my birthday dinner. Ambience, service, drinks and food were all good.",
      "This restaurant was truly amazing!Came here for my birthday and wow everything we ordered was absolutely delicious. My favorite was the lobster dumplings and the spicy tuna sushi roll, you can literally taste how fresh the tuna was ! The dulce de leche mousse cake definitely hit the spot as well, super warm and moist it went perfect with the ice cream. The filet mignon was one of the best I've ever had, cooked to the right temperature & super tender.Our waiter Jorge was great, he took his time to explain everything on the menu, and recommended some dishes also, his customer service was spectacular for a party of 8, 10/10.The ambiance was super chill, it was a Monday night and they mostly played house music. The vibes was on point, also you might catch a couple celebrities there as well. This place is pretty pricey so expect your bill to be up there but sooo worth it and I  will definitely be coming back again soon."

I had the lamb chops because they were out of the chicken when I visited. Luckily, it was a hit. The meat was tender and it was well seasoned. The sides did steal the show though - the whipped potatoes and asparagus were perfect.The decor of the venue was perfect for the occasion and for some great photos.",

      "What a fun spot!! We were dancing, eating and drinking the night away! Loved the live music and the fire dancers. Sometime places like this with a nice ambiance will have sub-par food, but not here! The food was excellent. I'd have to say the Truffle & Pear pizza was my favorite. I also enjoyed my branzino - it was perfectly cooked. We ended up ordering the truffle fries for a round two because we couldn't get our hands off them! So good! The only issue was that it was hard to get our waitress' attention sometimes to order more drinks/food but she was so friendly and matched the high energy of the place.",
      "Restaurants on the water sometimes have bad food, because they can get away with it when the location is so desirable, but we were delighted to discover that the food here was delicious! Everything we ordered was good, but the lamb was exceptional and the chocolate nemesis totally stole the show. They had a DJ and the music was *very* loud, the place definitely had an upscale party vibe. The cocktails were well balanced and the service was attentive. Will definitely return here for a fun night out with friends on the water!",
      "The food here is always amazing, and I absolutely love the live music every-time I visit. However, my 3 star rating is due to the service. Every time I've visited the service has been so underwhelming, especially on our last visit. Our server was incredibly rude. I think the servers should be trainer a little better. Aside of this, the actual food, drinks, music and views are amazing!My favorite things to get here include the pear and truffle pizza, the mushroom risotto, lobster ravioli and tuna tartare.",

      "What an amazing spot, we absolutely LOVED it. It's fairly young and trendy, so I would not take my baby boomer parents here (or a baby in general)- but for a younger, fun, lively crowd, this is perfect. The inside is really cool - lots of artwork, somewhat hidden restaurant, similar to a speakeasy. The drinks were unique and incredible and the food was OUTSTANDING! Very gastronomic - if you're into that sort of thing (my parents wouldn't get it). We basically ordered the entire menu, until we nearly exploded. Here were a few memorable plates (as in, those I can remember after imbibing for a few hours)...Spanglish milk bread - the black salt on top. WOW. They say, once you go black (salt), you never go back right? Exactly. The guava butter was unlike any butter I have ever had. It's very tropical, and fruity! Wagyu beef ravioli - that blue cheese sauce was to die for - take some of that milk bread and drunk your bread in this sauce to your heart's desire (and worry about the consequences later, because bread and cheese, whew!) Nitro Watermelon Tataki - the only remotely healthy thing that entered our mouths at dinner. It's such a cool fish - watermelon, pomegranate seeds, toasted pumpkin seeds, olive oil and a total flavor overload. Not to mention the fact that the fish came out looking like sashimi grade tuna. So cool. Arroz Mamposteado - this was a cool fish. It was rice and beans, but mixed with avocado creme and and pork belly and chips. Incredible. I'm not much of a dessert but holy smokes did we devour the suspiro. I'm quite positive I licked the jar towards the end of the evening - don't judge me. I wish I could remember what cocktail I had, but the choices are all so unique and fun, I should have tried them all. Eh, gives me a reason to go back, right?!",
      "Thank you so much for the kind words and the detailed review of all of our dishes, Shannon.  It was a pleasure hosting you, and we look forward to your next visit!",
      "Obsessed is an understatement.Found this place on Yelp (I love you Yelp!) and with the rating and images I knew I was SOLD. The show stopping, craft cocktails is what I came for and I wasn't sure what to expect once we came. Was it a hype? Would I be disappointed? Who cares! You're in Miami and going to a Spanglish cocktail bar. We didn't make reservations but we did read it wasn't too hard to get in. And it was exactly just that. Came here at around 9:30 pm on a Saturday night and we were seated to the side entrance table with couches right away. It wasn't a good option for dining but we literally only came here for the cocktails so it was perfect!The vibe check in this place was everything. There was a live dj tucked in to the side making sure the music was on point. And it was!On to the craft cocktails:I ordered the Pornstar Mejican@ and it was delicious wish the mezcal was more of the star of the show and to be honest, given that everyone else's cocktails were truthfully visually so pleasing wish the presentation for this one was as well but that's totally ok!!! I still loved my experience. My hubby ordered the Cafetera Old Fashioned and WOW. What a presentation and fun way to serve it with an actual cafetera. It was definitely a show stopper. The Caipirinha Frizá was delicious and very unique as well and the Paparazzi came served in a photo lens so that was pretty cool!We loved Spanglish, would be back in a heart beat. Overall great vibes for cocktails and pretty cool presentation that really makes this place stand out. Excited to try their food next time!",
      "This place gives my New York Vibes OD! It's definitely giving New York Speakeasy Vibes. You'll probably miss it if your not paying attention because the sign outside is only a neon bottle sign. Inside is intimate with the cutest decor, low key, playing all the classic jams. I love a place that sets a vibe with an good playlist! Okayyy! We came for drinks after dinner, so we didn't order food but they did have a menu. All the drinks we ordered were sooo freakin good, and were in creative instagram worthy cups. This is definitely going to be my new hideaway spot. Service was amazing! Will be coming back!",
      "Okay, here's the thing with this place, it's so freaking loud that you can barely hear the person next to you, it's impossible to have any sort of conversation with a large group of people. The food was okay and drinks were pretty good on the other hand, so I think this is a good place for dates, just not a large gathering.",

      "What an awesome chic place.  Amazing craft cocktail & gastro pub style tapas. For cocktails I had 2 absolutely amazing Vuela Paloma'sDobel Diamante Tequila / Yellow Bell Pepper / Lime / Grapefruit / Ginger / Cilantro Tincture / Savory Salt Rim& 1 out of this world Caipirinha FrizáLeblon Cachaca / Muddled Fresh Lime / Sugar Cane / Green Apple & Fresh Herbs GranitaFor food we shared the most amazing items listed below.

      "The entrance to Spanglish is so subtle that it's easy to miss! Once you enter, the ambiance is cozy, intimate, and welcoming. We came because of the happy hour -- their cocktails were $9 and some small dishes were marked down! We ordered a round of the caipirinhas first and sadly were a bit disappointed, it was way more tart than expected and just tasted like lemon juice. The Chilcano tasted similar with the overpowering citrus. The Spanglish mule was way better! For small plates, we ordered the octopus croquettes, Caribbean dumplings, and a side of yuca. The octopus croquettes were my favorite of the items we ordered -- crispy, served hot, and the octopus inside was tender. The Caribbean dumplings were a little mushy, and the yuca was a bit tough and the sauce it was served with tasted like Big Mac sauce which I am not a fan of. Everything came out pretty fast, though!",
      "Finally got to visit Spanglish and let's just say I fell in love! I came here for happy hour with a friend and honestly we were blown away by how delicious everything was. We ordered the Spanish Milk Bread, Timba Frita, Queso E' Craba , and Tuna Tostadas. My favorite dish we tried was the Timbra Frita. It was the perfect bite full of flavor. We also ordered cocktails. We both ordered the Paparazzi which honestly tasted amazing but the presentation was killer. It comes served in a camera lens. Overall this place is a vibe. The music was lit. They were playing bad bunny. The artwork is awesome. I definitely see myself coming back here.",
      "Location a bit hidden in plain sight, so be sure to stop and read signs. Small  and intimate setting with a great ambiance for drinks and light bites with friends. The food was ok nothing over the top or extraordinary. I did like my margarita with the seafood bites. Drinks here before a walk around in Wynwood is never a bad idea.",
      "This place has no sign in front. We drive up and down and finally found it. Outside looks like it was closed. Nothing indicating it was opened except for a sign out front that shows menu of the day. We walked it and surprisingly was like wow. This is a cute small cozy restaurant.  The booth I say were pretty close to one another.  The bar area has 6 stools. The food was excellent! Extremely flavorful and so good. The octopus appetizer was amazing. We ordered one of their popular dish and weren't disappointed.  I forgot to photo that dish because I was so hungry.  Everything we had was great including the drinks. We love craft drinks and for sure it was super crafty. The paparazzi drink was so cute. It came in a camera cup and tasted great.I would be definitely coming back here again soon and recommend everyone to try if you haven't been here.",
      "Came here to try a few drinks on a Friday night and it wasn't as busy as I expected. I was able to sit at the bar and watch the bartender make these really cool looking and tasty drinks! The paparazzi was my favorite. Something about the dill and passion fruit combination was something I didn't know I needed. The vuela paloma was just okay, I'm just not the biggest fan of grapefruit. And the cafetera old fashioned tasted like a REALLY strong Cuban coffee, which I really enjoyed. Although the drinks were great, the vibe was kinda ruined by these drunk idiots sitting next to us at the bar, yelling and screaming. But I would still come here again to enjoy a cool curated cocktail."

      "Seaspice was amazing. It's a fantastic restaurant with a great view right on the Miami River. If you don't right you can catch the live music as the sun sets, and the restaurant transforms to a lounge. Totally worth coming Parking is tricky, and if you're not paying attention you might miss it as you drive by. But it's a gem worth coming back to.",
      "Seaspice is known to Miami locals as a very high end resturant, frequented by celebrities.  I have no idea why.  The service is pretty awful.  The drink runners are horrible.  It takes about 30 minutes for just a drink to be brought out to you.  The food is mediocre.  It is definitely NOT worth the price, which is very expensive.  I am giving two stars because the view is amazing.  Seaspice is right on the water and has a gorgeous ambiance.  You can watch yachts drive by and some will even pull up and park.  The other star is for the tres leches.  This dessert was AMAZING, I would go back just to eat it again.  But otherwise, Seaspice is nothing special.  Save your money.",
      "A place that tries to be high end but fails to deliver.Service ? Mediocre Food ? Below parFirst thing when you check in is they tell you that you have a 2 hr max(tacky)",
      "I read this was one of the best patio dining AND a hot spot for celebrities in Miami, so I had to go check it out on our recent travels to this area...Initially I was worried about our luggage situation, as we had to carry our luggage to the restaurant since this was our last stop in Miami. However, they were very accommodating, and let us store some of our stuff in the closet, and we kept the big luggage with us, near our table.As expected, the patio scene was spectacular...city skyline and seaside views, with plenty of yachts passing by! The place indeed had that chic celebrity vibe...truly FAB! Loved the music overhead as well. Somehow, I expected some snobbiness...but not at all. Service was great!Then the food. OMFG...I've had some amazing foods lately, but this takes the cake. Even the complimentary bread was amazing (and unique)! My husband ordered this Wagyu Burger, and I chose this Ragu Pappardelle ( THE best Ragu Pappardelle I've ever had...EVER. ). Then this Pavola dessert...again, just beyond delish. Truly, this was foods for the celebrities.Honestly, I'm shocked at how low the rating is for this place. I assume that if the service isn't top notch, it would probably piss some folks off. The pricing was on the outlandish side...with even lunch entrees starting at around 40. There was even an appetizer item priced at around 70 bucks! Luckily, like I said, I felt that the foods and the service (and especially the spectacular ambiance) made up for it. There was this big yacht parked right near us, which somewhat blocked some of the views from the left. Still, we got our eyeful of seaside/yachtside views.In any case, this was a great way to end our trip in Miami.",
      "Went here with a group of girlfriends for brunch and everything was delicious, they were super accommodating as well.I had the froze , a cucumber and gin cocktail and 2 grey goose and sodas and all were fantastic.As a table we split the fresh fish and a couple sides and it was delicious. Also love the free bread It is definitely on the pricier side overall tbh but great for a fun \"fancy\" brunch",
      "Came here for Miami spice and although we spent more than we thought we would, we had a good time. Everything was delicious. The kale Caesar had pecans and Granny Smith apple slices, never had a Caesar like this but it was a nice change! The Shrimp Pesto Whole Wheat Spaghetti was my favorite, even though I'm not the biggest fan of pesto. The burger was good too just a little messy from the truffle aioli. The chocolate cremoso and tres leches was very good but I'd go with the cremoso for the cocoa nib crumble, yum! All in all, I think it's overpriced and I probably won't come here again because of that. The cheapest bottle of Chardonnay was $75 and most drinks were $20. I only came here for Miami spice and still spent almost $200.",
      "Given we still have Miami Spice going on until the end of the month we decided to try out the lunch menu @ Seaspice gorgeous location on the Miami River, sitting outdoor is really relaxing, so beautiful to watch the boats go by, really lovely To start we had the Comte' Cheese Soufflé, I have to admit this was a bit disappointing, it really did not have the texture of a real soufflé  but then............ the Shrimp Pesto Whole Wheat Spaghetti and the Pan-Seared Chilean Seabass were really good as dessert, both the Tres Leches and the Chocolate Cremoso were yummy Try it out before Miami Spice ends, you can check out the Miami Spice Menus on miamiandthebeaches.com@seaspicemia",
      "First time for me at Seaspice, it is located on the banks of the Miami River it is a gem that you should not miss. Sit outside in the courtyard enjoy your food and a drinks while watching the boats go by, just beautiful We had the Miami Spice lunch which has a very affordable fix price 3 course menu for $ 28, unfortunately this will end soon, nevertheless, I would defiantly go back again for sureRegarding the Miami Spice menu only one observation, they should have had more than one choice for the Entrees without the extra charge, right now you have 4 choices and 3 of these have extra charge on it, not really fair given that you are promoting the Spice menu, you should have at least two or three choices included in the price and one or two with the extra charge We had had Prince Edward Island Mussels, Grilled, the Grilled Faroe Island Salmon and the Profiteroles and Peaches and Cream. My favorite where the Mussels, the garlic pizza bread they brought for the table was absolutely delicious, the Salmon was good too. I had the Peaches for dessert and it was ok, not really my thing, my friend said the Profiteroles were great, next time I will not opt for the healthy dessert We enjoyed all with a good Albariño wine, our experience was made especially enjoyable by our waiter Fabrizio, he was really great ! Thank you Fabrizio @seaspicemia",
      "Bad first impression. Its not a nice feeling to feel like you have to beg to spend your money at a restaurant. Every year I look forward to Miami Spice. It's a great way to try out various restaurants and a unique spread of menu options. Seaspice was on my radar and happened to be one of the participating restaurants offering the Miami Spice menu. I contacted the restaurant in advance and made a reservation for 3:30p for a party of four. My mom who is from out of town was excited to join us for lunch. I advised the restaurant we were doing the Miami Spice menu. The restaurant made it clear that they charge $50pp for No Shows. At 3:15pm, we arrived for our reservation. The hostess Karin greeted us, and advised us that they were running behind on the reservations and because of this they will not be able to offer the Miami Spice menu. Only the a la-carte menu will be offered. This was a bit upsetting because we drove almost an hour to get there and the restaurant is refusing to offer the Miami Spice promotion. Our natural instinct was to just say forget it we will go somewhere else. I mean, at the end of the day who wants to beg to spend their money? It's absurd. If the restaurant is offering a promotional menu and because to no fault of our own they are running behind why should we be penalized?My Mom looked so bummed out. Because she was so excited to try this place. I decided to walk back in and ask for a Manager. The Manager took 20min to come out. When he finally did come over, he introduced himself as Collin. I explained to him what was going on and it seemed as though he wasn't aware that the hostesses were turning Miami Spice customers away. He decided to make it right and advised Karin to honor the Miami Spice menu. Impressive! Things were turning around. Besides the encounter at the hostess stand, the restaurant is beautiful. It is situated on Miami's waterfront were you can view the million dollar yachts passing by. They also have docks for those interested in docking and dining. You can view the downtown city skyline which I am sure looks amazing at night.The food was excellent. The Miami Spice menu offered a three course lunch for $28. You have the choice of a starter (Kale Salad, Cheese Souffle, or White Gazpacho). A choice of entrees (Seabass, Chicken Breast, Shrimp Pesto Pasta, Wagyu Burger, or Plant Bowl). And a choice of dessert (Tres Leches or Chocolate Cremoso). They also offer the option to add a Glass of wine for and additional $12. I ordered the Comte Cheese Souffle, the Green Circle Farms Chicken Breast, and the Tres Leches. The others in my party ordered the Kale Salad, Gazpacho, and Seabass. For starters, My favorites were the Kale Caesar Salad and Cheese Souffle. The Kale Caesar had a mix of shredded Granny Smith apples, pecans and a creamy Caesar dressing. The cheese Souffle was like a fluffy egg Souffle with a cream parmesan sauce and tomato chutney. Delicious!For entrees, both the Seabass and Chicken breast were amazing. The Chicken breast was tender and juicy, served on top of a creamy polenta and topped with corn, peas, and mushrooms. The seabass was seared nicely to give a nice crunch on the outside, while perfectly flaky and moist on the inside. It was served with stewed garbanzo, Swiss chard, and smoked potato. For desserts, we all had Tres Leches. It was served in a small Mason jar topped with 3 milks, and berries. Perfect way to end the meal. The portions are not large but it is filling. The flavors are fresh and very well balanced. The food presentation was notable. The Watermelon Tequila drink was delightful and refreshing. The froze was also a big hit. The cocktails were presented well and created perfectly. We enjoyed everything. Our waiter, Austin was very friendly. He made great recommendations and was very attentive.An 18% gratuity was added to the tab. There are lots of street parking accessible. In the end, the food was great. Ambience was amazing. The hostesses can use additional customer service training and learn to use better judgment to improve the customers experience. There was no need to escalate the matters to a manager. It could have been handled properly by showing empathy, apologizing, and finding a solution to the problem.",
      "Hi Kim,Thank you for dining with us and leaving a detailed review. It has been forwarded to our management team. Our apologies for the confusion at the door.  Glad to hear Collin accommodated you and your experience was turned around.  We are happy to see your great feedback regarding the food, cocktails, and Austin’s Service.  Hopefully you will join us again in the near future!",
      "This is my second time going to sea spice & I normally love it as the first time. I never leave bad reviews But this second time MY PHONE WAS STOLEN AND SECURITIES DID NOThing about it. Instead we're trying to blame me for the situation. I'm not drunk nor was drunk. I walked in with 2 phone and walked out with 1.We came as my friend USUALLY does and this is how they treated us  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME. I thought it was 5 star so nothing could go wrong. With a security right next to our table my phone STILLL got stolen. It was on the table. And to whoever has the time to steal phones is just sad imagine what else they can steal... I wil ask to review cameras but with the way I was treated when I let them know I lost my phone I doubt they will be helpful but I'll let every platform form of review know that they steal phones here. I know the exact time frame as well so they wouldn't even have to look much at the cameras. Let's see. BTW I BEEN HOME SICK AFTER EATING THESE OYSTERS I COULDNT Even celebrate my baby's birthday w him.",
      "Came here for my birthday dinner with my boyfriend for a 7:15 reservation (we called in advance for an outdoor seat dock side) we waited about ten minutes after our arrival for our table to be ready at the bar, the short wait was definitely worth it. Started with an aperol spritz at the bar then ordered octopus and gazpacho to start. Octopus portion was good but the olive oil tasted burnt since it came out on a sizzling hot cast iron looking skillet (its very easy to overcook octopus, please just bring a regular plate next time.) I also had the whole main lobster. Extremely delicious large portion of perfectly cooked and seasoned lobster, bravo. My boyfriend had the truffle coated Chilean sea bass and he absolutely loved it. Vibe: 5/5 this place definitely is a scene but not overwhelmingly pretentious or obnoxious. Absolutely loved the music as well. Service:3/5 A bit slow, our server was very attentive when we were able to get his attention but we had to always wave him down. Food: 4/5 everything was honestly pretty good (octopus could've had a bit more attention to detail)",
      "Hi Liz,Thank you for celebrating your birthday with us!  We are so happy to hear you had a great experience and enjoyed the food.  Your feedback regarding the octopus has been sent to our chef. We look forward to seeing you again soon!"

      "Amazing steakhouse Our favorite was the the Australian Wagyu which I can only say was perfection. their sides were so perfectly complimentary. Truffle Mac and cheese, the Brussels sprouts, spinach, broccolini and cauliflower were excellent. Beef lettuce wraps were decent, beet salad was good, kids meals were devoured. ALSO if you're here for breakfast their buffet is great",
      "WOW - To say I was completely blown away by my first time dining here would be an understatement. Whether you're celebrating a special occasion or just craving a delectable meal that will leave you speechless, this is the spot that will be sure to leave a lasting impression. From the lavish and trendy decor, the out of this world dishes, beautiful presentations and impeccable service, every detail was taken well into consideration and perfected.I can say with certainty that this is one of the most gorgeous spaces I've ever eaten a meal in. The sultry vibe, elegantly designed interior, endless display of wine bottles scattered throughout the restaurant and the stunning bar will have you feeling like you're in the midst of dining amongst celebrities. There didn't seem to be a bad table to dine at in sight, but my parents and I were lucky enough to snag one of the beautiful half-moon booths toward the center of the room. When is the last time you've been to a restaurant that brings complimentary French fries to the table? And not just any regular ole' French fries, but a delicious trio of French fries each complimented by their own unique dipping sauce? Bet it's probably never happened before, unless you've eaten here. I thought this was such a neat but simple touch that really set them apart from other high-end restaurants. They also bring yummy rolls topped with sea salt to the table (between the fries & the bread, you might end up in a food coma before you even order if you're not careful). I ordered the tuna tartar for an appetizer and I was in heaven every time I took a bite. Not only does it melt in your mouth, but the presentation alone is enough reason to order this (the way they mix it for you makes for a fun video opportunity if you have your phone ready to record). My parents shared a shrimp cocktail that they both enjoyed - The shrimp were massive! Following the appetizers, I munched on a cesar salad which was perfectly dressed. Now... the STEAK. Holy moly, one of the best filet mignons I have had yet. It was ridiculously flavorful, tender & juicy. Melted in your mouth and bursted with flavor. If you're a steak lover, it would be a crime to come here and not order it. The mashed potatoes that accompanied it were also flavorful, but I thought they were a little too runny (my only complaint of the whole meal). If you're a fan of grilled onions, do yourself a favor and order a side of these to top your steak with and thank me later. The \"Smoked Chocolate S'mores\" dessert was ridiculously decadent and was the perfect finish to an impeccable meal. Yes, it's insanely pricy and yes, it's totally worth it. My experience here was one of the best dining experiences I've ever had in Miami - And that says a lot given the fact that Miami is one of the hottest spots in the country for foodies. This restaurant hit it out the park for me and I'm already searching for an excuse to go back to South Florida and to savor new dishes on their menu.",
      "The restaurant is spacious and nice. Bar is nice as well.Staff was friendly and attentive.For appetizers the tuna tartare was fresh and seasoned well.They also bring you French fries 3 different ways with 3 different sauces. I had the certified Angus rib cap cooked medium rare and It was good and flavorful. The side of Mac and Cheese was good as well.",
      "Our favorite was the the Australian Wagyu which I can only say was perfection.",
      "Ambiance was awesome. The dishes, coctails and the dessert were so delicious. All the employees were so polite and friendly. They celebrated our honeymoon with a cute card, it was so nice.They made our special day unforgettable.",
      "Wonderful experience! Fabulous service. Timing, everything was a 10.  Our server really made our night fabulous, she was awesome. Great steak, Mac and cheese with truffle was really nice. Molten cake was super good as well. I must say everything was impeccable.",
      "Phenomenal cuisine. Never have a enjoyed such a succulent and flavourful sea bass - it is one of their renowned specials. But the lack of bones in the fish was made up for by the pained bones in my rear.The decor was beautiful but very far from comfortable. The low chairs were too uncomfortable for eating. The benches; built for slaves.The overall experience was truly hampered by a god awful designer deserving of life in prison for her domestic terror on comfort. 4/5 not bad",
      "This plus is amazing! We had a private room & our server was Erin. Erin was very pleasant, patient, informative & very professional. She suggested several appetizers & dinner. It was our first time visiting this restaurant & it definitely won't be our last.",
      "Food was incredible. I love that when you get to the table instead of getting some bread you get french fries. Service was also impeccable and ambiance is very family friendly in my opinion"

      "While ending business day in Brickell Ave it's obvious that the usual rush hour traffic will be horrible, so rather than sit in traffic for well over an hour started to look for a place to have an early dinner. Quick search in Google and I found new location for TASTE 107 Restaurant in Brickell that must have opened recently. Upon first arrival noticed they had there own unique Asian decoration with beautiful Japanese music in background, place was very clean and staff super friendly. Food was amazing! I noticed one of the front window plates had been broken and covered with plywood. Although that area has been cleaned up a bit it's still a reminder that there is still a presence of homeless people.The service provided by the staff was phenomenal as usual from this franchise. We ordered new alcohol drink mango tango and fancy lady (made with real lycee) was unique and very good as the young male waiter was attentive, courteous, and truly made the experience memorable with his hospitality. Food was served quickly, warm and delicious. Desserts were new and something you should leave room to enjoy. As with all our  other visit to Taste 107 it was great dining experience and will be coming back again.",

      "I have went 107 Taste in different locations and this one is where I went most recently. They do update menu sometime so my latest favorites are this black pepper beef and spicy Mayo shrimp. I ordered double beef without zucchini - call me a picky eater but I personally prefer zucchini to be somewhere else like the sweet sour chicken. Black pepper, green pepper, onions, a little bit carrots plus the beef are the best mixture here. If the plan is only about some snacks, then this spicy Mayo shrimp is a must order. The name might sound plain but the taste is actually surprisingly rich. During the time I came in mostly John and Wenjie are my servers. They introduced the two dishes to me at the beginning which is absolutely a success. Service is always nice - they get everything you might ask for. :) Just swing by and give it a try.",

Takoyaki were perfect - crispy outside, soft almost gooey mochi goodness inside with generous octopus.  A must orderPad Soon Wa has excellent flavor. My only comment is that the noodles cook down to rice length and would best is eaten with a spoon. The cheesy noodle on fire is delicious, if you're a cheese lover. Imagine something like that Spicy Chicken Carbonara flavor instant ramen, but homemade with very distinct flavor! Yummy and cheesy.",

      "Decent ramen on the fringes of Brickell. Wouldn't say it's great nor would I say it sucks - it just kinda is.Biggest bone to pick is that there isn't a single vegetarian ramen. I feel like this is fairly standard practice at yuppie ramen places, but here all broths contain pork.Begrudgingly ordered an otherwise veggie ramen with tonkatsu broth. Since I don't get to eat meat often, it's normally a treat when I do. But this was whatever. Taste was fine but not really anything to write home about.Service was fine and it's a nice location just outside the craziness of Brickell. I would still probably look elsewhere though  given food situation.",

      "We had a good meal. A bit bummed. We do not eat pork and all there soups had pork in it. That was very disappointing. What we did get was good but I really wanted the soap.",
      "We ordered three bowls of ramen and fried chicken from this restaurant. The fried chicken is good but the ramen is average. Not as good as the 4-5 stars reviews mentioned. The soup base is average and doesn't have the umami taste. The noodles is average. Been to many States and cities ramen restaurants, I can't give this restaurant more than 3 stars. A good ramen will make you want to have another bite when there is no more noodles; and / or you consume the soup to the last drop. This restaurant will not give either of the experience.Try once is good enough.Best",

      "Love that this place finally opened up within walking distance! Between my husband and I, we've probably tried just about everything on the menu over the last few months. My favorites? The spring rolls, the Japanese donburi, and the mango ice tea (with added tapioca). They are always extremely fast, attentive without being overbearing, and delicious. Overall, it's a consistent, casual option in the often excessive Brickell neighborhood!",

      "Food was delicious. Requested sauce on side with two orders of gyros. Opened the bag, found no sauce and was bummed because that's what completes a gyro.",
      "James, than you for your comment and review.  I'm sorry about the sauces that you requested on the side.  I looked up the order and saw your request and i'm very sorry and disappointed in my team.  I apologize (too late to do something now) but i'll go back into Uber Eats and put a credit for your order. I promise next time we'll get it right!Alex",
      "Stumbled on this place in downtown Miami - absolute gem. Food was fantastic, portions were good and not too expensive like Miami often is.Service was exceptional/super friendly and the restaurant itself was very pretty inside and out.",
      "Hi Daniel,  Thank you for the kind words and review, we're happy to see that you enjoyed Meraki and your meal here...",
      "Overall this was a good experience. The ambience of the courtyard was probably the best part and feels like a private patio. The staff was attentive and polite. The service was really good. The food was just so-so. The flavors were good but the execution was what lead to a 3 vs. a 4. Grilled Octopus- the grilled octopus had a great char. I liked the pairing with the chick peas but thought it was over cooked a bit. Greek Salad with Lamb Gyro- the salad was the traditional Greek style with chunks of tomatoes peppers and onions. We had two Greek salads and both were loaded with tomatoes and were light on the other toppings. So it felt more like a tomato salad with feta than a Greek salad. The lamb gyro was good in flavor but again a bit over cooked. I would go back to give this place another try. I'd probably stick to the souvlaki platters as they seemed like the popular house choice.",
      "Good evening Amol,thank you very much for your review and kind comments.  Glad to hear that you enjoyed your dinner at Meraki and the service was up to par.  We'll pass on the comments about the food to the kitchen and find ways to improve.  We appreciate your business and looking forward to having you back soon.Kind Regards,Alexander Karavias",
      "As I walked down the alley I was instantly transported to the streets of Greece. I loved the white and blue colors accented with some plants. The food here tastes really authentic and the wine list is quite expansive. We had the greek salad, chicken skewers, and lamb gyro. The fries are super addicting, too. I wish I came with a bigger group so I could order more next time!Knocking a star off due to service. We had two different waiters that were not communicating with each other and kept asking our table the same questions. Definitely will come back!!",
      "Hello Manish,thank you very much for your review and kind comments.  We'll definitely have more fries for you working next time you come in and if anything, we'll share with you!As far as service and communication, we'll definitely work on improving that and perfecting it for that 5th star.  We appreciate your business, see you again soon!Alex",
      "The fact that this restaurant was tucked away in an alley in downtown gave you the opportunity to feel as if you were transported to Europe. The string of lights across the dining tables, along with the white rooftops and blue awnings gave it a romantic, european vibe- althought the metromover brought you back to Disney  but thats besides the point.The service was nice, the food came out fast at noon on a Wednesday, and overall the food was good. The salmon platter was fantastic and came with a good assortment of sides including spanakorizo, grilled eggplant, pita, and tzatziki. The \"tigania\" with seafood for 2 was a bit underwhelming. The size and variety was perfect, but the \"lightly breaded and fried\" dish was regularly bread and very fried- most of the items tasted overcooked. The hummus appetizer was also not the best choice. The hummus tasted more like vinegar than chickpeas. The pitas were tasty, soft, and warmIG: @miamicheatdays for more recommendations",
      "Thank you very much Veronica for the review.  Sorry about the hummus, I did taste it on that same day and you are correct, it had a bit too much lemon which caused it to be more acidic than it should be.  We'll definitely share your comments with our team and review for improvement.We appreciate your business,Alex Karavias",
      "To be completely honest--I have no idea how this restaurant has the rating it has. My friends and I stumbled upon this restaurant and saw it had good ratings so we decided to dine in. Maybe we went on an off day, but none of us enjoyed the food. The most off-putting thing that we all felt was that our server was very pushy trying to sell us on the most expensive dishes. It was not subtle at all, actually quite frustrating and uncomfortable for all of us. I won't go into details on that.We started w/ the octopus which was supposedly the best thing on the menu that everyone comes here for. Was overcooked & not fresh. I liked the chickpeas in the dish more than the octopus itself.The meats in all of our dishes were definitely not fresh. At All. I was a little suspicious when everything came out so fast, but I was right. The meat was not even heated (reheated) up all the way. Everything was so tough and hard to chew. Not to be dramatic but my jaw was a little sore from all the work it was doing. The 2 things we enjoyed--the arugula salad & the fries. I will say that the presentation of the food is very visually appealing. Other than that, not much to say.",
      "Thank you very much for your review Jeanie.  Sorry that our tastes did not impress and we'll definitely address the issue if our server made you feel uncomfortable.  Just for the record, the food came out quickly because it was a slow night (Tropical Storm), our kitchen was fully staffed and not as busy as usual.Kind Regards,Alex Karavias",
      "Came back  again on our trip & brought 7 more friends with us. We had a wonderful experience & all the food & service was great as usual. Seriously wish we had a place like this in MPLS. Haven't found one yet.",
      "Second yr jn a row going here on our Miami trip. Everything is amazing. Staff is authentic & decent. Fast, efficient & knowledgeable. I have a gluten allergy & they walked me through option based on my preferences. Dolmades are so good. We have had, salmon platter, different kabobs & skewers, salads & plates. Everything has been tasty & satisfying. Can be hard to find if don't know where to look. It is down a well lite/clean alley way & almost through another restaurant. Cool quirky place well worth going.",
      "I got denied service by the workers of this place because of my service dog. They said they don't allow dogs I told them my dog is a service dog and even showed the documents and Alex the server said I can't come in. Then I spoke to this lady in the photo that also works there and asked to speak to the manager and she mocked me and said nobody is manager and I can't talk to anybody about it. It's so sad that there's workers of a restaurant that do that to disabled people. Can't believe they're allowed to work there.Meanwhile Motek has great customer service and accommodated me and my service dog even brought water for my dog.",
      "Dear Kess, you were not denied service by the workers at Meraki, that is a complete lie as the rest of your review.  We told you kindly that we do not allow dogs inside, we offered to seat you at any of our patio tables, all of which have shade under umbrellas and we have fans provided.  The server's name was not Alex, my name is Alex and I am one of the owners.  Nobody mocked you and nobody said you could not speak to a manager, what they did tell you is that we do not allow dogs inside as per health department regulations.  Our workers never denied service to anyone disabled, the fact that you would even say that shows a level of ignorance consistent with this review.  We also provide water for our guests and our dogs, we're no different.Motek is great, they are great neighbors of ours and I'm glad you were able to enjoy your meal there, and if they allow dogs to sit inside along with guests we're fine with that.Kind Regards,Alex Karavias",
      "Filling, fun experience in the Grove. The host was pleasantly accommodating despite a busy holiday night. We waited only 15 mins for a table. The server was prompt and courteous. We had the Saganaki as an appetizer and it was so good one of our teens wanted one as her entree. Our daughter had the chicken souvlaki plate. It was much more food than expected and it was delicious. I had the moussaka and a side of Greek fries. The moussaka was addictive. The meat was seasoned well and all the flavors melded together for an exceptional dish. My husband had the filet kabob. The meat pieces were larger than anticipated and cooked medium rare as ordered. Again, the portion sizes were large. We would strongly recommend Meraki for a pleasant, satisfying meal.",
      "Thank you very much for joining us for dinner Tanya.  And most of all for being so understanding during this busy season!  We are so glad to see that you liked all the food and pleased with the service.  Hope to see you guys again when back in town.  We appreciate the kind words - Happy New Year!Alex Karavias",
      "I love this hidden gem ! It takes me back to Santorini Greece ! The food is always so fresh with great portion sizes ! Always quality!",

      "Looking for a place with good music, ambiance, drinks and food? You may be looking for Baby Jane. On a recent visit I noshed on the Brussel sprouts, dumplings and Tonkotsu Ramen.  My two apps were far better than my Ramen.  Both apps were savory, adequately spiced and good. The ramen was lukewarm. I unenthusiastically ate a portion. The broth was bland and they did not have chili oil or siracha. :(  Though it was just ok, it didn't warrant a \"send back\".The star of my evening was the awesome vibes, dj and Lavender Fields Forever. Mixed with Tito's Cocchi Rosa, Lavender Cordial, Lemon and Sparkling wine; it was definitely a great sip. I'd definitely visit again to give their food another try.",
      "To start off I used to LOVE baby jane. I would tell multiple people that their Ramen was amazing and had been there multiple times. My boyfriend and I had gone multiple times, and the previous time he tipped $100 on a 120 bill because the bartender was amazing.Then my boyfriend and I were there probably 6 months ago, I honestly thought I left a review already. Our server added auto grat and then we asked why, and he said to my boyfriend \"you don't look you would tip\" I'm sorry but that is blatantly disrespectful and honestly racist, and I cannot believe this happened in 2022.",
      "Love this spot!  Great vibes and excellent service!  The Shiro ramen with the fried chicken is delicious.",
      "Great ambiance, food is pretty good, slow-ish service. I LOVED the ambiance of this place. It had such cute signs and decorations. It also just seemed fun to be there. For food, I really liked the chicken yakitori, it was my favorite out of the dishes we tried. I didn't really care for the dumplings, the fried rice was alright, and the chicken bao was also pretty good. Service was a little slow but we were having a good time so it didn't really bother us. Will be back!",
      "Stopped here really quickly with my girlfriend to order food to go. The vibe inside was very chill, there was music and dim lighting. Overall ambiance was fire. I ordered the Shiro Kombu and the Rock Shrimp Tempura. The food was delicious, it came quickly and I had a few bites before leaving! We sat at the bar, the service was top notch, the moment I sat down to order I was immediately greeted and had a cup of water placed next to me. I would definitely come back and actually eat inside!",
      "Very nice bar in downtown Miami; great music and great atmosphere! They also had amazing bao buns! Would definitely come back and visit! Nice spot for bar hopping or just chilling / hangin out",
      "I second all the positive reviews of Juan the super waiter.We dined here on consecutive nights, sitting on the patio.  First night we had the rock shrimp tempura appetizer, which did not impress, and two varieties of bao, which were better.  Especially the pork bao.  Ginger carrot salad big enough to share.Second night the salad lacked dressing but the dumplings were very good.  Wife loved the fried chicken ramen bowl but I found the chashu ramen underwhelming.  Noodles good, broth not great and not enhanced by fatty chashu as it should be.  Chashu grilled but not fatty enough.Service is great.  Vibe on the patio just right.  Too noisy inside for me though.  Parking in garage across the street.Prices modest so I rate this an excellent value for the overall experience.  But for a ramen place they need to do better to get five stars from me.  I can get much better ramen in Texas, which is sad when you think of it.",
      "Baby Jane is nestled at the edge of the Brickell area just before you cross over the bridge to downtown.  I like the location because it is a little ways away from the heart of all the hubbub in Mary Brickell Village and Brickell City Center.  Actually, I believe Baby Jane is located in the spot what was if I remember correctly, a sports bar.  Baby Jane is definitely a step up.  I was very impressed with the food and overall presentation.  Also impressive, the cocktails.  My wife enjoyed one of the signature cocktails, the Bebito.  She thoroughly enjoyed it.  It was smooth, tasty and had a little bit of fruitiness.  I was not very interested in the signature cocktail menu.  To be honest, I am tequila or cucumber and well, the drinks had at least one of those ingredients.  But, they have a full bar so I asked for a Bullet old fashioned.  It did not disappoint.  Actually, it's quite impressive when you order something that isn't on the menu and a place is not only able to make it but make it well.  We started off with the dumplings.   I love pork and these did not disappoint.  The flavor was absolutely wonderful.  And there was just enough heat that it doesn't overtake your tastebuds allowing you to taste the meat inside.  Actually, I was taken aback at first as I felt the ting in my mouth initially but it worked very well with the dish.  We then shared the Shiro Shoyu and the Pork Buns.  I am glad we did.  The serving was more than enough to feed two people.  The food was absolutely divine.  My wife commented on the fried chicken in Shiro Shoyu, that it was still a little crunchy and not soggy.  She especially liked that.  The buns were wonderfully flavored.  They too had a little bit of spice but the coolness of the  carrots and cabbage on top took away from some of the sting and it was a lovely complement.So, if you have gotten to this point of my review, you probably assume that I had a wonderful time.  And I did!  But why 4 stars and not 5?  Well, let me tell you.Service.  When we arrived we were told we could sit anywhere and we asked if we could sit outside.  The answer was yes; so, we opted to sit outside and mind you we weren't the only ones.  We seemed to be forgotten.  I think we sat out there a good 10 minutes before I decided to inside to ask if there was outside service.  I could see the bartender was not happy as someone dropped the ball.  We were attended to shortly.  And as the night went on, the service improved.  I would give Baby Jane 4 1/2 stars but that isn't an option here on Yelp; so, 4  stars it is. There is a little room for improvement.  Otherwise we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and will definitely return.",
      "What a fun bar find steps away from our AirBnb! Stopped by for a quick snack and drinks... the drink menu is what i DREAM of. And Juan (the gentleman that took care of us) deserves a raise and praise for his excellent service, warm + friendly attitude, and for going above and beyond with our table. Thank you, Juan! You remind me of what I loved most about being a server; the chance to really make someones day.There are plenty of spicy drink options if you love them like I do and the food menu is just as impressive.White fish ceviche is a MUST if you like seafood and/or ceviche. Sooooo flavorful and unique. Reminded me of a Qdoba burrito (somehow) in the best way, cause I love Qdoba! My bf is a Brussels Sprouts fiend and said these were incredible, as was his carrot+ginger salad.We just came for a few drinks  (Bebito & that passionfruit margarita are KILLER) and apps but left so happy and ready to come back next time we're in Miami. What a lovely, quirky, totally unique vibe and decor + all of the staff are so welcoming and friendly. Much love to Baby Jane!",
      "Ramen and drinks? Count me in!Small little joint located near busy Brickell and 5th so parking at a garage is a must if traveling via car. Nicely decorated with music pumping through the speakers definitely set the tone for Saturday night. Not too packed at 7pm so we were able to get our pick for a table for two. We sat inside to get the full experience and watch the establishment go to work. QR code for the menu we ordered the Spicy Passionfruit Margarita and \"Back in your Baby's arms\" (bourbon) for cocktails. As far as the drinks, they were SUPER loaded with ice, not enough punch so tasted a bit watered down. Disappointed since each drink is in the teens$. Didn't complain since we weren't really here for the drinks, but for you drinkers the bar lacks a bit. The food is where it's at. My wife ordered pork and rice based (Chashu Bowl), the pork bites were delicious! Very filling and tasty. But my dish took the prize - Shiro Shoyu. Fried Chicken, yummy broth, thin noodles, marinated egg...oh my mouth waters as a write. So glad we didn't share our dishes. Good sized portion, awesome enough to get you going for a Saturday night if you're going to be out and about. Service is friendly and prices are decent. Good stuff!"

      "I LOVE Moxies!!!  This is a great, fair priced spot in Brickell.  You can come dressed casually or dressed up.  There are plenty of TVs to watch games, but I definitely wouldn't consider it a sports bar.  The interior is chic and the servers are dressed up nicely. The food is AMAZING.  I've had so many things on the menu and they are all delicious.  You cannot beat the prices for the quality of food!!!  The only thing that I've had that I wouldn't order again was the Tuna Sushi Stack and the Sushi Cones.  Neither were bad, but there are just so many things on the menu that are significantly better.  Generally, the service is very good.  There have been a few occasions where the service is slow, but that is not typical.  The tip is not included, which is unusual for Miami.  On Wednesday they have 1/2 off bottles of wine, but be sure to make a reservation ahead of time!  This place is always packed.",

      "Brunch? Always. Brunch at Moxies? A delightful surprise! I went by when my first brunch choice fell through, and it turned out to be a better pick!Huevos Rancheros were chock full of filling ground black beans and cheese swimming in delightful enchilada sauce. Scooping up the runny sunny side up eggs with tortilla chips seals the deal!Every french toast should be like the Brioche Bites. Crispy on the outside, warm, soft, spongy, rich vanilla flavor on the inside. House made caramel dipping sauce makes me melt for it all!I took a gander outside of my drink tastes with a Royal Paloma and you should too. The use of sparkling grapefruit soda instead of juice is the winner here!Our server was prompt and checked on us enough that we never felt like we were missing anything. My napkin fearlessly blew under our table (the price of sitting outside and enjoying nice weather), and she got me another set of silverware wrapped in a napkin as soon as we asked for a new one.One cool aspect of their menu is that they feature a section for vegetarian and plant based offerings and denote their vegetarian dishes with a V symbol, so it's easy to stick to dietary whims if you're looking for it. We're not talking silly salads either. I'm going back for the crispy tofu and wonton strip lettuce wraps and miso ramen!They have several TV screens around the restaurant and the bar so you can catch your teams play too. I got to watch the World Cup while getting my brunch game on! It's definitely worth a stop by in all the options in Brickell.",

      "Loved this place.  We waited 40 min for the outdoor seating.   We had an espresso martini at the bar while we waited and ended up chatting with some other bar guest.  Before you knew it it was time for our outdoor table. We had French dip with fries $19.  And kale salad with grilled salmon $26 plus a cucumber cobbler and another espresso martini.  Everything was very good.  Can't believe the size of the French dip for the price.   The outdoor seating was nice - great people watching and enjoying the vibe of brickell.

Finished off with the sticky toffee cake and coffee. Beware, no hot milk for a capuchino only espresso or American coffee. The toffee cake is more like a banana bread than a sticky bun. The guac was delicious and so were the steak bites. Our waitress was very flirty with my date and seemed new - didn't know if she could bring a soda with the meal. One thing I did notice is there are several managers checking the floor and many extra staff bringing water and plates. The place is packed for hours. They're open late - left after 11pm.",

      "I have been coming to Greenstreet Cafe for years. It is a wonderful location and a perfect spot to go to at any time of the day. Their breakfast/brunch menu is my personal favorite! It gets very full during the weekend brunch so expect to wait a bit, but weekdays it is not as busy. I tried their Arnold Palmer Frosé and I'm so glad I did. It's the perfect balance of tea, lemonade, and vodka. So refreshing and is perfect for a warm day. I then ordered the Cinnamon Roll Pancakes. These have been my go-to for a while now! The pancakes + icing are a perfect combination.Lastly, our server JC was so amazing. Not only was he very attentive to our table and everyone he was serving, he was a pleasure to have conversation with. Thank you JC!!",
      "Came here for brunch while in the area-- I was in search of a tasty eggs Benedict.  The restaurant was busy and we sat outside. We were quickly seated after arriving. Lots of people were out to brunch in the sunny weather and we could watch passerby's and cars drive by. While we were waiting for our food our waitress brought us a complimentary cinnamon roll which was warm and soft and delicious and HUGE. The Nutella French toast was heavenly, and had so much Nutella oozing out of it--which was perfect for me and my mom as we both love Nutella. The eggs Benedict was also very good, I was so full from the cinnamon roll and sharing the French toast that I couldn't even eat the potatoes. The hollandaise sauce on the eggs Benedict had a nice slightly tangy, citrusy hint to it.Would totally come back.",
      "My all time favorite. I'm Coconut Grove born and raised. This restaurant is like a staple in the Grove. I love it here. I've met up with so many of my friends over the years at this restaurant. I always have a good time here. The food is great. Sitting outside is good for people watching. It's also shaded outside.I would highly recommend  coming here. The parking in this area is tight, but there have a few spaces for you to park. I think you still have to pay the attendant if he's still there. There is ample paid street parking. There is also a lot very close by for parking as well. Overall , I've always had a great experience. Food is a little pricey but costs have gone up for them, so of course menu items will go up too.",
      "Greenstreet Cafe is a brunch staple in the Coconut Grove area. After an unexpected cancelled reservation for another nearby restaurant --my friends and I decided to stop in to try their dinner options and we are so glad we did! We were seated right away on an sidewalk table which is perfect for people watching. The cocktails are delicious, I recommend a mojito or a Cool as a Cucumber Martini. Both very refreshing. The hummus was perfect, it was creamy and the pita came warm. Highly recommend. We also tried the smoke salmon dip which was equally enjoyable. For mains we tried the lobster ravioli, cheeseburger with fries and requested a special order of the mushroom sauce used for the ravioli plate to be added to pasta noodles and they gladly accommodated! Everyone enjoyed their meal and was very satisfied. The star of the show-- dessert! Ending the night with an Espresso Martini, Nutella French toast and slice of key lime pie. Leave space as this sweet coma was totally worth it. Highly recommend grabbing a few friends and enjoying a full filling dinner here! Attentive, quick service and a menu where everyone can find something they will love.",

Perfectly cooked asparagus is always a hitter!Will definitely be back to try and and the service was good here.",
      "Came here 3 times on a 6 day Miami trip. Must get Coconut Crusted French Toast, Cinnamon Roll Pancakes, and side of Potatoes.Coconut Crusted French Toast - 5/5. Coconut heavy, sweet, and incredible. Never had anything like this before and hope to again.Cinnamon Roll Pancakes - 5/5. Beautiful cinnamon roll swirl in the pancake itself reassures you this is taken seriously, not just a bit of cinnamon in the pancake mix. Potatoes - 5/5. Didn't expect much from a side of potatoes but they are crispy with an equal portion of blackened bits of onion. Holy Mezcal - 4.5/5. Well balanced, great spice levelRobbie's Lemonade - 4.5/5. Light, refreshing.Nutella French Toast - 4/5. Solid and nutella heavy.Caramelized Banana Pancakes - 4/5. The bananas are good but the ratio has too much pancake relative to banana.",
      "Came for breakfast around 8:30 am on Saturday.  The weather was beautiful so we sat outside.  I had a cafe con leche and the Nova Benedict.  My friend had a cappuccino and a feta spinach omelette.  The food was great and we were in and out in an hour.  We parked on the street.  It was easy and $1.50 for 2 hours.  Walked around the Grove afterwards.",
      "We sat outside the venue and really enjoyed the atmosphere with great music, beautiful lights and covering for all weather. Our waiter was very kind but service was very slow due to most of the chefs calling out sick. We waited about 1.25 hours for our food but the wait was worth it. The spinach dip was divine and melts in your mouth. The chicken linguini Alfredo was very rich and creamy. This was a great local spot not overrun by tourists. Definitely rec",
      "Came here for brunch on a quiet weekday morning and was quickly seated, no reservation, no wait time. Our waiter was very attentive. I had the cinnamon pancakes, some of the best pancakes I have ever had, they will live rent free in my head for a good while. My husband had the steak and eggs, which he loved. We look forward to coming back to explore their menu, lots of options available. The restaurant offers outdoor and indoor seating.",
      "Party of 3, Tuesday, January 3rd, 2023 9:42 AMParking on street and parking lots for a fee (no free or validated parking anywhere for this area or restaurant). Greeted and seated immediately, sat outdoors curbside (shaded with umbrellas), drink order taken as we sat and we ordered a cappuccino, iced hazelnut latte with sprinkled cinnamon. Placed food order and received it in about 10-20 mins. Everything was picture perfect, delicious and filling. We had scrambled eggs with ham/swiss cheese with plain bagel and potatoes, scrambled eggs with swiss cheese with everything bagel and potatoes, and two giant plain pancakes (pancakes look massive but it's a good portion as the 8 year old ate 95% of it). Service was on point and made the latte suggestion for me as I'm not a huge coffee drinker but was in need of some and I needed iced coffee not hot at the moment so the iced hazelnut latte was perfection and refreshing. Enjoyed our Tuesday morning breakfast in the New Year. We've been coming here, continue to come here and will always come here.",
      "Wednesday, February 9th, 2022Street parking and parking lots for a fee, immediate seating, drinks served within minutes, food also in a timely fashion, food always on point to perfection, excellent service. Zero complaints even on a cloudy raining day, it was perfect, we sat outdoors under the umbrella enjoying brunch and cappuccinos  two people, roughly $32-$35"

      "We came here on a Saturday night. Greeted by a very energetic host, who worked with us while we waited for the other half of our party to arrive. He got us a couple of glasses of wine which we found out later that he had comped. Very classy!Wine bottle prices are extremely reasonable, especially in Miami. The menu prices are not bad at all. But our waiter Alessandro definitely went out of his way to help us order items that we would enjoy. He was extremely attentive which if you live in Miami you know is a rarity. My husband and I have food allergies, plus we were there late at night when certain menu items can run out. Alessandro took care of us, crafting pasta dishes that we would enjoy. My husband had a pasta arriabata and I had seafood pasta. Alessandro had the kitchen tailor them to our needs. Were the dishes amazing? Not really. But that didn't matter, the service was perfect, and it makes me want to go back and try other dishes on their menu.They have a large patio, and a wonderful ambiance. Great for a romantic dinner or a fun meal with friends. We will be back!",
      "Obsessed with their mushroom pappardelle!! And on Mondays & Tuesdays, select pastas and pizzas are only $10! What a steal. Also a big fan of their vegan impossible pizza and carciofi salad - so refreshing.Overall it's a great neighborhood restaurant with friendly staff and the cutest outdoor dining area. There is a small free gravel parking lot on the side, too.",
      "Been wanting to try this cute neighborhood spot for awhile and it did not disappoint! I love that they had vegan options for pizza - the impossible pizza was delicious! Mushroom pappardelle had the perfect pasta texture. Service was super friendly and helpful. Will definitely be coming back to try out more dishes.",
      "*Monday & Tuesday $10 pizzas at dinner time*First time eating in person, the outside environment was lovely and really relaxing. We decided to try the Margarita pizza and Indiavolata. The Indiavolata Pizza was sooooo spicy I was dying for something besides water as it was so hot. The pizza was dripping in hot chili oil. Do Not recommend. The margarita pizza was just basic and had cheap cheese on it. Service was lacking as well, our water cups took awhile to get refilled and servers didnt check up on us till it was time for the bill. The gentleman at the restaurant who was probably the manger was really nice and was assisting with all the tables.Overall I would just go here for the star pizzas and probably just take out. Other then that not impressed.",

      "Love Coral House! Their service is top-notch. I've visited a handful of times during dinner and have had a great experience. The staff all greet you with familiarity and kindness. They're accommodating too. There was a time when it was raining out, and the team rearranged the tables outside so my boyfriend and I wouldn't get wet. The inside was full, so it was nice to have an outdoor space, although it needed some prearranging. The food is also delicious! Two for two. Their pizzas are perfect. The meatball appetizer was tasty, and the wines were excellent. I recently ordered the chicken Milanese, and it was phenomenal.  You can't ask for much more from a restaurant. Tip: come with time to look for parking. Although they have a small parking lot behind the restaurant, it's usually packed and a hassle to get out of. Take the time to look for parallel parking. A nice walk on Coral way is a bonus.",

The atmosphere is wonderful with light music playing which really allows you to enjoy the food and company. The food was all very tasty and filling. I ordered the Salmon Black Tagliolini (pictured) and I loved it. The pasta was not saucey which I actually prefer, and the salmon had great flavor. Service was also great, although it took the server a while to get to us and he didn't check up to make sure our food was alright, he still did a great job and was very friendly. Go ahead and check them out. Totally worth the visit.",
      "I was so excited to write this post that I am still chewing my last bite! This is my 5th visit (dine-in and delivery) and each time better than the last. Pasta is delicious but the pizza......they nail it! The slight crisp on the crust that turns into chewy goodness that makes your jaw hurt. The Romana pizza is basically puttanesca on dough. Robust flavors. The carciofi salad is refreshing compliment to the intense pizza. Pine nuts bring all of it together. Desserts solid. They ran out of coffee. Disappointing but they worked a small miracle and delivered the coffee. Great service. The outdoor space is lovely.",

I have been knowing this place for 2 months and I went here 3 times already.",

      "My boyfriend and I have been wanting to try this place forever! We went for dinner as walk-ins and it was very spacious and not too crowded which was nice. The atmosphere was nice and romantic. We ordered the provoleta cheese dish to start and that was delicious if you're big cheese people like us :). I ordered the wagyu flap meat steak and he ordered the angus wagyu cross NY strip. We both ordered it medium rare. Both came out very rare. Mine was still very tasty, but the strip was cold and undercooked. The waiter was very accommodating and brought us a steak that was closer to a medium rare. I would recommend ordering the skirt steak or flap meat steak, though. The meat itself has much more flavor!Finally, we ordered the arroz con leche nigiri for dessert which were super cute and tasty! Wine selection was good so naturally, we ordered a second bottle :D.",
      "Came to The Wagyu Bar to treat my youngest brother to a birthday dinner. We had the Wagyu Nigiri for an appetizer which was pretty good. We ordered the USDA Prime Certified Picanha which was a 48 Oz of pure deliciousness of a steak with 3 sides. Cooked perfectly medium rare, very tender, juicy and flavorful. It came with 3 sides in which we elected the Mac and Cheese, grilled Vegetables and fries. Everything was perfection and happy that I chose this place for dinner. They have outdoor seating, good ambiance/atmosphere being that it's in Coral Way and it's pet friendly since we had the goldendoodle with us. Service was awesome and they give Aqua Panna for water which is very good . Highly recommend this place for great delicious meats.",

The food, experience, and service by Jacob our server was OUTSTANDING!If you're looking for all the flavors to hit your palate, this place is the place! We started with Tuna Tataki and the Sausage Platter. AMAZING! For entrees, we got the 8oz filet, the NY Strip, and the Skirt Steak. For sides we had creamed spinach, the heirloom carrots, Mac 'n cheese, Brussel sprouts, and fries. All were off the charts.If you love lychees, I HIGHLY recommend the Sake Lychee. We will for sure be back.",
      "Total utter rip off. First of all this place \"casual\" steakhouse is in a random strip mall. The place is practically empty on a Saturday afternoon. The few diners are in flip flops and shorts! We are expecting top tier steak as we ordered the A5 wagyu cuts of steak. I have had A5 wagyu in many top steakhouses so I know the flavor profile and texture of the meat. What was served at the restaurant is NOT A5 wagyu quality meat. It's a chewy, flavorless piece of steak. The only thing that we enjoyed was the wagyu nigri. The sides are atrocious. Plus even thought they market themselves as \"casual\" and \"affordable\" putting emphasis on quality of steak, it would've been cheaper for me to eat at REAL wagyu steakhouses like Cote who actually are Michellin starred. SKIP this place, your wallet, time and stomach will greatly appreciate you.",

Cooked medium rare and seasoned perfectly. Served with creamed spinach and brussel sprouts. Totally delicious. I recommend coming in a group of 4-5 to have a chance to taste different items.",
      "Love this place!  Been here twice and its small but cozy and welcoming.  Food is yummy and staff has been great both times.",
      "We came here for dinner for 4 people. When we came in, there was no one there to greet us and no actual host in the front to check in. When we actually sat down, our server was very nice. Also, another guy told us about a special that can feed 4 of us to try different steaks. We opted for the 4 special steak, which includes the Japanese A5 waygu, Picanha steak, Denver Steak, and Ribeye Angus cross. All the steak was very good, but we all liked the Ribeye Angus Cross the most. The least favorite is the Denver since it was very chewy. The Japanese A5 waygu was delicious and very tender meat. Our only complaint is that when we got the meat, it was kind of cold, but not ice cold. It just feels like the meat has been sitting out for a while. It wasn't warm at all, and it may have to do with the wood plate it is served. We got salad, fries, and Brussel sprout as the sides. All the sides were delicious. Definitely get the salad! The salad dressing is delicious. We also got the strawberry cheesecake and the tres' leches. My brother and his gf got the strawberry cheesecake and they love it. We got the tres leches, and it was also good but just so much milk. Overall, they have a very nice selection on steaks. Just wish the steak was warm when served. We didn't say anything since we were so hungry that we just devoured it.",
      "I've been following this group for a while and finally got a chance to have dinner there this week! My partner is a huge fan of steak so he met me for dinner after work. While I waited I looked over the wine menu, of course! The owner and waiter were so nice that they offered me a taste of 2 types of the reds to decide which I liked more. They were both good, but I went with the better one, the Malbec! My partner went with the Inedit draft beer from Spain and he liked it a lot. Next we tried the Miyazaki-Gyu A5 Nigiri, which is 6 pieces of Japanese A5 Wagyu Miyazaki-Gyu Nigiri on sushi rice! Wow and it was torched table side!! That was so delicious, rich and the perfect bite. Then we decided on the Rib Eye Wagyu-Angus Cross with the Bacon Brussel Sprouts and Truffle Parm Fries. This steak was perfection, smooth like butter but not too rich. The sprouts had a bacon-y charred flavor and I could have had a huge bowl of them! And of course the fries were super hot & crunchy. We skipped dessert but maybe next time!"

      "I like the quality of flavor of this place. Prices a good. A little painful to get to with Flagler construction, but I can't knock them for that. It pains me to drop the stars here, but todays order had execution issues I didn't know how to report elsewhere. 1) pickup / deliver to car (first time trying it). Called the number it said with the check number. Only they provided the Ft. Lauderdale number not the miami one. No problem, looked up the miami number and called: no one picked up. So went inside and picked up the order. Luckily I was able to find a spot to quickly park. 2) they forgot to put ahi tuna on my poke bowl (double checked the receipt which also had ahi listed). Once again, I called and no one picked up. 3) in an effort to reach the restaurant one more time directly and not via Yelp, I checked their official order app - the only way I could see to leave feedback was by calling the same number no one picks up. Hence this bitter sweet yelp review. Everything else was perfect though. Highly recommend the bao buns, shrimp dumplings, and poke bowl. When they get it right, it's really a five star spot price/ quality considered. Inside is casual.",
      "Amazing quality, great price, surprisingly good finishings. I am super impressed at this place. They do not seem to cut corners, yet deliver an exceptionally tasty product. I think this may be family owned, which just adds extra icing to the package. Order;My Poke, My Way (custom made by me using fresh ingredients) 5-starSteamed Shrimp Dumplings (great filling and shell) 5-starPork Bao Bun (oops, only got one... next time that will likely be two) what you'd expect! Thankfully the bun was not dry or cakey as you might find in other places. Give them a shot, I don't think you'll be disappointed. Hope they are successful enough to expand their line into sushi rolls. Downtown is missing a quality, value sushi place. Keep up the great work!PS. I really appreciate the good quality ingredients here. Similar slots nearby leave my stomach feeling off. Not with this place. Hope they do not change the formula!",

      "a mixed experience.  the good:  yaki udon.  noodles were properly cooked, sauce was flavorful, and portion size was adequate.  had a touch of heat as advertised.  not as good, though certainly not bad, was the mapo tofu.  this dish eschewed the traditional pork in favor of chicken/shrimp/beef options.  portion size was fine and the serving of rice that came with was -- wisely -- generous.  the bad:  the red bean bao buns.  looked and tasted right out of a box.  filling was okay but the doughy exteriors were an utter fail.  would be an interesting addition to the menu but not like this.prices were reasonable for the just-north-of-brickell location.  service was friendly and efficient for a take out order.  so, on balance, worth a repeat visit to sample the rest of the menu.",

They have a good variety of bubble tea flavors and also options to customize sweetness, ice and toppings which can be hard to find in Miami! I made a custom poke bowl and the portion was huge! It easily could have been 2 meals. My friend had a bowl with tofu and enjoyed it as well. I will definitely be back to try other bubble tea flavors and some of their other dishes!",

The offer some more Americanized (less traditional) toppings such as broccoli and shredded carrots, but the typical masago, seaweed salad, etc. BOBA I used to be a boba snob but then moving to Miami taught me I can't anymore. Definitely the best boba I've had so far. The balls are soft and chewy, the tea flavor's strong and fragrant (I got 25% sweetness). SERVICE The people were nice! However, it was pretty slow to put together our bowl so I probably would order ahead for pick up if you're in a hurry. AMBIANCE casual place to catch up with a friend. They have a good amount of seating inside and outside.",
      "Delightfully Id like update my review for I have Been here a few times since my first experience at the Sovereign-Miami. What can I say ,,, the tuna/Salmon poke bowls are way to freshly delicious not to do so. I update my review. had to update reviewI've been here twice I've returned twice for the tuna/salmon bowls. If you're into Asian poke bowl and boba teas then I'm more than positive you will find satisfaction in sip and bite of it. I can clearly see that all Ingredients are always fresh. There's a pretty wide selection of items in the menu with description on the side. So if you're not into eating that raw kinda but not so raw fish, it's cool you can play it safe because they also serve noodles, plenty of fried options, soups, dumplings and things and more. So if you're reading this review wondering if you should check em out, the answe is YES! Sovereign is doing its thing.",
      "I can't say I totally enjoyed the meal Or Tea I chose for lunch that day. Obviously it was my first time visiting at Sovereign and I really had no idea what on what I'd have off of the menu, so asked if there any recommendations, I listens to a fewand I went with with something beef,,,,,, well it wasn't horrible but the meat had a pretty thick line of fat across every piece. Literally every piece. And that's not an exaggeration. I want to believe that that's the way that meat comes, but I wasn't a big fan of it as you can see. But definitely ate the veggies and drank a a few sips of the mango green tea. I felt it way too sweet and mangoishhhh. It was more the very sweet side than the refreshingness that I going for. But definitely theres a lot more items on the menu and I'd love to come by again and try something else. The atmosphere in there was great, super clean, nice vibes going. The service and presentation is awesome. Check em out."

First of all, i love that this historical place ( Miami Women's club) was re-born  in such a beautiful creation. From the vintage looking elevator, to balconies.. just feels like you went back in time!  We sat at the bar. Landon was an excellent bartender: great company and amazing service. We ordered seafood appetizer( the best oysters i've ever had!) and their signature margarita. Simply delicious!  Our experience was top notch! Can't wait to go back!",
      "Hi Jane!Thank you for your review! We'll make sure to shout out Landon.Please come visit again soon.-The Klaw Team",
      "I really wanted to give Klaw five stars. My husband took me there for my birthday and what an amazing place. It is beautiful, swanky, off the beaten path, and everything Miami. You exit the elevator into a beautiful dinning room.  We were there early and got a window seat with views out to Biscayne Bay. Our waitress Hailey was professional, well-trained, sweet, and delightful. All the servers were top-notch and on point. We had Cava and wine, which were both amazing. We had 3 appetizers which were great. I had the Nigerian prawn, which was something special. I have never seen a prawn that large and never tasted one that delicious. We ordered the grilled mushrooms and the grilled green beans. We rarely eat vegetables with such delight. Dessert was the flourless chocolate cake, another star. Not too much and not too sweet!Why 4 stars? My husband ordered the chicken which he had tried before and really Loved. But this time it was way too salty. Stephan the Manager did everything to help him order the right steak and his efforts were noted and appreciated. They really tried to make it right. He eventually ordered a steak and the truffle fries, which were Good, but just a little much by that point.We would definitely go back!",
      "I came across this restaurant when looking up new places in Miami. Here's what I got to say :) Venue: is easily accessible which was great. Valet parking available. $20 for regular. $60 to park up front. Also, the venue is absolutely gorgeous. The aesthetic was perfect. They did an excellent job with the decor. It's definitely a vibe. I love that the plates and napkins had the Klaw name on it. I love those kinds of details. Service: We had a good experience with service. We did feel on several occasions they were trying too hard to upsell and that drives me nuts. But our waitress was very nice and did check in very often which is nice. Food:Ok so obv there's a king crab and steak speciality at Klaw.For appetizer we had the king crab tacos. They were two micro sized tacos and expensive. TBH if the taste had been there I would not complain of the price. Truly they were not memorable. As for the meat selections. They have various cuts of meats from different ranches. These ranches feed their cattle in different ways to get the meat to taste a certain way. Initially the one we picked was not available. Our waitress was quick to suggest another selection except instead of picking one in the price range of the one we had selected she suggested one that was double the price. Ok. We got through that and picked something new. Note that these steaks are more to share because the smallest size is 25oz. Don't get me wrong. The steak was good. But it wasn't the best I ever had. It did come with two lovely sauces. One was a peppercorn sauce and another was a truffle based sauce. They were tasty. For the sides we had the steak cut fries. We did enjoy those. Also had the bok choy. It was ok. Nothing memorable either. Very plain taste. As far as the king crab. I am a big king crab fan and was really looking forward to it. However. The prices were truly exaggerated even for Miami standards. Just out of principle we decided to skip the king crab. I really hate when restaurants over charge things like that. It's tacky. I do know it's not an inexpensive food to eat and there is inflation lol but yeah no - and if it would have been mediocre I would have been really annoyed. Last but not least for dessert we had the tres leches. It had coffee liquor and crispy coconut on top. Must say it was very unique and tasty. Don't think we will be inclined to go back. It was decent. But not worth the $$$$",
      "Hello Ninette,Thank you for recently visiting Klaw and for your very detailed review. Apologies we didn't live up to your expectations and hope you give us another try soon. Regarding our King Crab, we'd like to point out we bring Live King Crab from Norway every other week. We take pride in the tanks we have built for them in our crab shack on site. We have created an optimal environment for them to live until they are served to our guests. Our Norwegian King Crab is live and never frozen unlike the frozen Alaskan King Crab you find everywhere else. Our King Crab is tender and sweet, it doesnt compare to anything else in the market. We hope you give it a try next time you are in, we promise, it won’t disappoint!-The Klaw Team",
      "Had a great first experience at Klaw. Visited for their happy hour and was impressed with the food and service. Ordered the oysters, beef carpaccio, beef rib tacos, and picanha, and I'd run all of it back because everything tasted great. Great deal and nice view. The raspberry, lemon, and egg white cocktail was delightfully tart, and they were able to make the HH margarita skinny and spicy. We'll be back with friends!",

      "I've been to Klaw for dinner three times in the past month or so (yes, three/it's THAT good), and I can't get enough! I love the bar area on the upper floor, the views are stunning and they have Happy Hour Wednesday through Friday from 5:30 pm to 7 pm. The restaurant downstairs is beautiful, but more importantly, the food is spectacular. So far, from the appetizer menu I've had the burrata, and the SPECTACULAR beef carpaccio. I don't normally enjoy raw beef, but this dish is a must have. My friends tried the crab tacos and really liked them as well. My favorite steak is the chateaubriand, and honestly Klaw beats all of the Miami steakhouses I can think of. As far as sides go, I've tried the baby carrots, the bok choy, the mushrooms, the eggplant, and the steak fries (which are the BEST fries I've eaten in years).As its new, the restaurant hasn't been too busy when I've visited, but I presume that with word of mouth that will soon change. Get in there while you still can, trust me...",
      "Hello Stephanie,Thank you for recently visiting Klaw Miami! We are happy to hear you had a great dining experience. Please keep coming back for Cocktail Hour as well as our spectacular beef carpaccio.Look forward to seeing you soon!-The Klaw Team",
      "What an amazing experience! We wanted to try Klaw for some time and are now spoiled with it being so close and having loved it!Klaw is known for its imported meats, but we made note of our preference for seafood and dairy-free options which were accommodated by the server and chef  The gigantic prawn was served with chimichurri sauce (which I usually miss since I don't have steak) and the green salad was a nice helping to start us off. We got a dope wine lesson from the sommelier, Axel, who helped us select the Hyland wine we had with our dinner. The sides of the baby bok Choi and steak frites (sans dairy but loaded with truffle flavor) complemented the pan fried fish dish made special for us.The views are beautiful from the window in the main dining room as well as their rooftop bar, which we previewed after dinner but will be back to hang out at more.If you're in the mood for Miami vibes, amazing high-quality food, superb service, and especially want it on the water, this is a perfect spot to try out - walkable from Edgewater living across fromopera off of North Bayshore!",
      "Hello Katrina,Thank you for recently visiting Klaw Miami! We are happy to hear you had a great dining experience. Please visit us again soon!-The Klaw Team",
      "The restaurant is beautiful, the food is superb, staff is very knowledgeable. The server explained each item on the menu, we were a party of 5, he suggested the amount of food we needed. We had the bacon wedge salad, the Nigerian prawn, the famous crab, steaks cooked to perfection, grilled sweet potato, steak fries and Japanese eggplant. The restaurant is pricey but not for this quality of food. Highly recommend.",
      "Amazing dining experience! Everything from location, decor, service, drinks and food was top notch. There is main dining room and there is also rooftop area with indoor and outdoor seating serving drinks and a limited menu. I recommend having a drink in the rooftop area and then heading downstairs for dining. Overall everything we had was good but the steaks and claws were amazing. It's be better to order everything for the table and share since the portions might be big for individual orders. The highlight for me was the steak. Cooked to perfect temperature and the flavor of the meat itself was unbelievable. They did the \"real deal\" method of having the steak menu categorized by farm/breed instead of just by the different cuts. The candy bar dessert is also a must. Only complaint is valet. It was full and we had to drive around to find street parking. When we were walking it was obvious that they could do a better job organizing the space for valet parking. I've seen valet easily fit twice as many cars in the same area with better organization.",

      "Highlights:* Ultra High End Surf and Turf* The only live King Crabs in South Florida to my knowledge* High End decor and design with old world elegance and great views* Plan on spending at least $400++ per couple for the main dining room* Loud pulsating music does not belong in this elegant space, hopefully   they will correct this or professionals and CEOs will stay away* The outdoor rooftop offers less expensive dining with amazing viewsFood is my passion and takes me to the best culinary destinations in the world. Living in Miami it is great to see such a unique world class restaurant arrive here. My only complaint is why do some restaurants think if they're in Miami they have to blast music and bass in your face while you're trying to have a great meal in an elegant surrounding? We overlooked this for the great food and service, but I have a lot of friends who would not. NB: There currently is no menu posted on their website, you can find one menu photo on Google reviews. Make sure you're ok with the pricing as you can easily spend $700+ on just a whole crab or $325 on a Kobe Ribeye. Steaks do start at $80 though, so there are some more reasonable selections. And you don't have to order a whole $700+ Norwegian King Crab. For $144 you can get a pound ($9 per ounce) of crab legs and claws. The way things are listed on the menu some folks who are mathematically challenged might be in for a shock when they get the bill. If those prices are frightening you can dine on the outdoor 6th floor terrace with sweeping views of the Bay and have a Lobster Roll for only $30, a Crudo for $25 or a Seafood Platter for $90. Service:Kudos to Misha Zelman for selecting a top team and making sure they are really well trained, paying attention to every detail. If you order the King Crab you will enjoy watching them de-shell it for you table-side using special scissors. Your wine and water glasses are always refilled promptly, and someone is always checking on your table to make sure you have what you need. Food:On last night's visit we focused on the seafood. We started with the Seafood Platter ($90) consisting of a few pieces of lobster, spicy prawns, middle neck clams (little necks were served), a little crab and east coast oysters with four very good accompanying sauces. Freshly grated horseradish is available on request and is far better than the prepared version.Next up we had to try the Norwegian King Crab. 99% of the King Crab you will find in restaurants is frozen, cooked at a factory in a brine solution then flash frozen. The only place you will find fresh King Crab is in a place where you can see them swimming in tanks, like here or in the US in some Chinatown restaurants and a few other standouts. Although I enjoy frozen, it often tastes extra salty to me. The Crab here had the softest, freshest taste, and was not salty. For sides we had the thin Charred Green Beans with smoked chile romesco, avocado cream and lime, very good, and the hand cut steak fries with grated parmesan and truffle salsa, crispy and delicious. All sides are $15.We didn't do the steaks on this visit, but I understand they use a Josper like oven using hardwood to slowly cook the steak and you need to allow 45 minutes from order to preparation. Ambience:You enter the 96 year old Spanish Renaissance Building where KLAW has created a 200+- seat dining room with 21 foot high ceilings, large windows with expansive views and a private dining room on the 4th floor. They used the same designer as the Surf Club Restaurant at the Four Seasons and Mr. C (Cipriani) in coconut Grove. The 5th floor is dedicated to their kitchen. The 6th Floor is their indoor bar and outdoor terrace dining with a smaller less expensive menu. Wine:I've included just a few pages in my photos, but the wine list is about 10 pages of around 200 global selections with an emphasis on old world. There are 17 wines by the glass ranging from $13 for Pinot Grigio to $36 for Veuve Cliquot Rose, 7 sakes and some cocktails. To give you an idea of wine markups:Far Niente Chardonnay 2020 Klaw $136  Retail $50Martinelli Zio Tony Chardonnay 2019 Klaw $153 Retail $60Caymus Special Selection 2018 Klaw $434 Retail $200Shafter Hillside Select 2017 Klaw $687 Retail $269Chateau Lafite Rothschild 2014 Klaw $2,950 Retail $800Corkage is $65 with a limit of two bottles or 1 magnumThe Team:Misha Zelman built a collection of 20 restaurants in Russia before emigrating to London to establish some well respected restaurants. Misha is very frank in speaking about the challenges of having a business in Russia where bribery is not a choice but the only option to get anything done and paying for protection by the police, the mafia or an Oligarch is a necessity and cost of doing business. Misha seems uncompromising in his dedication to quality and excellence and has made sure the local team supervised by great talent he has worked with, deliver.",

      "Ok I ate like a pig yelpers at this place‍Definitely try the French toast pancakes and a side of there eggs over easy. To top it off try there Matcha latte it was delicious!  My friend and I sat inside and it was a great atmosphere. It just happened to be 50 degrees in Miami the day I went soooo outside was pretty but not a option. It is a beautiful sight though.   The breakfast was very good here",
      "Pretty solid brunch spot. It's a bit difficult to park in this area I will say. We had a reservation and were seated immediately. The food is pretty good just a bit pricey. The quality of the ingredients was pretty fresh. The salmon tasted delicious.",
      "My family and I had a great time at OL'DAYS! We went on a Sunday, we made a reservation and were seated inside (waited about 30mins to sit). Parking takes a bit to find, and costs $$.The food was good and prices were typical for the midtown area. Waffles: enjoyed the taste! The fruit provided was fresh, and a great amount! Chicken quesadilla: the quesadilla filling was a bit overwhelming. I don't think it needed the extra veggies (corn and sweet potato), just the chicken and cheese tasted good. Egg dish: The tri-colored potatoes in the egg dish were delicious! Wow! Literally could have had those on their own.Avocado toast: good amount of avocado portion! The poached egg was cooked nicely.French toast: seemed to have been cooked using coconut oil, giving the overall French toast taste too much of a coconut taste. The Rosé drink was on the brunch menu and it was delicious! Ol'days was an overall good brunch experience in Miami!",
      "I definitely recommend outdoor seating here. You can soak up the nice weather and you have more space I feel. As for the food, the side of breakfast potatoes were absolutely delicious. It came it an aioli that paired with it so well. I ordered the vegan waffle which was OK. Nothing special and I expected it to be crispy but it fell short of the expectation I had for it.",
      "We had Natalia as our server. She was outstanding! I live on Miamk Beach and we came to midtown. The restaurant was amazing. The food was delicious. They had a 2 for one mimosa special. I wish we had this on the Beach!",
      "I ran into this cute place on yelp while I was in the area. So happy I went...thanks to reviews on here. No wait. Super cute vibe. Exactly what I was looking for. Good food. Good service. Food was great. You can taste the \"real\" in the food. Spices and flavor in eggs. Just wow. French Toast was everything. Bacon eggs just how I like it.",
      "All the food here was delicious! It's a small place though, so you may want to make reservations beforehand. We enjoyed our delicious drinks before eating brunch. The atmosphere was so cute & service was great. Highly recommend!",
      "It's almost like a flattened burrito. It falls apart after every bite, but I still LOVED it. Served with a small cup of mashed avocado & fresh pico de gallo. The waitress was very sweet, made no mistakes, was not rushing. It's a small, quaint place - a VERY good ambiance.",
      "Came here for a belated birthday brunch, we got a pitcher of Bellini's, the golden arepa, fruit and the Buddha bowl with chicken. My friend liked her arepa but my chicken in the bowl was hard as a rock! No joke. I could not cut into it and was super dry when I managed to get a small bite. Had to send it back which I hate doing. The server rarely checked on us and we had to flag him down a few times. They already include an 18% service fee and just hand you the total without a break down and ask for tip again so be ready for that. For the price and service, I probably won't be back.",
      "If you want to experience some LA vibe in Miami, this would be the place. Ig friendly and wait wasn't that long. However, make reservations before u go."

Varun was our waiter last night and he was great.  Very attentive.  Spot on with his recommendations.  Very friendly and competent.  The food was delicious.  We had three different entrees... two appetizers and dessert.  The portions were a good size and quality ingredients.   Very large vegetarian options too.

      "Solid India food and  knowledgeable staff...  definitely worth a visit. The food scene on 79th street from Collins to Biscayne Blvd is really coming alive... worth a trip for casual Foodies.",
      "I previously gave four stars and compliments to this restaurant. However it was many months before we could make it back here, and I am afraid the entire experience has changed, making me wonder if ownership or management is new... the samosas were half the size, the Tikka Masala was a deep red color and tasted EXACTLY like Chef Boyardee Spaghettios from a can (obviously, they just spooned some tomato paste in to make more sauce and didn't even let it cook down to remove the bitterness). And worst of all, the Tandoori Chicken my friends ordered was covered in a thick grainy baste that contained a high level of something tasting like bleach.I am not one for insulting a restaurant for having a bad night, especially after I had such a great experience a few months previous. But the 100% change in food quality across the board was too alarming to let it slide this time. Obviously, nail in the coffin on this place for us. :(Go to Bombay Darbar instead. It's worth the drive to the Grove.",

      "Had the chicken Saag which is a cream spinach based masterpiece. I normally do not go for spinach but this is not your regular plate. Varun was my waiter and he said it was the house special, so I took his suggestion and won big time.",
      "Great quality and amount per serving .  Fantastic flavors but ...It is soooooooooo spicy.  Even if you ask for the Mildest. Their \" mild\"  is too hot for the average person . After glasses and glasses of water couldnt finish it . Went home hungry. It's a shame b/c otherwise the food would be excellent. I do not know why do this,  you can always make it hotter for whomever requests it. Instead of loosing 90 % of patrons. That is where Zayka and Darbar get it right, and are always full. Indian food has so many wonderful spices why drown everything with heat instead of making it optional for you to add as much heat as you want.",
      "So Taste Buds of India is under new management and is now Indian Spice. Slightly high prices and small portions because Indian is treated like a delicacy in Miami. The food was delicious though. Service is very good. Interior is bright and clean. They also have a few tables outside in the Normandy Fountain square. They have lunch specials. I'll be back again soon.",

      "Super authentic and excellent service. Our server explained us the menu well and was very kind. Will come again soon.",
      "The food was alright but I really enjoyed the atmosphere. I feel like the food could have come a little quicker.",
      "Taste Buds of India..you were my all time favorite restaurant for my Indian food cravings but lately, I don't know what's going on with your food!!!I used to always get the Lamb vindaloo (Extra spicy) and kashmiri naan! Everything about them used to be perfect! The level of spice, the sweetness of the Kashmiri naan, just YUM! However, the last time I ordered from you guys, the lamb vindaloo was mainly just oil and the kashmiri naan was just alright..was a little lighter in the filling but still ok. We sometimes have a bad night so I decided to give you another chance!This time though definitely made me realize this will be the last time I ever order again from here unfortunately! I ordered a lamb tikka masala to change it up and my usual Kashmiri naan. The lamb tikka masala was a tiny portion and tasted like tomato sauce and cream mixed with little bits of meat. I have had better frozen Indian food than that! There were NO vegetables in it at all either. And the Kashmiri naan tasted like a regular naan! There was pretty much NO filling and was super unsatisfactory. So disappointing and what a waste of money :( Hope you guys can get back to the amazing quality you used to serve. But this is my goodbye",
      "Worst $50 delivery I've ever had. \"No onions\" salad loaded with onions. Lamb curry \"mild\" so spicy you could barely taste the meat. It looked like a bowl of spicy red sauce with the small pieces of meat swimming in it. Couldn't tell if it was lamb, dog, goat, with the amount of spicy sauce covering it. Definitely not much of it for the price. No other ingredients in it. Naan bread was unremarkable. On a positive note - jasmine rice was good and delivery took less than 30 min. I think it's because they just microwaved some of the leftovers from the day before, lol. Next time I'll just get a can of Dinty Moore stew from the gas station. Much cheaper and same amount of enjoyment."

      "Amazing steakhouse Our favorite was the the Australian Wagyu which I can only say was perfection. their sides were so perfectly complimentary. Truffle Mac and cheese, the Brussels sprouts, spinach, broccolini and cauliflower were excellent. Beef lettuce wraps were decent, beet salad was good, kids meals were devoured. ALSO if you're here for breakfast their buffet is great",
      "WOW - To say I was completely blown away by my first time dining here would be an understatement. Whether you're celebrating a special occasion or just craving a delectable meal that will leave you speechless, this is the spot that will be sure to leave a lasting impression. From the lavish and trendy decor, the out of this world dishes, beautiful presentations and impeccable service, every detail was taken well into consideration and perfected.I can say with certainty that this is one of the most gorgeous spaces I've ever eaten a meal in. The sultry vibe, elegantly designed interior, endless display of wine bottles scattered throughout the restaurant and the stunning bar will have you feeling like you're in the midst of dining amongst celebrities. There didn't seem to be a bad table to dine at in sight, but my parents and I were lucky enough to snag one of the beautiful half-moon booths toward the center of the room. When is the last time you've been to a restaurant that brings complimentary French fries to the table? And not just any regular ole' French fries, but a delicious trio of French fries each complimented by their own unique dipping sauce? Bet it's probably never happened before, unless you've eaten here. I thought this was such a neat but simple touch that really set them apart from other high-end restaurants. They also bring yummy rolls topped with sea salt to the table (between the fries & the bread, you might end up in a food coma before you even order if you're not careful). I ordered the tuna tartar for an appetizer and I was in heaven every time I took a bite. Not only does it melt in your mouth, but the presentation alone is enough reason to order this (the way they mix it for you makes for a fun video opportunity if you have your phone ready to record). My parents shared a shrimp cocktail that they both enjoyed - The shrimp were massive! Following the appetizers, I munched on a cesar salad which was perfectly dressed. Now... the STEAK. Holy moly, one of the best filet mignons I have had yet. It was ridiculously flavorful, tender & juicy. Melted in your mouth and bursted with flavor. If you're a steak lover, it would be a crime to come here and not order it. The mashed potatoes that accompanied it were also flavorful, but I thought they were a little too runny (my only complaint of the whole meal). If you're a fan of grilled onions, do yourself a favor and order a side of these to top your steak with and thank me later. The \"Smoked Chocolate S'mores\" dessert was ridiculously decadent and was the perfect finish to an impeccable meal. Yes, it's insanely pricy and yes, it's totally worth it. My experience here was one of the best dining experiences I've ever had in Miami - And that says a lot given the fact that Miami is one of the hottest spots in the country for foodies. This restaurant hit it out the park for me and I'm already searching for an excuse to go back to South Florida and to savor new dishes on their menu.",
      "The restaurant is spacious and nice. Bar is nice as well.Staff was friendly and attentive.For appetizers the tuna tartare was fresh and seasoned well.They also bring you French fries 3 different ways with 3 different sauces. I had the certified Angus rib cap cooked medium rare and It was good and flavorful. The side of Mac and Cheese was good as well.",
      "Our favorite was the the Australian Wagyu which I can only say was perfection.",
      "Ambiance was awesome. The dishes, coctails and the dessert were so delicious. All the employees were so polite and friendly. They celebrated our honeymoon with a cute card, it was so nice.They made our special day unforgettable.",
      "Wonderful experience! Fabulous service. Timing, everything was a 10.  Our server really made our night fabulous, she was awesome. Great steak, Mac and cheese with truffle was really nice. Molten cake was super good as well. I must say everything was impeccable.",
      "Phenomenal cuisine. Never have a enjoyed such a succulent and flavourful sea bass - it is one of their renowned specials. But the lack of bones in the fish was made up for by the pained bones in my rear.The decor was beautiful but very far from comfortable. The low chairs were too uncomfortable for eating. The benches; built for slaves.The overall experience was truly hampered by a god awful designer deserving of life in prison for her domestic terror on comfort. 4/5 not bad",

      "Food was incredible. I love that when you get to the table instead of getting some bread you get french fries. Service was also impeccable and ambiance is very family friendly in my opinion"

      "Awesome place!! First time here. Food was amazing. Staff was great. The shrimp garlic noodles was amazing. The boil bag was good. BE SURE TO SPECIFY THE CRAB LEGS YOU WANT. Don't just say boil bag with crab legs. Also: the boil bags is priced per item you want in the bag. You have to pay for each item you want in the boil bag. They also provide hair ties...that was sweet. Over all it was great and would r definitely come back. Thank you",

      "I had fairly respectable expectations walking in here. I mean, a boil is a boil. Typically the sauces are all kind of the same and the choices are all kind of the same, so I wasn't expecting miracles, just some good food. Our waitress was very friendly and accommodating, our food came out quickly, and it was steaming hot! The sauce was amazing. The food was very fresh and overall it was a satisfying meal. One of my friends had the lemon pepper wings and he didn't like them very much, but I'm not sure if it's because he thought it would be more of a sauce instead of dry rub - but neither here or there. I had the Dungeness crab legs and I thought they were incredible! Really good prices and a nice stop if you're looking for a good meal.",

      "Cajun Boil is pretty much a version of Boiling Crab in Alhambra, CA. You have the butcher paper covering the tables, the plastic bibs, gloves, and the huge bags containing your seafood boil ingredients in a cajun, garlic, spicy, lemon sauce.Food:1) Alligator bites - Surprisingly good! A bit tougher than chicken bites but the batter was light. I'd order these again.2) Seafood Boil: Alaskan King Crab and Shrimp. The shrimps were huge and the sauce was delicious. The flavor of the sauce wasn't as dank as the original cajun seafood boil location in LA. Service:Excellent. Friendly. Quick",

      "We stumbled upon Amigo grill on the way to get a boba tea nearby. My wife was hungry and wanted something to pick on and they had a picanha special so she ordered it. First off it was delicious. The meat was flavorful and cooked perfectly. The steak fries were warm and salted perfectly. The chimichurri sauce to go with the steak was perfection. The staff was very nice and once we left we knew we had to come back to support them. Fast forward a week and we decided to come in on a Saturday night. The inside is not huge but it is intimate. There is enough space for about 20 people inside and 2 outside. They had a dinner special for 2 which we ordered with a upgrade of a pitcher of sangria. The sangria was delicious and was good enough for about 6 cups. The dinner special was 2 plates each with a 8 oz picanha and steak fries. It was more than enough food for my wife and I. Again the staff and service was amazing. I'm so glad we stumbled across amigo grill and will continue to come back to support them. Everything was great!",
      "I loved the food at this place. Yummy! Service was excellent and staff was very friendly and attentive. Its rather small inside but good enough for me. We also tried outside seating since we decided to go back. I recommend this place hands down.",
      "The food was delicious we got the dinner special picanha and sausage with fries for 2 with a bottle of wine. It was perfect and the mini cheese arepitas sooo good as an app! The owner was serving and it was great service and a little quaint spot. Totally recommend and will be back soon",
      "We went to Amigo after reading some excellent reviews. We were not at all disappointed. Service was quick and friendly. We got a skirt steak special for two. Included was a pitcher of sangria. The steak was prepared perfectly. We definitely recommend this little steakhouse on Miracle Mile.",
      "This place is located in the Miracle Mile. There is metered street parking that you pay for through an app or there are also garages nearby. It is right on the corner and has indoor dining and outdoor patio dining on the sidewalk. My server was very friendly and welcoming.It is true to its name and is a casual place, but a few items on the menu will make you dig deep into your wallet. I ordered the Prime Skirt Steak, which came with a sausage and steak fries. It took me about 10 minutes to get my food. The steak and sausage was grilled and seasoned perfectly. It was delicious. The fries were decent. It was all fresh. The restaurant has tables and bar seating and is kind of trendy. They have new wave music playing throughout the restaurant while you dine. I recommend this place if you are looking for a good steak, but do not want to go to one of the ritzy joints and sit there all night. It is definitely worth a try.",
      "Excellent. Excellent. A quaint and cozy restaurant in miracle mile. The steak was amazing. Highly recommend them.",
      "Affordable and underrated. This place doesn't look like much when you pass by. I drove by it so many times in the past but never thought to stop and give it a try. I left the Urgent Care that's near by on Sunday at 8 pm and was dying of hunger. I was headed to another restaurant when I saw Amigo Grill and decided to stop there and get a quick bite. I shared the picanha and fries with my boyfriend along with a caesar salad. Everything was amazing and who I think is the owner was very attentive and kind. The food came out really fast and was very tasty. The water I was served tasted weird, and couldn't drink it, but I didn't care too much. I would eat here again!",
      "Hands down the best steak i have had in years. Their skirt steak is so tender (medium rare) and full of flavor. So glad i this place. They only have a few tables inside, shop i suggest calling ahead for a reservation.",

The food was extremely salty. Quality excellent but all we could taste was the salt.I could not eat it because I suffer from hypertension. One bite and the salt went straight to my head. Today is Tuesday and I still have a headache.If I ever  go back I would make sure to ask them to go easy on the salt. I tried calling to speak with the manager about my experience but mailbox is always full.",
      "We were on the Bib Gourmand trail and Doya was our next stop. So glad we gave this place a try. A mezze bar with beautiful, tastefully designed outdoor oasis. Now for some rant - We had made reservations in advance and requested outdoor seating. They have a huge indoor dining area too and the hostess, upon checking in, tried to veer us towards the indoor dining area, which I wasn't quite happy about. When we asked for a table outdoors she said there were none available. And then when I told her we had requested outdoor dining and don't mind waiting, she was able to get us a table within a few minutes. So that was settled, but her attitude was a put-off. Alright, rant over.The best part - Our waitress was super nice though. We ordered the Bursa & the Doya Spritz. Both were strong & super delicious. We also ordered a variety of mezze, both hot and cold. The cold mezze came right away. The hot ones followed soon after. For a busy restaurant I must say the service was super quick. The waitress first brought out lavash bread, baguettes and some olives. Then the mezzes followed. Haydari, Muhammara, Piyaz, zucchini pancakes, fries, borani, kopoglu, cabbage kebap. Everything was served family-style. A feast, nonetheless. So so good. I was pretty impressed with the compostable takeout containers too. The ambience, food and service make it a must, must-try.",
      "TLDR: good food, trendy vibes, busy/bustling, great new restaurant in Miami for pretty much any occasion. SETTING: made a reservation a few weeks in advance for 8:00pm on a Thursday night for four people. When we arrived there was quite the long line of people checking in for their reservations, but moved quickly by the hostess. We were seated inside after being told we would have to wait an hour for a table outside.The space is gorgeous- it's industrial, with a huge bar that takes up a lot of space and looks like a fun place to sit. There is also a large outdoor space with lights strung up that was completely full when we arrived. It looked like they accommodate lots of larger parties (4-5+).FOOD: the food was good! They suggested ordering 3-4 from the cold mezze and 4-5 from the hot mezze, for a group of four people. The menu is extensive but the server clearly knew which were fan favorites as those were the ones he suggested. We ordered two dips (muhammara and Cretan feta) and the doya octopus. The Cretan feta dip is no joke. It was completely demolished and is a must order- it's unlike any other feta dip I've had before. The red pepper dip was good but nothing to write home about. The doya octopus was my favorite. It's grilled so again, the taste and texture was unlike any other octopus dish I've tried! Our server tried to steer us away from it to the hot mezze octopus but I'm glad we tried it! For the hot mezze we ordered: pacanga pie (cheesy pastrami egg roll basically), the sucuk (beef sausage in a delicious sauce), Adana kebab (spiced lamb kebab), the manti (beef dumplings almost like baby pierogis), shrimp ouzo, and zucchini and spinach pancake.My personal favorites were the sucuk and pancakes but everyone like different things- I thought the pacanga pie was just too much cheese, not enough meat; the shrimp ouzo was okay; the Adana kebab was okay but nothing special and the manti was good but again, nothing special.SERVICE: our server was excellent! It was extremely busy, but he was always available and around and helpful in guiding us through the menu and offering helpful suggestions for both food and drink. We were basically in and out within 2 hours. They RUN the food out. The pita bread that we thought comes with the dips came 5-10 mins after the dips, and we were charged something like $5-10 for EACH piece. I thought that was odd it wasn't included with the dip, but not the servers fault!VERDICT: I can see why this beautiful restaurant is quite popular. It's in a great, trendy, fun neighborhood, and has a cool, buzzy vibe. The food is great for sharing so a good place for larger parties. Just don't expect to be bowled over by the food and you'll have a good night!",
      "honestly, after the 40 minute drive south to get to this place, I really wanted to like it. First impressions are really amazing, the space is nicely done, lots of greenery, even though the tables are kind of close, because of all the greenery, it seems like you have your own private space.I suppose one of the best things was the minute you ordered a drink, it was within about three minutes at your table already! Even with that, the drinks are the best thing about this place. All the drinks were very tasty, well presented and cold. some are very small tho, the one in the Roman statue head we had to hunt for the liquid! The most disappointing thing about this place however, with the food. The portions are small and just ok. We had the sausages which were WAY over salty. I always finish everything, but debated leaving these. We had the lamb chops which were over cooked. We asked how they were prepared, we were told medium, we asked for them medium rare but still they came out well. Did not want to ask for them to be sent back as these took the longest to come out and by then we were starting to fill up. The rice that it was served on however was delicious. Muscles were in a great sauce tho! We had a bunch of the appetizers, really none of them stand out.All in all, this was an ok spot. Definitely not worth what we paid, I doubt we will be back unless we went to the bar and just had some drinks. Three stars for the speed of drinks, atmosphere, muscles and the rice from the lamb. No valet till 5p I think.",
      "Have visited several times, the service and food seems to get worse each time. Will not return. This latest visit i call for a reservation, the hostess turns me down. I go on opentable reservations were available at any time of my choosing. I arrive, plenty of tables available. We place our drink order, the waitress is very persistent about taking the food order. We place our full order, all but one dish arrived within 10-15 minutes. The dishes were okay, not as good as previous times, shrimp/meatballs/a few dipping/ sauces/etc. We had one dish pending, a steak and fries. We bring it to the attention of the waitress. She says should be out soon, we order second round of drinks. We ask her a second time, she gives an excuse. She comes back a third time asks us if steak has not arrived, get another excuse. Another waiter sees the table empty, i tell him we have been waiting 40 minutes no steak, cancel the order, and give us the check. He insist not to cancel the order, by this point im annoyed, it takes another 10 minutes to bring the medium steak and fries. I tell them to pack it up as we no longer want to eat it. They offer a free desert to compensate for the 50 minute late $35 steak, the dessert was terrible, went elsewhere for s desert. The experience was upsetting, especially for $250. I hate to give bad reviews, but this time its well deserved.",
      "Ok this place is great. It's in the middle of wynwood which makes it a perfect pre-going out dinner spot. The ambiance is great both inside and outside - definitely a bougie/fancy spot to eat at. I would recommend getting reservations ahead of time but if you get there in the early evening, you could probably walk in. Parking is tough - street parking or garage parking will have to do.Ok the main points: the food. Phenomenal. Lots of vegetarian options, mainly in the cold dishes. There are a few hot dishes for my fellow vegetarians but the only hot dish I'd recommend would be the truffle cheese pita one and that is only if you like a lot of cheese. The cauliflower dish is not worth IMO. Stack up on the cold dishes - every single one was delicious (more than expected) and the fig salad was 10/10. The drinks are also very very yum!The service is so so kind - our waiter did an excellent job recommending us dishes and also helped us when we looked lost. Price is high but as expected for a spot like this! Enjoy!!!",
      "Oh Doya.... How have I eaten at your tasty establishment so many times and never wrote a review? I fell in love with Doya the second I found out it was a gin bar. I mean, damn, they have gin from around the world and all different kinds of infusions and I'm here for it! Doya also has a Turkish chef - so the menu has influences from Turkey and the Mediterranean. I come here A LOT, sometimes with a res (recommended) and sometimes I eat at the bar (tapas style). They start you off with complimentary bread (which I like more than the lavash) and olives. My favorite dips are the Muhammara (red pepper dip), Beetroot dip and pastrami hummus. The Shrimp Ouzo, Greek salad, Truffle Pide and mussels are my favorite sharing dishes. The branzino is also amazing and is a whole fish with bone and all that is a little harder to eat but shouldn't get skipped.",
      "Had a great Saturday night at Doya! The vibe is truly great, the bar was packed and the ambiance is laid back yet sophisticated. We were a party of 4 the waiter stated that the dishes were tapas style and that we should order 8 to 10 dishes in order to feel satisfied.  HE OVER SOLD us plates, there is nothing tapas about their dishes. Order less and if you still feel hungry order more. The average drink is about $25 since they are using top shelf liquor. How ever they can be very sugary so you might want to stick to wine. We had the short ribs (lacked flavor) The lamb chops (bland) The spicy tougher sauce (fantastic) The chicken thighs (slamming) The calamari (skip is sooo basic) The skirt steak with fries ( a must fries were crispy and steak was tender) The bread for the table (fresh out of the oven/ fantastic) The olives for the table ( can't go wrong with olives ) Octopus (soft and tender) Kebap (it was alright) Over all you should stop by, but it wasn't memorable. Make sure to order less and work your way up. As you can see from the pictures those aren't tapas dishes!",
      "Parking is a bit crazy near Doya (as most of Wynnwood). Reservations had us seated within 5 minutes, seamless. They had a good flow of traffic entering. Outdoor seating on a cooler fall night was hard to get. Inside is trendy, music, lots of movement and intimate lighting. Seating comfortable. Ample drink menu which I didn't try. Lots of hot and cold shareables to enjoy. They start you with olives and warm bread. That was nice. Got the lamb Adana kebab, it was flavorful and came with a number of thin pitas. Also tried a cold red pepper dip as well as bean dish. The red pepper dip and kebab were amazing. I enjoyed the beans too, but wish that was a hot dish. Also tried the octopus (charcoal grilled) which was as expected. The add on pita's weren't worth it. They looked better than tasted and were over priced. Esp since other dishes came with pitas. Too full to try dessert but they had some interesting and appetizing options. Service was friendly. I'd come back again. I felt the food and vibe was worth the price. My main gripe is the parking in the area.",
      "I love having a five star restaurant in Wynwood! I can see why it took us so long to get in. It is a beautiful restaurant and quite large for Wynwood. It is noisy but the energy can be infectious. Our lovely waiter Nicholas made some great suggestions as well as the diners to the left of us. We did order too much food as the small plates aren't that small. We had the Manti (beef dumplings) so good, Sucuk (sausage), Short Ribs, Fries, Chicken Thigh, Red Pepper Humus, Adana Kebap (Lamb) and the Branzino Ceviche. Like I said too much food for three. The have to haves....Branzino Ceviche, fries, chicken thigh and Short Ribs. All so tasty! Did I mention the cocktails are amazing!"

      "5 stars for the best cheesecake I've ever eaten, as well as some dishes I cannot forget.Leku is one of my absolute favorite meals in Miami for a few reasons:1- Ambiance: This hidden gem is absolutely gorgeous. You show up to the Rubell museum and there is no sign of a restaurant until you walk through the gate and past a little garden. It's an indoor/outdoor space that is as cool as ice. I'm talking kickass mural over the bar, drawn 2d molding on the walls and columns, and stylish furniture. But it is not style over substance at this restaurant...2- The Food: there are at least three dishes I will never NOT order at Leku: *** The cheesecake (the craziest empty Basque cheesecake you've ever had- and also the best!), *** The beet appetizer (looks like artwork, tastes complex and fresh!), *** And the mushroom rice (another vegetarian dish?? YUP. This is like a mushroom risotto paella and I simply cannot get enough). My rec: order all three and then keep ordering for the table. Truly everything I've tried here is noteworthy.3- The cocktails and secret garden: hope you arrive early so you can grab a cocktail at the secondary bar surrounded by tropical plants, with seating that makes you feel like you've stumbled upon a secret garden oasis. The cocktails and wine list are fabulous and beautifully crafted.4- The service: They know how to make you feel special here. Every person who interacts with you is serving excellence. They're professional and friendly and it made me feel like I was spending a million bucks (and I wasn't!)All in all, I won't visit Miami without hitting up Leku and I suggest you discover it for yourself!",
      "***FOOD:   Food was good and beautifully plated, pretty to look at. Smaller portions. Had the tartare, lamb, octopus, sliders, & some other things can't recall***COST (OUT OF 4$)  $ $  $ $ unbelievably expensive.  Definitely go when they have their lunch tasting menu. The first time we went we had the tasting menu, the next time we didn't realize they only had that menu on certain days and ended up paying $400 for lunch. Be sure to ask the price of the specials as they're not priced and only mentioned by the server. It was crazy expensive for a smidgen appetizer special. obviously we left hungry and thoroughly unsatisfied.  For the price took off 1 star***DÉCOR:   elegant tea time decor, garden party decor.  white contempoary modern, many ladies having a celebratory bday or special occasion lunch/dinner there. seemed very upper class pretenatious***SERVICE: Service/ Server 1 star taken off.   our server was extremely condescending. we came to see the museum and decided to have lunch so we were not dressed to the nines. he had a haughty air about him and we could feel that he didn't think we belonged or could afford this place.  he did not check on us and the only other time we saw him again was at the end when he presented the check to us, otherwise we saw the water & bread person and the food runners.  yeah we weren't dressed in our sunday best but hey, we were on vacation and was going to see a museum.  the food came quick and was beautifully composed,  ***RECOMMEND: MEH on recommendation and probably will never go back. Perfect place for special occasions, or when you need to impress (business luncheon, new in-laws, trying to one up your faux friends maybe), basically for the pretentious and rich",
      "This is a Micheline recommended restaurant in Allapathah which is not a nice area in Miami; however, the restaurant inside is completely different just like they say \"don't judge a book by its cover\". Inside the restaurant it is modern elegant with a patio like forest. The food is very good, we got the $175 menu experience that included 11 different items + 2 chef surprises. The food was perfect and delicious, almost like a piece of art but it is an expensive experience. Excelente customer service, our waitress knew every single ingredient in the food and was very nice.",
      "Leku is one of the few restaurants that offer Miami Spice on the weekends, so we went with our friends who couldn't do Spice lunch during the weekdays. It's not difficult to find street parking, and it's free. The entrance is a little hidden. It's a small metal gate that you probably expect to be locked, but walk through and you'll see the museum exhibits on your right through the glass, and the restaurant's garden cafe on your left. A few hundred feet further and you'll see the museum shop, entrance, as well as the restaurant. I got the beet tartare for appetizer - though I thought it was BEEF until the dish arrived. Still delicious enough that I was thinking that next time I am at the supermarket I'll pick up some beet and try making it myself. The beef did come in the entree in the form of veal cheek.  And it's about the best I've ever tried, fork tender, succulent, melt-in-your-mouth divine.I splurged (it's $6 extra) for the Basque Cheese Tart, and it's well worth it.  It's runny soft inside, rich and creamy, almost like a flan. Every course was a delight, the service was attentive and it was a a great experience.",
      "My fiancé and I did Miami Spice on a Saturday night here. We had an amazing experience. From start to finish, service was amazing. We made a reservation and arrived earlier than expected, but we're still seated right away. This is the type of restaurant that pulls out the chair for you and changed your plates, i.e. a fine dining experience. Our server Harold was amazing. He was able to tell us about different items on the menu. We ended up taking ALL OF his suggestions for the Miami spice menu and it was PERFECT.For appetizers we ordered the ENSALADILLA DE PATATAS CON SALMON CURADO, which is a potato salad with cured tuna and trout roe. It was a flavor punch, yet light and delicious. We also ordered the TERRINE DE FOIE GRAS ($5 up charge). I could have licked the plate clean. The richness of the foie gras combined with the sweetness of the marmalade was perfection. For entrees we ordered the ARROZ DE SETAS, basically a mushroom risotto, and the CARRÉ DE CORDERO A BAJA TEMPERATURA (add $15), lamb rack. The lamb was out of this world. Harold explained that the lamb is sous vide for 48 hours. It's well worth the up charge because the lamb was fall off the bone tender and the flavor was phenomenal. Smoky and tangy. Just a amazing. Desser was the famous baked cheesecake and chocolate tarts. Both was very good. I preferred the cheesecake and my fiancé preferred the chocolate. Overall, the experience at Leku is definitely 5/5. Service was amazing, from our server, Harold, to the bus boys and the floor manager who checked on us frequently. Food and drinks are so well thought out. I highly recommend. We will certainly return!",
      "This restaurant is very uniquely located. It's across from SuperBlue inside the Rubbell Museum. You get a lovely open concept to dine either indoors or outdoors. PRO TIP: I recommend outdoors. The food was delicious and service prompt and attentive. PRO TIP: get the aged, slow cooked lamb and you can never go wrong with a side of fries. This place is perfect for a new ambience and date night.",
      "I came here for my dad's birthday lunch after we toured the Rubell museum. It was delicious Spanish food! The croquetas were very tasty - not the Cuban type of croquetas but the Spanish ones, filled with lots of bechamel sauce. We had the tortilla española which just melts in your mouth. The cracker with tomato is SOOOO good. Highly recommend it and we were able to split it between 4 people. The mushroom rice was very good and good size for one person. We finished with the traditional tarta de queso (cheesecake) and it was so good we had to order two of them. Everything was very tasty and I'd come back, no doubt. We did valet parking when we got there, I didn't see if there was good street parking. The service was fantastic and it was right next to the museum so we went immediately after and did not have to wait for our table. We sat inside, the windows were open but it wasn't hot. It is definitely an expensive restaurant but it's high quality, Spanish food. They had a good wine list as well. Nothing bad about this experience.",
      "This restaurant is in an industrial neighborhood next door to the Rubell museum.  It's not easy to find so use your GPS.  The Miami Spice menu that they have through the end of September is interesting, and also turned out to be delicious.   These are fixed menus that are offered for two months each year through the Miami Spice program. My friends and I all started with the Terrine de Foie Gras appetizer.  That was a good way to start since it was delicious.  For a five dollar upcharge it was worth it.  Then I moved on to the braised Wagyu veal cheeks. The meat was so tender you could cut it with a fork, no knife required.  Two people in our party had duck breast and they both pronounced it excellent.  I finished with the Basque cheese tart which was also good.  But I also want to go back for the chocolate Ganache tart. #miamispice #miami #fine dining",
      "Had dinner here with a friend this evening and it was amazing. This is a tapas restaurant and we had croquettes, Galician style octopus, short rib sliders, and seafood rice. I had never had octopus Galician style and it was delicious. The short rib sliders were also good and the sauce with seafood rice exceeded all expectations.  The surprise were the ham croquettes.  They were not the traditional croquettes that I grew up with.  The ham was mixed with a sauce that was out of this world. The chocolate dessert at the ending the evening capped off. great meal.",
      "Dined there last Friday for my daughter's birthday, food was very good and our waiter was great! But the assistant manager should find another line of work. We where sitting outside and I lit a cigar as allowed in many miami restaurants, after 2 minutes I was told to please turn it off, I quickly turned it off. After 10 minutes the manager came to the table and told me very rudely that I could not be holding my unlit cigar in my hand.As this escalated to a heated discussion, as far as I know a cigar that is not lit can not bother anyone!Because of a stupid manager we will never be back there are much better restaurants in Miami with professional employees!",
      "Amazing service, ambiance and food.Its a bit out of the way and attached to Rubell museum. Its wonderful atmosphere. They also have hidden patio for small bites & drinks if you dont have reservations.Definitely try the san sebastian cheesecake soo good!"

      "My cousin (a local) recommended we meet at Bakan before a visit to the Wynwood Walls and he couldn't have picked a better spot. Both the staff and the food were outstanding.  There's lots of paid street parking as well as a few lots around the area but it wasn't hard to find a spot quickly. Upon arriving we were promptly greeted at the host stand in front of the patio - which was packed and very lively. I opted for indoor seating because I love air conditioning.We started with the guacamole which was so fresh and chunky. Instead of regular chips, they have larger blue and white fried tortillas that aren't as salty so the flavor comes out. Then we shared the delicious carnitas tacos. They are street tacos but still filling. My mojito was smooth and just sweet enough with tons of fresh mint. My cousin and his friend also shared the rib eye steak that came with a cheese stuffed poblano pepper, roasted corn on the cob a giant scallion, guacamole and soft tortillas for making your own tacos (think fajitas but fresher).Bakan has an open kitchen area and a glass wall of wine and spirits to go along with the great decor and even better food. It would be worth the drive from Coral Gables even if we hadn't planned an afternoon at the Wynwood Walls (10 minute walk at most). I highly recommend Bakan - a great place to hang  out and enjoy inspired food and drinks.",
      "Came here for lunch the other day and was pleasantly surprised - especially after traveling to Mexico City. I got the chicken suizas and they were really good and I'm normally not a big enchilada fan. My friend got a chicken / mole dish and he loved it too! The vibe of Bakan is really fun and in the heart of Wynwood. Can't wait to come back and try the margaritas too.",
      "The best Mexican restaurant in Miami!The food is fresh, modern, and delicious.  The mezcal selection is very large and the cocktails are well crafted. There is a section on their menu for more adventurous palates with insects... I did not try any of those but to each his own! I will definitely be back when I'm in the area!",
      "Love the decor here! The staff and service is excellent, they are very attentive and friendly. I like that the place is open and airy and has TV's to watch sports games. The menu offers a wide variety of food and drinks to choose from. They even have an \"insect\" section that doesn't call my name though, haha! I had shrimp tacos and it was delicious & fresh. The table also had guacamole & chips and the Elote corn. I also had the coal drink with a cute ladder decor on it. Lastly, we had the churros dessert, and it was refreshing and delicious!I will be returning to try out more!",
      "We started with the cacalas caseras and it was middle grade at best. The guacamole on the blue chip tortillas  were okay but the goat cheese was the redeeming quality. The ambiance is a fun atmosphere with low lighting and really cool decor like cactus that is painted exquisitely. It is extremely loud and the large tables make it hard to hear but it is great seeing everyone around you laugh and enjoy the atmosphere. Service was very slow but our server was very kind. We then continued onto the guacamole and it was very bland at best. The blue corn tortillas taste like dry corn powder. Out came the chicken tacos and they were housed in stale and hard blue chip tortilla wraps. The chicken was cooked to perfection but the seasoning and sauces were overpowering. The shrimp tacos were very fresh with a zesty sauce that enhanced the overall flavors of the shrimp. The street corn was a different type of corn, using white corn with a lot of sour cream versus the flavorful cheesy sauce that were accustomed to however it was still decent. The beans were cold and wet tasting like they were dropped outside in a puddle during a high traffic day. Don't believe the hype,",
      "This restaurant is Mexican food with a twist. The place is beautiful situated is a corner street in Wynwood.  It offer both outdoor and indoor seating with beautiful decor and we were lucky to have Allison as our server who was superb. She was friendly,  always attentive and made sure we had our food in time in order to make it to our museum entrance time close by. She is awesome.We ordered blue corn tortillas with guacamole and black bean. It came with goat cheese which for me was a bit over powering but otherwise good. Then I ordered  chicken enchiladas with mole negro. They were of good size but it had goat cheese so again over powered the taste of the mole and I love mole. So I scraped off the goat cheese. It is not spicy for those people who don't like it spicy but for me had to add some homemade hot sauce. It is nice place to hang out and for those who like to drunk, they do prepare lots of great cocktails I've been told.",
      "If you're not a fan of blue corn tortillas (like me) this may not be the spot for you. Wynwood is so full of lovely restaurants and bars, so if you wander around and follow the sound of music you may find a spot you like. We happened to walk past Bakan and it caught our attention because of the music. Bakan has tons of mezcal choices to choose from, and a lot of shareable plates. We ordered the corn and the queso fundido as snacks since we were already full from dinner but wanted to munch on something. The corn kernels were huuuge and unlike anything I've ever seen before. They had sort of a bean-like texture which I was not a big fan of. The queso fundido was good, no real complaints other than the price to quality ratio. Came out of here feeling less satisfied than when I walked in.",
      "Didn't have a reservation on a busy Saturday evening and got a table for 2 right away...the table wasn't the best as it was next to dirt and concrete connecting the next door facilty but whatever...the waiter was attentive and nice and the food was prepared fast...when I say fast, I mean you order and 10 min later your foods is on the table, mind you, we both ordered tacos so they are fast to make but I was happy that we didn't have to wait for our food! So we ordered pork tacos, chicken tacos (more like taquitos) and Mushroom tacos and they were all so delicious! Def would go back...just hopefully get a better table.",
      "Found this place when doing. G@@gle search. The food service and atmosphere did not disappoint. We had guacamole and chips (not your regular chips). Chips are made in house using blue cornmeal and attention round, little bigger thicker then regular chips. They don't serve a big basket full and that's ok . This way you'll have room for the food!My friend had a Suiza chicken burrito and I had a salad with skirt steak add on. We were both very happy with our choices. We also had their house margarita - perfection!",
      "Wynwood can be quite popular, and I've found it's not a good idea when you have guests to try to grab a table as a walk-in. I was chill knowing I had reservations at a place my daughter recommended. I did raise an eyebrow when I found out Bakan was Mexican. My out of town guests were from Albuquerque and Tucson, so I hoped Bakan would pass their cultivated taste tests.We misthought that Bakan was another block or so away as we approached, and our spirits lifted as we came across this super cute place. My guests seemed enthralled so I caved and said let's go look at the menu, we can always skip out on our reservation, but then we saw the Bakan sign above the entranceway. Yay. The whole outside vibe is so earthy and natural. We even saw little birds sitting up in the ceiling woodwork. Inside is lovely, too, and I would describe it as just a tad more sophisticated. And yes, inside has the air conditioning. That might factor in when you make your online seating preference. But ours was an incredibly lovely Miami day, so we were very happy to enjoy our seats outside. Our teacher had to order the Hops for Teacher draft, and we also ordered the classical and sera melon margaritas with tequila. All got an A+.For lunch we ordered the Carnitas Prensadas, 3 pressed pork tacos with guacamole, black beans and chicharron (crunchy crumbles of fried pork crackling.) We also got the Enchiladas Suizas that came with 3 enchiladas made of pulled chicken, a delicious Chile poblano cream sauce, salsa verde, onions, and melted cheese. The last dish was tacos de camaron con tortilla de lechuga, shorthand being shrimp tacos. The shrimp was spiced up with tamarind and chipotle, mixed with pickled cucumber and carrot slivers, atop jasmine rice and on a Bibb lettuce wrap. The surprising little twists on each dish left us all delighted. Parking was easy, and Wynwood Walls is so close and an easy walk to. We decided that Bakan has it all...great location, great drinks, great food, great service and great atmosphere."

      "In A Nutshell:-Tran An was a real pleasant surprise while satisfying my Vietnamese cravings in the 305.-I am very glad there many more options for Vietnamese food in Miami, it's definitely grown over the past 20 years.-This spot is very stylish in interior design (check out my pics).-The food is a bit pricey, but trust me the food here is worth the price especially if you are trying to please your palate.-The Lemongrass Beef Stew Noodle has that authentic taste you are looking for w/ the perfect amount of noodles (you can add more noodles too), the beef pieces were very tasty & plentiful too - a true winner.-The Vietnamese Chicken Slaw is for those seeking a carb-free option but still making your mouth water w/ the winning combination of fish sauce + sugar plus shredded cabbage, herbs & morsels of chicken.-To order, it's self serve so order at the front of the restaurant & your food will be brought out to your table.-There is also a cool little walk up window on the outside of the restaurant if you want to grab & go.Overall, this is a very good Vietnamese restaurant, P.S. make sure you use their interesting bathroom, it's like a mini-club w/ cool heo (pig) toilet paper holder :)",
      "First time here.  This is a Pretty good spot. solid service with a smile.       Drawback...parking is not free.",
      "Such a good place to stop if you're in the Upper East Side/Little River area. This place is pho real.This is definitely more of a takeout spot, we saw deliveries going out constantly, but the service and the decor inside is worth eating in. It's decked out in mid century glam red, definitely pho-to worthy :)To the food! I got the Vermicelli bowl ($9.5) and OG bbq pork ($7), it was delicious. My only wish was for a slightly bigger portion but no complaints on taste :)",
      "Came for dinner here one day and was surprised at how cute and cozy the inside was! They also offer outside seating with an umbrella which is nice. It's a very laid back vibe with a retro looking theme. As for the food, I wouldn't say this place is authentic or the best Vietnamese food I ever had. It got the job done and the employees were nice. The food does look good but the taste just wasn't there for me or the person I came with. In fact they said that the pieces of meat they had were a bit too burned and tasted bitter.Also it is good to note that you have to pay for parking and they add a 15% automatic tip to your bill. I didn't see a sign stating this so I'm glad I asked for my receipt. Overall, pretty average food. Glad I tried it but probably wouldn't return. Two stars for the cute ambiance and nice employees.",
      "def a good decision . I was in the area and looking for a quick bite... was torn btwn here and taco place next door .. after seeing the menu decided on Tran an.I ordered the chicken slaw and the pork/shrimp rolls.The chicken slaw was super fresh and had great flavor, The rolls i liked a lot too.. only comment was that they were a little oily so if you're concerned about that they have plenty of nonfried options..Although The chicken slaw is considered a small plate (and in contrast to some other reviews) I found it to be plenty of food for one person and was def filled by the time i got o the spring rolls.",
      "Worth the drive . Came from boca raton to try it out and what an experience. I can't wait to bring my kids and family here !",
      "A for effort. The area is super cute with plenty of bites near by. I'm glad that there's more south east asian representation but the flavors here are catered to the American tastebuds and price point. I ordered the hot noodle bowl with chicken. It was pho noodles with grilled chicken, pickled bean sprouts, scallions, and onions. Overall the chicken was juicy but kinda bland.The broth that it came with was a pho broth on the side which I love, normally. It is reminiscent of hieu tieu but the broth was salty and did not have a lot of pho flavors.They had dessert there which were good but soooo overpriced. I love the coconut flavors in the dessert and it was perfectly sweet.",
      "Tran An offers food that is \"inspired by the richness of culture and the bonds of family.\" And you feel this cool homey vibe there, like your funky auntie and uncle who disco dances on the weekend. The decor is the best and the menu has classics like pho, banh mi, and salads with shareable dishes like spring rolls.I'm been lots of times, but today I made it in for their Happy Hour 1/2 off Banh Mi and ate outside at the picnic table.  I got the Jackfruit Banh Mi and Chrysanthemum tea in a can. I added Hoisin and sriracha because I'm a saucy loving lady, but it was good on its own (though a little on the greasy side for some reason). Staff had the best vibes and I'm sure glad I came.",
      "My very first time coming to the actual Tran An. I had tried it before but at their small location inside the Mia Market in Design District but its main location is so cute! I was there Wednesday, and I didn't even know it was Wednesday of half off in wine! Meaning a glass of white wine was $7! We started with the Vegan Spring Rolls which are not fried but there were full of delicious veggies, similar to a Summer Roll. Then we ordered the Chicken Pho and the Vegan Pho. I mainly ate the Vegan Pho and the broth was delicious and so refreshing to be a soup. Also, I had never been so into dry mushrooms but these ones were really good and the noodles were amazing! My friend had the chicken one and said the taste was good. Now, if you don't like onions, or are not a fan of it, I'll recommend just not to have it because it's raw onions and the taste is pretty strong and it's a pretty good amount of it as a topping on the soup. They have some sauces on the table, and the mix of the siracha with the broth and lime is so good! Service was ok, a little bit confusing when we arrived. We asked how we could place an order and the guy who was there told us to sit anywhere and gave us the menu. He brought us utensils and everything we needed to eat but didn't mention we had to place the order directly on the iPad right by the entrance so we were just waiting there for the server until we heard another server telling the table next to us to place the order there. Overall food was good, they had everyday specials for the month of November and you will definitely be leaving smelling like onions but the food is pretty good so doesn't bother me.",
      "I've had this spot bookmarked for some time now but also never noticed that I pass by it fairly often when I work in Miami. Today, I was craving a Banh Mi so I decided to stop by.Tran An is kind of hidden so you don't really see it off of NE 82nd Street. There is a cute and spacious patio area for outdoor seating. The indoor seating is limited and a little smaller in space but totally cute decor. You walk up to the window from the patio area to place your order or go inside and order from same counter area. I ordered the Super Deluxe Banh Mi with roasted pork, lemongrass sausage and OG BBQ pork. All Banh Mi's are served on a French baguette with pate, Maggi butter, pickled slaw and herbs. I also ordered an ube milk coffee. I snagged a mangosteen can drink for later because I have never seen this can drink before and mangosteen is a fruit I enjoyed from my childhood.I stopped into the bathroom because the painting on the wall inside that caught my attention, \"Mom, you were were right (ANOUT EVERYTHING)\". Haha. I also noticed a cool rose gold pig with sunglasses holding the toilet paper. The bathroom is cute.I sat down at a small booth for two and waited for my food. The menus are displayed in an old school photo album and included photos of the food items and also old family photos of a Vietnamese family, I'm guessing these photos may be the owners? Unique presentation. I loved the family photos for authenticity. My drinks were dropped off to my table first, then my Banh Mi. My ube milk coffee was meh. I had a superb ube Vietnamese coffee with boba at a new spot in town, Jade Tea House. Now that was AMAZING!!! Sorry but this drink in comparison didn't impress me. It was only $3.50 so it's all good. My Banh Mi was delivered pretty quickly, I thought it was weird they served the bread wrapped in an ugly foil wrap. Why mess up a beautiful Banh Mi with this presentation? The Banh Mi is as tasty. The meats had lots of flavor. But the bread was lacking in that authentic Vietnamese baguette with the crunchy exterior and super soft interior. After unwrapping the paper off my Banh Mi, my bread was wet and soggy. Still a tasty Banh Mi but man, you have to have that crunchy baguette.I'd like to come back and sit on the patio and try a few of their other dishes. The menu prices were fair. Not too cheap and not too pricey, even being located in Miami.I love the decor. Please consider serving your Banh Mi's without that ugly foil wrapping, it really just kills the presentation. Maybe consider a cool wrapper or none at all. I'm not a fan of the soggy Banh Mi."

      "Yikes!  You would think that by seeing how busy this restaurant was it meant the food was great, but that's not true!  The service was questionable throughout the night so I'll spare sharing the ñame of the waiter, it seemed they might have been handling more tables than they could.The main culprit is the chef or cooks or lack there of.  It's as if escaped chimps were handed playdooh to microwave and throw things on metal plates and someone called it charming.Presentation?  Charm? Spirit?  Not hete.  Who cares it's a córner spot in Coral Gables we can get away with anything; was that the business model used here?The  tortilla appetizer was under cooked, basically raw and the small section that was cooked tasted terrible.  The staple of Spaniard food killed.  Where to go from here...The stuffed dates with chorizo, or whatever it was suppose to be, was indecipherable.  It's so dark, what was it I ordered again?It gets worse, the Truffle Carbonara was Mushy pasta which looked and tasted as if it came straight from a dog food can.  A boiled egg on top with some other white thing on top, are we attempting to be hip?  Thank god we stopped ordering... cause everything is over priced because well, why not?  Don't let your eyes decieve you, just everything you Love about Spain is not here!",

      "Delicious food! This was my first time getting tapas, and I had a blast! I tried so many delectable dishes throughout the night. I highly recommend the Montaditos and the pork skewers with the green and yogurt sauces (I can't recall the name of this dish)--these were my favorite dishes of the night. And the churros were fantastic! I would not recommend patatas bravas, though; they're rather heavy and not as flavorful as some of the other dishes.The service was excellent; the staff were attentive and welcoming throughout the evening despite the fact that we came in just thirty minutes before closing. Our server guided us through the menu and ensured that we picked dishes that we would enjoy; she was just lovely!The restaurant is quite lively. There's a bar, outdoor seating, and plenty of space inside to eat. The prices are reasonable.A great place to dine with friends and family.",
      "First time coming to the gables location, yay! I recently tried Bulla for the first time a couple of weeks ago (can't believe it took me that long... I know) and was left craving their delicious 'tapas'. So, naturally, my Bulla-loving friend and I took a trip here and ordered lots of bites to try. 6:00pm on a Sunday w/ no reservations, which there was no need for at that time. However, the restaurant got pretty packed a mere 45 min later. The waitress was kind, as always, and took our order. Food came out in rapid speed (bonus points!!) and was delicious as always. Bulla is a staple, 10/10 recommend!",
      "I was hunting for a great Cubano Sandwich and @Bulla's was top in my search. Ended up here after walking Miracle Mile and seeing all the stellar reviews on Yelp (thanks to my fellow Yelpers!) truth be told,NOTE: on the weekends, you can only get the brunch menu!  No open tables (reservations are strongly recommended!)The bummer? No Cubano sammie on the brunch menu.  My guest and I we split several tapas and a dessert...all of which were outstanding in taste and left us very satisfied. The pan con tomato is a baguette cut in half and seriously plenty for 4- 2 of us  split it which only meant we each had more rich tomatoes garlic bread appetizer to enjoy.The extra large garlic shrimp were flavorful and chock full of garlic.  Really incredible. No vampires followed me home.My guest had the salmon salad with two hunks of salmon atop spinach and chickpeas covered with a lemon cream sauce.  There's no photo, as it wasn't in the same queue as our tapas, and we were hungry! But it was served on a long rectangular tapas plate versus a bowl or dinner plate.I wasn't too disappointed by the brunch only menu once I learned of the bottomless mimosas or sangrias that were available.  What a pleasant surprise before a tailgating party.We sat at the bar, full service, and chatted with some of the locals to get recommendations as we ogled their food. Prices were a little steep, post Covid, where I sent $50-60 for 3 tapas, one bottomless sangria and a desert. Will I come back? Heck ya!  Lots of other small plates to try, plenty of options for sharing and I Still wanna try the highly recommended cubano sammie!!",
      "Being a huge fan of the Bulla location in Atlanta, when it popped up on a search for lunch spots on our recent visit to Coral Gables, we made a b-line down Ponce De Leon immediately! There were 5 of us for lunch and we arrived around 11:45 AM and did not have a wait or issue being sat. We started with a couple orders of the Pan Con Tomate, which is easily one of the most basic, yet complex dishes ever...and tastiest! For lunch, you can order off the main menu which features a spread of tapas, salads, sandwiches and mains, or you can go Prix Fixe in a 2 or 3 course option. Most of us went two course Prix Fixe with an appetizer and sandwich. I went Lentil/Chorizo soup and Cuban with patatas bravas...classic, delicious and filling! A few other favorites from the table were the Croquetas de Jamon, Bulla Burger, Carpaccio de Salmon and the Kale Caesar. Service was stellar. Our waitress was friendly, energetic, positive, welcoming and helpful! We legit thought about trying to recruit her to our nearby hotel...Overall, excellent visit to a brand that I adore! When back in town, Bulla will be on the lunch list for sure!",
      "Went for Miami Spice lunch with the family and it was a hit for everyone (even with various allergies, dietary restrictions, and flavor profile preferences). We share the pan con tomate. 3 of us did the Miami Spice menu, and 1 ordered a La carte-- it's nice that they don't force everyone at the table to participate in Miami Spice like some restos. Great place to take people from out of town!",
      "Great Miami Spice dinner - and a pleasant surprise that they include a drink as part of the Spice menu! Tapas - we ordered the jalapeño ceviche, croquetas de jamón, and brisket montaditos. Everyone enjoyed their apps. Entrees - truffle carbonara (I was happy they could customize mine without bacon and added another protein) & arroz caldoso. Both were very good and filling (we took home leftovers!), but I wish the truffle carbonara had a stronger truffle flavor. Dessert - churros & the coconut flan, both excellent, though we weren't fond of the chocolate sauce for the churros. The dulce de leche was the preference all around. Service was pleasant though there were some issues with food coming out at different times and we almost got our dessert before the entree (not sure if it was meant for a different table or they actually thought we had already eaten dinner). All in all, very enjoyable dining experience - we will be coming back!",
      "I love this place for any meal, but especially for their bottomless brunch on Saturdays and Sundays. They offer bottomless mimosas and sangria for $19 (which is a great deal compared to other places!). They offer a 3 course pre-fix meal with popular menu items which is a great deal if you're hungry! We ordered the huevos bulla which is one of their signature dishes and they mix it up for you table side. The ham croquetas are always a big hit and it comes with a tasty fig jelly. We ordered the cochinillo hash and a cheese/serrano plate and both were great to share. I love the atmosphere here - it is a good vibe for just 2 people and also for a big group! The bar is nice to sit at casually and they also have a round table to seat 6! I come here frequently and will keep coming back and bring friends and family!",

Well-prepared delectable plates with great presentations and flavors.The service was my favorite and that says alot since the food was high quality! We were a party of 4 and 2 of us arrived early- we waited for the other couple at the bar. While we were seated at the bar waiting for our drinks we noticed two gentlemen standing by the bar and were asking the bartender if anyone was leaving soon. the bartender told him as of now it looks like all seats are full and thats when my bf and i offered up our seats as we were just waiting for the other couple and didnt mind standing in the meantime. The bartender gave us a complimentary drink as a thank you which was also very sweet of him. As we got seated the waiter made sure to describe any dish we had questions on in great detail. He knew all the ingredients and assured us on our order. The quality of the food was also top tier! another nice note is that the use zak the baker bread which is a bakery near them and extremely fresh for the beef tartare.",
      "Unfortunately they are currently closed and so sad since they are an amazing restaurant. The food offerings are a bit smaller than other places but they are incredible! There isn't a bad plate in the place. We had a table of four so we shared some pairings and all enjoyed the different offerings. Personally loved their fried chicken and beef plate. Not to mention they're amazing drinks. I've had the best \"old fashioned\" that I have ever had here. Just perfect with an incredible taste. What an amazing place and never will disappoint.",

It states that all things equal, you should rather have a fat doctor than a skinny doctor because the fat doctor probably had to overcome his weight to make it in the medical profession, whereas the skinny doctor \"looks the part\" and would not have to stand out, from a competency standpoint. I only bring up the Fat Doctor Theory because, aside from the coincidental fact that some doctors in Miami may have gotten fat from the delicious food at KYU, we have a funny story from a few months ago that perfectly sums up just how insanely good KYU is. My wife and I had two friends visiting from LA -- some culinary heavy hitters, as you can imagine -- and we wanted to really impress them with the best dining experiences in Miami. Naturally, KYU was on the list for Thursday night. Unfortunately, as we were waiting for our table outside, a Hitchcokian army of palmetto bugs came out of the literal woodwork from every direction. People started freaking out! All the outdoors diners ditched their tables while the staff and a few sufficiently liquored up patrons incl. your humble correspondent took care of the invaders. (To be clear, this was not KYU's fault. The bugs are a feature of Miami's natural ecosystem, and to their credit, probably sniffed out the most delicious food in Wynwood.)So we hit a decision point: do we go somewhere else, given the weirdness of having to eat in such proximity to a recent palmetto bug invasion? Or do we stay because KYU is just that damn good?I think know you where this is going, and the other reviews available to you on Yelp will guide you on what to eat and drink. Enjoy.(Alright fine, if you feel betrayed for having read this entire review, get multiple of the tuna crispy rice and make sure to get the pork belly and brisket. They make some awesome spicy and low-sugar cocktails, too.)",
      "Service was impeccable. We were able to walk in on a Saturday at noon with no reservation. We ordered corn as a side and beef tenderloin. Both items were amazing. Every bite was filled with flavor. The tenderloin was cooked to perfection.",
      "I love Kyu! Never a bad time here. My friend & I stopped in after a boozy brunch recently for 1 more drink & ended up ordering an app, too. Our bartenders Fiona & Carlos were great in helping us make our choices: MEZ-CAL-ON-IT(Shishito pepper-infused Mezcal Momento Verde, Cocchi Americano & Dolin Blanch Vermouth) and the HAMACHI CRISPY RICE with wasabi. So good & the perfect snack & cocktail combo to close out a Sunday Funday! Def need to cone back again soon for a full meal!",
      "Visited a few weeks back with some friends and it was nothing short of spectacular! While I don't eat meat or poultry (only seafood) we were able to order a huge variety of small plates for everyone to enjoy! We ordered the burrata (delicious with the zesty yuzu marmalade), the shishito peppers, pork belly buns (i love piggies too much to eat them), the roasted cauliflower, tuna tataki, hamachi tartare, Thai fried rice in the stone pot, red snapper, grilled mushrooms and grilled corn. Everything was delicious and beautifully presented. The service was wonderful, the space modern and inviting and the ambiance was great. looking forward to visiting again soon!",
      "I came here as a solo diner and that was a mistake. Not so much that they treat you poorly but that the portions here tend to be large. I went for the tasting expecting small dishes but sadly no one warned me that they don't really scale portions here. The soft shell crab bao was amazing. And that's the type of thing they do scale, 1 bun vs 2 buns depending on your party. But then they have the crispy kale, cauliflower, and fried rice stone pot that are the same size for one as it is for many. Great value but absolutely too much food. That said, I wished I could've eaten more of the Thai fried rice or kale, they were both amazing. The decor has a bit of rustic and industrial vibe with the great small of wood burning oven. Service was overall pretty good except I do think that a good waitstaff would've warned me about the quantity during my ordering. Overall I'll come back. Either with friends or minus the tasting menu.",
      "Amazing asian fusion in Wynwood, the cauliflower, the best!Increíble fusión asiática en Wynwood, la coliflor, el mejor!",
      "Gutter 10 meter TL;DR: we do not recommend the tasting menu at KYU.Longer version: we arrived at 7:20PM for a 7:30PM and were promptly seated. I we had a day on a boat and snorkeling without lunch so we were quite hungry. That's when we spotted the tasting menu. This was our second time at KYU, and we have a first good experience. So we decided to take it.The first disappointment came from the fact that it's not really a tasting menu. They serve you the same items that are on the menu, in the same quantity. Needless to say, it is waaay too much food. It was 9 dishes.The second disappointment came with service time. We spent over 2 hours at the restaurant as the timing between some dishes was super long.Our expectation for a tasting menu is a number of small portion meal that can tell a story or show the different strengths of the chef. Always a plus when the food is well presented. A selection of items that we could have picked on the menu isn't.Food was still excellent, but we would not do it again.",
      "Oh woaw. That is the best food I have had in Florida so far. We initially came on a Saturday night without reservations, unsurprisingly they were fully booked and we could not be seated. The indoor volume was so loud anyway that I would not have enjoyed it.We booked on a Tuesday evening, it was much less busy, still a bit loud to my taste but I guess that's the Wynwood vibe?!We see promptly seated and started with cocktails. I got a SPICY SHISO SOUR which was excellent, my partner got a mocktail, the YUZ-OOLONG WAY FROM HOME and said that was the best mocktail she ever had. All the food we ordered was delicious. Modern and well executed. They work with different texture, temperature and all the ingredient were fabulous. We really had a blast.Small feedback to the waiters, please speak a bit slowly and perhaps loudly (because of music), I did not get most of the explanations that were provided when they were serving. At this point it's even better not to say anything.‍ Our waiter was super nice and attentive. Very good service! We had a great experience, I will definitely come back and bring my vegetarians friends as they had a great selection!",
      "Definitely a treat yourself for me - i tried the lunch chef tasting menu. Honestly everything was so good - the fried kale was my least favorite, tried the fried chicken, tuna, rice, and the coconut cake YUM. So much food. $137 later. Worth it!",
      "Fantastic service! We had a reservation at 8:15 but we we're running late from a previous appt and had to keep pushing and pushing. Came at 9pm and they were very accommodating and sat us right away! The servers were all great and Collin gave us some great recommendations that we ended up going with. This place is great for sharing meals! For three of us we started with the burrata which they told us how to eat it properly: mix and spread. Very good! We then shared the tuna tataki and hamachi crispy rice. I loved the tuna tataki! Sooo good and flavorful. We then shared the short rib which was extremely moist and just melted. We also shared the corn, sorry forgot to take a picture! Corn was good, wish it was off the cob to make it easier and cleaner to eat. Overall really great time at Kyu! Recommend you checking it out."

      "This restaurant has delicious food and cocktails, and a sexy vibe. The service met the caliber of the restaurant. I recently went for dinner and then lunch the next day. Yes, it was that good. I haven't been to Zuma in years and realize that I've been missing out. Although this is a pricy restaurant , there is a reasonable, lunch time special in which you can pick a few items for a set price. (I wish I took a picture of the menu, but you can probably find it on their website.)There is indoor, outdoor, and bar seating. I prefer the outdoor or bar seating. The outdoor seating is on the water, and you watch the yachts float by. And the bar seating is perfect for people watching. With the indoor seating, I felt like we were uncomfortably close to the next tables. If you're planning to drive to zuma, plan to valet. There is a dress code, so I'll plan to dress nice. All and all, this restaurant is a gem, and I I highly recommend it, especially for special occasions.",
      "The staff is definitely five stars because of the attire I was wearing, if you plan on sitting inside, please don't come in any athletic clothing unless you're Drake. They have recently updated their lunch menu in which I love for about 40 bucks. You can have a decent lunchI give this four stars because my waiter didn't want to get my valet validated Besides that everything was fine Side note, one of my entree came super last min",
      "Delicious food. Amazing scenery. Gorgeous guest. Worst service EVER! How dare a place charge hundreds of dollars per person to eat and take 20+ minutes before taking a drink order, another 25 minutes to actually serve our first cocktail and come to our table only occasionally to check up on us as various courses are served. Then also Olave our wine several tables away so we cannot serve ourselves, but not come around often enough to fill our glasses. Seriously. Skip it. I've dined here more than a dozen times over the years and the service has always been awful. There is absolutely no excuse. Shame on them!",
      "One of the best tofu dishes ever!  Ambiance was everything.  Beautiful view near the water, mini fireplaces surrounding the deck... it was chilly so the waiter brought me a cozy blanket.  Perfect for a romantic date night.  Gorgeous bar and great service.  Several vegan options on the menu.  A little overpriced but the cost was reflected in the attentive service.",
      "Zuma is located right by the water. It's modern and beautifully decorated.The service was excellent. We had a large group and ordered the pre-fixEd sampler. Some of the earlier reviews about a lack of gluten free options worried me since we had a few in our party who have celiac. However, I was pleasantly surprised that they not only had gluten free soy sauce but also brought out separate plates when needed and/or left the sauces on the side. The portions were large enough that everyone got to try each item. The steak and the sashimi were the favorites.I would definitely recommend and look forward to trying it again in the future.",

It's more of a healthy place to get breakfast, lunch, or dinner.I normally get enchiladas with mole or ranchero sauce and they only had suizas on the menu but I decided to try it out. I'm also vegetarian and they were able to substitute the chicken with black beans.The enchiladas were great, the sauce had a bit of a kick to it which I enjoyed it. I would be back to try some of their other items they offer. Like everything else in Brickell, parking to me is a hassle and everything is overpriced but that's expected in Brickell.",
      "Delicious food very quick service Quite loud inside Highly recommended Good for Sunday brunch",
      "Brunch was pretty average but service was good. I wouldn't recommend this place for a big group or even for a small one since the noise is too overwhelming to have a conversation. The tuna salad was good and the açaí bowl was very fresh. Other than that, I wouldn't recommend coming here. Pretty forgettable. You have to order and pay at the counter; yet, you are expected to tip at least 15%.",
      "Ojo de agua is one of the first brunch places I tried after moving to Miami and it's become a staple. It gets quite busy on the weekends but the service is still impressively fast! My go-to order is the chilaquiles with both salsas and the mango coconut juice. I have not been disappointed by anything on the menu and each juice and dish I try makes me love ojo de agua just a little bit more.",
      "So amazed on how fast service was here! Food literally took 2 minutes to get to our table!!The food was amazing. Really fresh and the presentation is beautiful. I had the chilaquiles with chicken and they were fire.Their juices are also really good- had the strawberry one and it was delicious",

      "This place has great tacos but it is very over priced which is why I am not giving 5 stars. The ambience of the restaurant is very cute and makes this place good for lunch. The restaurant can get so over crowded at times that there isn't even a place to sit after ordering your food at the front.",

Incredible. - Tiramisu OMG - get it. - Tableside Caesar - Very nice server - Ben - Foccacia bread The good: - Meatball App - The wine cellar and steak presentation as you walk in is a nice touch General feedback: - Dimming the lights a bit more would give it some real ambiance and a homier feel  - They JUST opened so cut the staff some slack. I've been on a team opening a restaurant before and it's so hard. They did great! - Good location - easy access with ample parking. A local steakhouse is just what the neighborhood needs - The staff was really sweet and everyone was really working hard all night.",

They have a great menu with all sorts of selections.  Our waiter was pushy and rude.  We ordered a NY Strip, Branzino, Pasta Bolonaize, Filet Minan, truffle fries and salad.  The steaks were ordered medium well done.  All the food was good except the steaks.  They kept bringing back the steaks rare and the waiter was angry with nasty comments toward us.  If you go here avoid this guy.  We told the mgr who seemed surprised.",

      "Hello my name is Nick. Of course I'm from New York. I usually don't write reviews specially bad ones we got to this nice restaurant very gorgeous inside. The bread was delicious. I have to say the first course was a pasta dish we split. It had a Bolognese sauce on it it was served hot and good. Little did I know that was the highlight of a dinner. My steak came out first they cut it up which I wasn't crazy about but it was cold. my friends ordered a veal dish a special order. They accommodated them but the dish also was ice cold. The dish presentation was very nice but it being cold was definitely a problem. I must mention the sides to twice cook baked potato was a baked potato not twice cooked. The cream spinach was nice fresh baby spinach sautéed with melted cheese on top. The menu, said cream of spinach. I do wish they would get their act together, and I would even consider trying it again. The Decour is very elegant. It was Christmas Eve. We got there at 6:15 and it wasn't that busy. There was no excuse for the cold food. I must say I was very disappointed. My name is nick hogan.",

If you don't right you can catch the live music as the sun sets, and the restaurant transforms to a lounge. Totally worth coming Parking is tricky, and if you're not paying attention you might miss it as you drive by. But it's a gem worth coming back to.",
      "Seaspice is known to Miami locals as a very high end resturant, frequented by celebrities.  I have no idea why.  The service is pretty awful.  The drink runners are horrible.  It takes about 30 minutes for just a drink to be brought out to you.  The food is mediocre.  It is definitely NOT worth the price, which is very expensive.  I am giving two stars because the view is amazing.  Seaspice is right on the water and has a gorgeous ambiance.  You can watch yachts drive by and some will even pull up and park.  The other star is for the tres leches.  This dessert was AMAZING, I would go back just to eat it again.  But otherwise, Seaspice is nothing special.  Save your money.",
      "A place that tries to be high end but fails to deliver.Service ? Mediocre Food ? Below parFirst thing when you check in is they tell you that you have a 2 hr max(tacky)",
      "I read this was one of the best patio dining AND a hot spot for celebrities in Miami, so I had to go check it out on our recent travels to this area...Initially I was worried about our luggage situation, as we had to carry our luggage to the restaurant since this was our last stop in Miami. However, they were very accommodating, and let us store some of our stuff in the closet, and we kept the big luggage with us, near our table.As expected, the patio scene was spectacular...city skyline and seaside views, with plenty of yachts passing by! The place indeed had that chic celebrity vibe...truly FAB! Loved the music overhead as well. Somehow, I expected some snobbiness...but not at all. Service was great!Then the food. OMFG...I've had some amazing foods lately, but this takes the cake. Even the complimentary bread was amazing (and unique)! My husband ordered this Wagyu Burger, and I chose this Ragu Pappardelle ( THE best Ragu Pappardelle I've ever had...EVER. ). Then this Pavola dessert...again, just beyond delish. Truly, this was foods for the celebrities.Honestly, I'm shocked at how low the rating is for this place. I assume that if the service isn't top notch, it would probably piss some folks off. The pricing was on the outlandish side...with even lunch entrees starting at around 40. There was even an appetizer item priced at around 70 bucks! Luckily, like I said, I felt that the foods and the service (and especially the spectacular ambiance) made up for it. There was this big yacht parked right near us, which somewhat blocked some of the views from the left. Still, we got our eyeful of seaside/yachtside views.In any case, this was a great way to end our trip in Miami.",
      "Went here with a group of girlfriends for brunch and everything was delicious, they were super accommodating as well.I had the froze , a cucumber and gin cocktail and 2 grey goose and sodas and all were fantastic.As a table we split the fresh fish and a couple sides and it was delicious. Also love the free bread It is definitely on the pricier side overall tbh but great for a fun \"fancy\" brunch",
      "Came here for Miami spice and although we spent more than we thought we would, we had a good time. Everything was delicious. The kale Caesar had pecans and Granny Smith apple slices, never had a Caesar like this but it was a nice change! The Shrimp Pesto Whole Wheat Spaghetti was my favorite, even though I'm not the biggest fan of pesto. The burger was good too just a little messy from the truffle aioli. The chocolate cremoso and tres leches was very good but I'd go with the cremoso for the cocoa nib crumble, yum! All in all, I think it's overpriced and I probably won't come here again because of that. The cheapest bottle of Chardonnay was $75 and most drinks were $20. I only came here for Miami spice and still spent almost $200.",
      "Given we still have Miami Spice going on until the end of the month we decided to try out the lunch menu @ Seaspice gorgeous location on the Miami River, sitting outdoor is really relaxing, so beautiful to watch the boats go by, really lovely To start we had the Comte' Cheese Soufflé, I have to admit this was a bit disappointing, it really did not have the texture of a real soufflé  but then............ the Shrimp Pesto Whole Wheat Spaghetti and the Pan-Seared Chilean Seabass were really good as dessert, both the Tres Leches and the Chocolate Cremoso were yummy Try it out before Miami Spice ends, you can check out the Miami Spice Menus on miamiandthebeaches.com@seaspicemia",
      "First time for me at Seaspice, it is located on the banks of the Miami River it is a gem that you should not miss. Sit outside in the courtyard enjoy your food and a drinks while watching the boats go by, just beautiful We had the Miami Spice lunch which has a very affordable fix price 3 course menu for $ 28, unfortunately this will end soon, nevertheless, I would defiantly go back again for sureRegarding the Miami Spice menu only one observation, they should have had more than one choice for the Entrees without the extra charge, right now you have 4 choices and 3 of these have extra charge on it, not really fair given that you are promoting the Spice menu, you should have at least two or three choices included in the price and one or two with the extra charge We had had Prince Edward Island Mussels, Grilled, the Grilled Faroe Island Salmon and the Profiteroles and Peaches and Cream. My favorite where the Mussels, the garlic pizza bread they brought for the table was absolutely delicious, the Salmon was good too. I had the Peaches for dessert and it was ok, not really my thing, my friend said the Profiteroles were great, next time I will not opt for the healthy dessert We enjoyed all with a good Albariño wine, our experience was made especially enjoyable by our waiter Fabrizio, he was really great ! Thank you Fabrizio @seaspicemia",
      "Bad first impression. Its not a nice feeling to feel like you have to beg to spend your money at a restaurant. Every year I look forward to Miami Spice. It's a great way to try out various restaurants and a unique spread of menu options. Seaspice was on my radar and happened to be one of the participating restaurants offering the Miami Spice menu. I contacted the restaurant in advance and made a reservation for 3:30p for a party of four. My mom who is from out of town was excited to join us for lunch. I advised the restaurant we were doing the Miami Spice menu. The restaurant made it clear that they charge $50pp for No Shows. At 3:15pm, we arrived for our reservation. The hostess Karin greeted us, and advised us that they were running behind on the reservations and because of this they will not be able to offer the Miami Spice menu. Only the a la-carte menu will be offered. This was a bit upsetting because we drove almost an hour to get there and the restaurant is refusing to offer the Miami Spice promotion. Our natural instinct was to just say forget it we will go somewhere else. I mean, at the end of the day who wants to beg to spend their money? It's absurd. If the restaurant is offering a promotional menu and because to no fault of our own they are running behind why should we be penalized?My Mom looked so bummed out. Because she was so excited to try this place. I decided to walk back in and ask for a Manager. The Manager took 20min to come out. When he finally did come over, he introduced himself as Collin. I explained to him what was going on and it seemed as though he wasn't aware that the hostesses were turning Miami Spice customers away. He decided to make it right and advised Karin to honor the Miami Spice menu. Impressive! Things were turning around. Besides the encounter at the hostess stand, the restaurant is beautiful. It is situated on Miami's waterfront were you can view the million dollar yachts passing by. They also have docks for those interested in docking and dining. You can view the downtown city skyline which I am sure looks amazing at night.The food was excellent. The Miami Spice menu offered a three course lunch for $28. You have the choice of a starter (Kale Salad, Cheese Souffle, or White Gazpacho). A choice of entrees (Seabass, Chicken Breast, Shrimp Pesto Pasta, Wagyu Burger, or Plant Bowl). And a choice of dessert (Tres Leches or Chocolate Cremoso). They also offer the option to add a Glass of wine for and additional $12. I ordered the Comte Cheese Souffle, the Green Circle Farms Chicken Breast, and the Tres Leches. The others in my party ordered the Kale Salad, Gazpacho, and Seabass. For starters, My favorites were the Kale Caesar Salad and Cheese Souffle. The Kale Caesar had a mix of shredded Granny Smith apples, pecans and a creamy Caesar dressing. The cheese Souffle was like a fluffy egg Souffle with a cream parmesan sauce and tomato chutney. Delicious!For entrees, both the Seabass and Chicken breast were amazing. The Chicken breast was tender and juicy, served on top of a creamy polenta and topped with corn, peas, and mushrooms. The seabass was seared nicely to give a nice crunch on the outside, while perfectly flaky and moist on the inside. It was served with stewed garbanzo, Swiss chard, and smoked potato. For desserts, we all had Tres Leches. It was served in a small Mason jar topped with 3 milks, and berries. Perfect way to end the meal. The portions are not large but it is filling. The flavors are fresh and very well balanced. The food presentation was notable. The Watermelon Tequila drink was delightful and refreshing. The froze was also a big hit. The cocktails were presented well and created perfectly. We enjoyed everything. Our waiter, Austin was very friendly. He made great recommendations and was very attentive.An 18% gratuity was added to the tab. There are lots of street parking accessible. In the end, the food was great. Ambience was amazing. The hostesses can use additional customer service training and learn to use better judgment to improve the customers experience. There was no need to escalate the matters to a manager. It could have been handled properly by showing empathy, apologizing, and finding a solution to the problem.",

With a security right next to our table my phone STILLL got stolen. It was on the table. And to whoever has the time to steal phones is just sad imagine what else they can steal... I wil ask to review cameras but with the way I was treated when I let them know I lost my phone I doubt they will be helpful but I'll let every platform form of review know that they steal phones here. I know the exact time frame as well so they wouldn't even have to look much at the cameras. Let's see. BTW I BEEN HOME SICK AFTER EATING THESE OYSTERS I COULDNT Even celebrate my baby's birthday w him.",
      "Came here for my birthday dinner with my boyfriend for a 7:15 reservation (we called in advance for an outdoor seat dock side) we waited about ten minutes after our arrival for our table to be ready at the bar, the short wait was definitely worth it. Started with an aperol spritz at the bar then ordered octopus and gazpacho to start. Octopus portion was good but the olive oil tasted burnt since it came out on a sizzling hot cast iron looking skillet (its very easy to overcook octopus, please just bring a regular plate next time.) I also had the whole main lobster. Extremely delicious large portion of perfectly cooked and seasoned lobster, bravo. My boyfriend had the truffle coated Chilean sea bass and he absolutely loved it. Vibe: 5/5 this place definitely is a scene but not overwhelmingly pretentious or obnoxious. Absolutely loved the music as well. Service:3/5 A bit slow, our server was very attentive when we were able to get his attention but we had to always wave him down. Food: 4/5 everything was honestly pretty good (octopus could've had a bit more attention to detail)",
      "Hi Liz,Thank you for celebrating your birthday with us!  We are so happy to hear you had a great experience and enjoyed the food.  Your feedback regarding the octopus has been sent to our chef. We look forward to seeing you again soon!"

      "Overall: Amazing food. We will definitely be back! The Great: - Biscetta allá Fiorantina. We got the serving for 2. Incredible. - Tiramisu OMG - get it. - Tableside Caesar - Very nice server - Ben - Foccacia bread The good: - Meatball App - The wine cellar and steak presentation as you walk in is a nice touch General feedback: - Dimming the lights a bit more would give it some real ambiance and a homier feel  - They JUST opened so cut the staff some slack. I've been on a team opening a restaurant before and it's so hard. They did great! - Good location - easy access with ample parking. A local steakhouse is just what the neighborhood needs - The staff was really sweet and everyone was really working hard all night.",
      "Went here for a birthday dinner. They have a great menu with all sorts of selections.  Our waiter was pushy and rude.  We ordered a NY Strip, Branzino, Pasta Bolonaize, Filet Minan, truffle fries and salad.  The steaks were ordered medium well done.  All the food was good except the steaks.  They kept bringing back the steaks rare and the waiter was angry with nasty comments toward us.  If you go here avoid this guy.  We told the mgr who seemed surprised.",
      "The staff and Marco was amazing! The food, absolutely Devine, the portion the flavor, the attention to detail were all perfection. Thank you for making my husband's 40th bday so memorable.",
      "Hello my name is Nick. Of course I'm from New York. I usually don't write reviews specially bad ones we got to this nice restaurant very gorgeous inside. The bread was delicious. I have to say the first course was a pasta dish we split. It had a Bolognese sauce on it it was served hot and good. Little did I know that was the highlight of a dinner. My steak came out first they cut it up which I wasn't crazy about but it was cold. my friends ordered a veal dish a special order. They accommodated them but the dish also was ice cold. The dish presentation was very nice but it being cold was definitely a problem. I must mention the sides to twice cook baked potato was a baked potato not twice cooked. The cream spinach was nice fresh baby spinach sautéed with melted cheese on top. The menu, said cream of spinach. I do wish they would get their act together, and I would even consider trying it again. The Decour is very elegant. It was Christmas Eve. We got there at 6:15 and it wasn't that busy. There was no excuse for the cold food. I must say I was very disappointed. My name is nick hogan.",
      "Nice bar.  Quality food.   Good service    Except bartender Angie.  Good wine and liquor selection",
      "Great new restaurant. Not crowded yet. We got frutti dimare and branzino, both dishes were excellent. I especially liked that unlike many other places they go easy on a salt. Highly recommend!",
      "Rippoff stupid place out of place Does not belong among working class neighborhood Just close down and go to Ball Harbor",
      "Ridiculous prices for a basic Italian restaurant It will never make it in NMB Will not bring lunch customers at this prices Dinner customers will go to a well known reliable restaurant",
      "My boyfriend and I had been waiting for what felt like an eternity for this place to open because we love Frank so we had to check out a place named after his iconic song. Just like his song, our experience was great! The place feels intimate and has a great ambiance for a date night. The food was also incredible! Yet, the best part was the service. Our server Andrea was so sweet and helpful the entire night. I highly recommend!",
      "One of the most authentic Italian restaurants I've ever eaten at!  First rate and class-  Look forward to having many more meals at My Way!  Thanks to the incredible staff for an incredible evening.",
      "Perfect place for date night! The food was amazing and the staff very friendly and attentive. Can not go wrong with the BURRATA CAPRESE for starter and my favorite the FILETTO DI MANZO! So many tasty options can't wait to go back next time I am in town!"

I was never without a drink and the food came out fast. The food was delicious, but it's the service experience that will bring me back. Definitely ask to be served by Jeremy for the best dining experience (plus he's also easy on the eyes )",
      "I went with a friend to celebrate her birthday and Mason, gave us great service by giving us recommendations and checking on us frequently. Thank you!",
      "I'll cut to the chase; the aesthetic is gorgeous, attention to detail is unmatched. Sexy Fish is truly a beautiful place to dine. It's a picture/selfie haven. Just be prepared because it is pricey. The food is delicious but in comparison to other high end eatery's I've been to, I'd definitely say you're mostly paying for the ambiance here. Is it worth it? Definitely for the experience, at least once. I went on a Monday night as a group of 4. We had reservations but there was about a 15 min wait to get seated. We spent those 15 mins ordering drinks at the bar. The Passion Fruit and Vanilla cocktail is perfect for all the passion fruit lovers. Its smooth and velvety from the cream soda syrup. It has vodka and sparkling wine however, the alcohol is not too overpowering. It's a well balanced cocktail. After a quick round of drinks we were taken to our table. Our waiter was great but overall the service was very slow. We found ourselves waiting longer than we thought reasonable just to order a second round of drinks and this continued throughout the entirety of our meal. On to the food; everything was tasty, super flavorful and high quality. We had the Chilean Bass w/ Ramson Miso and Black Truffle, King Crab & Bone Marrow, Truffle & Toast, Caramelized Strip Loin, Wagyu Gyoza, East Coast and West Coast Oysters and Duck Kimchi Fried Rice. Everything I ate, I'd order again. This was for sure an enjoyable meal. With all the food listed above and two cocktails each for my party of 4, the bill was about $800, gratuity included.",
      "We went there Saturday for my girlfriends birthday the food was great but they put a time limit of 2 hours. But then they offer you desert which was 80 dollars and a bottle of champagne so now you are over the two hours and they want you to move to the bar and I said no I spent 750 dollars and I'm going to have her enjoy this ocasionThey got mad Laurie the manager and a Hindu guy put security on us at the bar and threw us out Another couple complaints they bought. 4 bottles for 4000 dollars and they rushed them out to This people where on us the. Whole time you can't even talk without being interrupted that girl was the worst manager wouldn't even give me her last name I go to Barton G s and never get rushed to eat and ask to move Don't go here as soon as you get your food they push you out and then they force a 20 percent tip on you",
      "Waiting time to get your food is not short for sure! Very tasty food but very small portions.Service is great (so many people work there) and the decor is spectacular. Now the price...this is absolutely ridiculous, especially since you need to go to a burger place after to fill up an empty belly! This place will stay pretty busy for another 6 months, enough time for Miami's people to visit at least one time, but then it will fade away...",
      "First time here, beautiful restaraunt with an aquatic theme, even the restrooms are nice (weird statue of the 007 guy in the entrance of the mens restroom, but whatever)... We tried a variety of dishes: the calamari (tasty but very small dish), 6 pc sashimi (melt in your mouth,  hmmm!) a sushi roll, the best asparagus I've ever had (but very small dish), and a couple of drinks- which were in the smallest glasses I've ever seen. I don't know how our bill came out to $200, but it did. So yes, the food is yummy but served in very small portions, the service was excellent! And toyll pay a hefty penny, but we definitely enjoyed it. (I've gotta come back just to order the asparagus so i can figure out how to make it at home .)",
      "Food wasn't bad. Drinks were nothing special in my opinion, but the espresso martini had good flavor. Ambiance is nice, though it's more of a club x dinner spot. Very loud. People get on tables and dance or at least they did tonight. Seemed like a place people go to be 'seen', more to check in and be trendy rather than to enjoy a meal. Glad I went once, and wouldn't really rush back again.Service was great despite a hard to communicate venue. He made all efforts to make our experience excellent. To be fair, this is a bit too trendy for me, but a lot of other tables were having a great time.",
      "There were many hit or miss dishes, and the service was spotty as well, with some of the servers being genuinely nice, while most of them were stuck up. It seemed they lacked patience due to other tables they had but they transferred this frustration to us, which seemed unfair.The hit dishes at the table were the fish entrees, specifically the salmon. The thai donuts for dessert were good. Overall, it was just a bit underwhelming. The general feeling from our group was that its best to come here expecting more of a \"Miami\" experience, versus a \"culinary\" one. IG: @miamicheatdays for more recommendations",
      "I think this place is beautiful and some of the food was really good. Our server was good until she got a little busy then we had to wait longer to order drinks .I think it is over price. We wanted to go there because  we have seen pictures form this restaurant . When you spend as much ad we did you expect better service all the time reason why I am giving them only 3 .I think is better if you go for lunch since they have a set menu special or you seat at the bar .",
      "Me and my friends made a reservation for 7:00, we got there 11 minutes late because of traffic in Brickell and a slight hold up with Valet. When we got to the restaurant we were told that the grace period is 10 mins but they will seat us as soon as they can. We decided to sit at the bar and have a few drinks while we wait. A hour passed by and then a hour and a half... At this point I walked over to the hostess and asked if we'll be seated soon. To our surprise, she said they gave our table away because we were 11 minutes late. I explained to her that we were told that we would be seated but to give them a moment. What a mess, no apology no empathy!!! We ended up paying for our bill at the bar and leaving because we were so upset and frustrated.The only plus about this place is the ambiance and the guys behind the bar were very friendly and educated. I was very disappointed with my experience."

      "Super cute place!! It's on a corner of a busy area in midtown but I parked in a public pay parking garage for shops and walked over. It's directed with lots of florals and pillows. I saw tea sets being brought over to tables. And I saw they do afternoon tea on the menu. We were also able to make a reservation so we got seated 10 min early too. I ordered an iced lavender latte. It was pretty good. I got the eggs Benedict over crab cakes. Lots of food. Super filling and it was so good. My gripe would be the service. Super slow. I had to find out waitress to get our check and that was after waiting quite a long time. I do appreciate not feeling rushed either but we did ask the busser at first which I don't believe he ever told our server. I also saw they have a location in Weston so I'll have to try that one out too.",
      "My absolute most favorite restaurant on the planet. The first time I went to Little Hen was back in February 2022. I was in Miami for a work trip and my clients recommended Little Hen. After my first bite of Rose Pancakes, I immediately made a reservation for the next day.Make sure to go on an empty stomach, because EVERYTHING is good here. My favorites are the rose pancakes, the applewood bacon, and the chai latte. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu.Lastly - I know everyone is complaining about the wait. Yeah, this is just one of those places. Just make a reservation a day ahead and you should be good (unless it's a weekend - may need more planning time there).Again, this is my favorite restaurant in the world and I am lucky to work quite a bit in Miami so that I can frequently dine here!",
      "If you're going to come for a large group birthday, cut your cake somewhere else or don't bring your own cake. Normally a flat cake fee would cost you $35 at an establishment, however, here it will cost you $10 per person. My fee was $80 for a table of 8. Therefore, if you really want to sing, just get their dessert and save yourself some cash. The other note I would say is that the drinks are wine based.",
      "Super IG-worthy.  Which what brought us, honestly.  It's pretty.  We had an brunch reservation and we're seated promptly. The service was lacking, honestly, waitress forgot our water and seemed more concerned with us being out by the time-limit on the table than service.  All of us had crab cake, it was meh and lukewarm.  Hashbrown was cool in temp as well.  As was the tea.  Overall, I think it was a one and done visit.",
      "Little Hen is one of those IG-worthy places. They have beautiful floral decor. However, I found the food and service to be mediocre. My cousin and I had reservations for brunch. When we arrived, we chose to sit outside. I ended up ordering the rose petal pancakes with a side of bacon and a rose sangria. Everything was okay and nothing really stood out to me. However, it's a cute spot for a girl's brunch.",
      "Ambience:Coming to visit Miami, this place is super cute and very IG. It was a pink and rose theme with lots of pillows. There's lot of opportunity to take pictures whether it's outside or inside. You have to get a reservation via online and even with a reservation it was pack. Parking can be a little tricky depending on when you come. We got lucky and was able to find a parking spot on the street. But there's a garage nearby you can park.Rose pancake:3 stacks of pancake with rose petals. Super cute. Too bad we were outside so some of the rose petal flew away. You can definitely taste the rose within the first bite. It's not too much or overwhelming. They gave a specific sauce for the rose pancake. The sauce was a good touch of sweetness to add to the pancake. French toast:Probably the most crispy French toast I have ever had. It soft and moist on the inside with a nice crispy crunch on the outside. You can taste a hit of bourbon. Drinks presentation were on point! Very cute and creative.",
      "Gorgeous place for afternoon tea and brunch! Booking a reservation is highly recommended. We originally booked inside but ended up changing to outside because it was perfect weather that day! Tea and lattes, and the rose petal pancakes were divine. It was nice to see a few couples, group of ladies, parent and child, and even a couple of men dining there so it's not just for the ladies haha! At first I noticed the staff seemed snobby when we approached them about our reservation (they stared up and down at my cousin and I and proceeded to whisper to each other) but otherwise service was professional and friendly. Def one of the more popular places in Miami.",
      "A beautiful floral garden restaurant ideally situated in Miami design district offering great ambiance & pretty good food! We went there close to noon on a Friday and were told that we'd have to wait for up to an hour. They took my # and while we were across the park browsing at some shops nearby, we got paged within 15 minutes, so it wasn't too bad! All the beautiful outdoor seating was taken/reserved looong ago but we didn't mind our indoor seat because this restaurant is beautifully appointed in this French country modern chic style that just grabs your attention. Servers were all dressed to match the rose theme which was nice. We ordered Carbonara burrito and the Rose pancake. I have to say the Rose pancake looked tastier than it actually was, and my wife couldn't finish it. Carbonara burrito was recommended over chicken and waffles and such by the waitress, and while it was good, it didn't wow me much nor was it memorable - I KNEW I should've stuck with my original choice of chicken & waffles...! I wanted something substantial and protein-y, and the carbonara burrito ... was a bit too carb-y for me (prob. could've used more substantial bacon bits in there). Latte was nice and so was squeezed OJ, but overall quite pricey for what it is... but you are paying also for the decor & vibe. My wife had me play photographer for over 10 minutes, and then when I looked back, I saw legions of instagram ladies playing photographer for each other for what seemed like their entire stay, so I'll consider myself lucky. I would love to stop by again and order chicken.and.waffles. next time!",
      "Even though this place is called Little Hen, it sure was giving Big Hen energy! As soon as I approached the restaurant, a big smile came across my face! The flowers, the vibe, the singing, happy birthday! It was all so lovely. Even the music was so jazzy and relaxing. The menu included super fun and delicious brunch and breakfast items and delicious pastries. It's too bad that I am working on my summer body in the winter Lol., because I could not indulge the way that I wanted to with all the yummy pastries. But I will be back!I had the frittata and it was so fluffy and flavorful! Even the tea tasted like it was steeped in love. The service was delightful and paying was a breeze. I already cannot wait to return to the Little H en.",
      "Came for a girls day for brunch. I booked ahead of time and ended up waiting about 5 minutes for a table which wasn't bad. After being seated we did wait 25 minutes before we were greeted by our waiter, he apologized and told us that the kitchen was very busy.I skimmed over the menu and was sold on the chicken and waffles immediately. It was SO good, omg the syrup was so tasty. The chicken was cooked perfectly and the waffles were so fluffy. I also ordered a mimosa that I enjoyed. I definitely understand the hype, the restaurant is so beautiful with so many florals throughout and the decorations are nice. The food and service was amazing. Just be patient because you might have a long wait even though you have a reservation and you might have a long wait when you're seated as well."

This one was more about proximity than anything. It was right in the vicinity I was in, so I gave it a go.Don Toston has good Vaca Frita, a bit dry, I would say it's not great compared to the one I had the day before at Juana La Cubana, however it's a cute place tho, and I liked it. They recommended their churrasco, but they served me soggy old ish plantains as a side, and that put me off a tiny bit.I have to bump up to a 4 for being family owned and part of a wonderful Cuban food scene even if it's not my fave. But they have big Tostones just for trying.",

I felt the maduros were a little too soggy but other than that the service was great and the food came out quick.Over nice spot, will try to come back.",

These are not the frozen greasy tostones you get in other Cuban restaurants! 3 true statement FRESH FOODGREAT AUTHENTIC TASTE PREPARED WITH LOVE IF YOU HAVENT TRIED THEM THEN MAKE THE TIME. TO DO SO !",
      "Very excited to have eaten here, we had the chicken steak (busted de pollo) and my aunt had their churrasco which was what always recommended. Amazing. Their churrasco oil sauce I asked for seconds for my chicken. It was a classic cuban meal and the service was top notch.I have to mention their iced tea, which was Lipton but they used large bags which made the tea extra strong. If you have had iced tea at other places you know that they keep it light and thus flavorless.Highly recommended!Plus the local police were there and you know that means it was amazing."

      "I went around 8am on a Sunday, and it wasn't too busy. They also spoke a little English which was helpful. I went to El brazo Fuerte yesterday, so comparing some of the food to each other:Guavaba queso: the filling was very similar to the other, but Brazos pastry was more croissant-like which I appreciated.Queso: this was just cream cheese and lacking compared to the other pastries. I wouldn't get this again.Senorita: the layers were so much flakier, so not sure if Brazo's was just older. Girlfriend liked the custard at Brazo's more though.Quatro leches: I like the dulce de Leche at Brazo's way more, but this was still good.Ham and Spinach croquettes: the ham was so good, it was minced within the cheese like filling, and not overly salty. I'd get this again. The Spinach was tasty too but a bit too dense. The outside was not as crispy as Brazo's.",

My husband also liked the ham and cheese sandwich. I personally recommend getting the guava and cheese. The perfect combo of sweet and savory inside of a flaky, light pasty. We also got a plain guava one as well! In total, we spent less than $8. There's a little bit of free parking right along the side of the shop.",
      "One of the better breakfasts I've ever had. And it was only $5. Seriously, this should be a must when you're in Miami. I ordered the guava pastelito (pastry), huevos con jamon (eggs and ham), and a cortadito coffee. The pastry was the most fresh and flaky and spewed this sweet flavorful guava jelly. The cortado wasn't too sweet, which was a nice change from the other Cuban coffee's I've had this trip. And the ham in the eggs was delectably sweet like my grandmas on Easter. Unbelievable really. But you can't make these things up. The service was top notch too. Just authentic as it gets all around.",
      "Coming from Southern California, the only Cuban bakery I've been to before visiting Pastelmania was the ever so popular Porto's. Arrived during brunch time on a Saturday with a voracious appetite. (9/25/2021) I definitely had to try their pastries and croquetas to compare back home. Ordered pastelitos de guayaba y queso, pastelitos de guayaba, pastelitos de coco, pastelitos de espinacas, an assortment of croquetas (jamon, espinacas, bacalao), beef empanada, chicken empanada, dos cortadito, dos batido de Mango. The courteous blue eyed, blond haired lady that took our order was very patient with my limited Spanish speaking ability. The pastries were flaky and had been brushed with a sweet egg wash prior to being baked; tasted really weird and off on the spinach pastry. They also tasted like they've been made with margarine instead of high quality butter. Both empanadas fillings were bland and dry. Definitely in need of spices and/or salsa to make it taste better. The croquetas had a gummy paste texture almost like the consistency of the glue sticks used in elementary school. The worse tasting of the three croquetas was the spinach. Cortadito and batido de mango were alright.Rating: 2.75 starsPrefer Porto's over Pastelmania. Lots of better places for croquetas in Miami. We didn't finish our big box of pastries/croquetas, kinda regret ordering so much and spending $43. My Puerto Rican Uncle would have shook his head and say, \"your eyes is bigger than your stomach.\" Lesson learned.",
      "$12 for a delicious dozen of pastelitos. Got the guava and cheese, guava only, and coconut - everyone enjoyed each flavor. Was there at 9 am on a Saturday, there were already about 2 people in front of me, but I was in and out in a couple of minutes. Will definitely stop by here for pastelitos when I'm in the area. They were friendly at the counter and parking on the side street was super easy.",
      "The inspiration for \"The Beauty and and the Baker\" !?! Get there early and try the plain guava and also the coconut pastries! I had 35 minutes to spare at Miami airport and was so glad I detoured!!! Wonderful people and mouth watering flaky pastries.",
      "OK, so if you want a perfect pastelito (guava/queso), look no further.  This bakery does them to perfection.  First, the pastry itself is phenomenal.  But then when you hit the (amply filled, unlike some other places) combo of the sweet guava and slightly salty cheese, you will never forget the experience."

      "Yum!! Nothing better than some Nicaraguan food. This place always has a 30 minute line no matter what time of day so I finally went to grab a bite. The food was absolutely delish, the servings were huge and there is even a little bakery/ bodega inside where you can buy empanadas and other treats. The ambiance is more of a fast food vibe, grab and go- there is some seating but it's not ideal.*warning* the staff speaks Spanish only. I had some difficulties while placing my order and had to utilize my high school level Spanish along with google translate!! The staff was super sweet but I recommend bringing a Spanish speaking friend to assist",
      "Over hyped place. Staff is beyond RUDE here. Eye roll, rushing you, attitude and talk to you like you're not paying for your food..smh. I would tolerate it if the food was worth their BS attitude but it's NOT! Gallo pinto had hard undercooked beans, lomo relleno was ok, carne asada had a good taste to it, pollo guisado was bland and the queso frito wasn't even fried properly. Cacao taste nothing like what cacao should taste like. We try to eat at Nicaraguan restaurants whenever we go to a new city or state but none have been able to match San Francisco's Las Tinajas. They have set the standard and no one else has came close.  We had heard a lot about this place by all our in-laws and friends but SOLID PASS, food is not worth being treated so rudely. Con el modo pesado que tratan a los clientes aquí deberían de servir comida que valga la pena aguantar maltrato.",
      "Hands down, one of the best Nica \"fast food\" fritangas. You can be in and out with your order in minutes, which is one of the highlights of Pinolandia. Sometimes the carne asada can be hit or miss- I've had a few tough pieces of meat which didn't seem like they were marinated long enough-- but when the stars align and you get that perfect piece--(more likely than not) you'll be in food heaven! Their gallopinto (rice with beans) has never let me down and if you're lucky enough to arrive early in the morning for breakfast before it sells out, you're in for a real treat. The staff is awesome, they don't waste time and move the line along very quickly. You can order and sit in one of the tables but this more of a no frills take-out joint, which is greatly appreciated.",
      "This is not my go-to Fritanga, However I can't stop into MIA without getting Nicaragüense food! I had an overnight layover with a super early flight abroad and was staying near the airport. So I decided to Uber over to Little Havana to get dinner as my go-to spot is way over on Flagler!The lines close to 9pm was out the door so you k ow I was excited because it had to be good.I got a typical carne asada, Gallo pinto, fried cheese, plantain and canola salad.The flavor was on point and I sorely missed this since Tampa is lacking Nica Food...However... I was shocked the meat was a little tough. Too tough to cut with my plastic knife.5 stars for flavor but 2 stars for cheap meat not marinated long enough in naranja Agria.",
      "Although I'm a Tampanian I sometimes will (regretfully) fly out of Miami when going abroad because I found a great ticket price. In this case I skipped going home to my beloved Tampa and flew from the panhandle to Miami,  stayed overnight and took an early flight out to my other home in Pamama . When in Miami Nicaraguan food is a must...something we unfortunately lack in Tampa.Since I was staying near the airport it was only right to go to close-by Little Havana instead of going to my go-to fritanga on Flagler.I was so excited to see an all spanish-speaking cast with a line out the door! I just knew the food would be amazing!Well, it was definitely Flavorful...I don't think Nica can ever lack flavor. The Gallo pinto was on point. The carne asada however...again didn't lack flavor but it was tough as hell! I'm so used to my Nica meats being tenderized by naranja agria...I was so shocked I had to work hard to chew! In the restaurant's defense...the whole time I was there the line was out the door...and they got to everyone in line fairly quickly despite how many customers they had...and they weren't running out of items.So I'm guessing there's no time to marinate long enough for tenderization. (Did I just make up a word?)I'd come back and try on a not so busy day...if there is a such thing.",
      "When I'm Miami you must stop by here for some good Central American food. It's been a while since I've come but let me tell you the place has made an upgrade due to their business is roaring. The fried cheese this time was dry and salty, make sure to tell the server to get you fresh cheese. But everything else is great! Gray bang for your buck!",
      "The food is always amazing, they are very reasonably priced, & good portions! Honestly they might be my favorite place for eating fritanga (Nicaraguan Food) in Miami! Sometimes long lines but usually moves quickly! The food is always fresh! My only bad review is regarding a female The last time I went there I had a bad experience with one of the women servers! There was 2 female Servers & I had a gentleman right before me who asked for fresh Gallo pinto bc it was the last bit of the tray & they specifically brought out more new rice; as he was waiting she tried to take my order; I just said I would wait for the new rice as well! Really if new rice was coming out anyways why would I want the bottom of tray? Then when rice came out 1 of them took his ordered & he just casually asked for a few extra fried plantains & the girl serving him gave him a few extra ones with no problem & at no extra cost; it was just a few & he had only ordered 1 serving with rice, meat, fried plantains & 1 fried cheese); I was right behind him with the 2nd server & ordered the same exact thing as him but 2 whole servings plus 3 fried cheeses; I also asked for a few extra plantains in one of my 2 orders (just as he did) & my server literally told me she couldn't give me any extra plantains at all that I would have to order extra side order of the plantains themselves; so I ended up having to buy a side order of fried plantains & obviously had to pay extra for it! It's not a big deal but how can they just do that to a frequent customer & like at 2 AM so it's not like they were super full or running low on plantains! First i was really bothered bc I don't believe it was correct for her to tell me that right after I saw the girl before throw them in like nothing; secondly at this point I was already ordering about $40 worth of food & I really just asked for a few extra on 1 of my servings!",
      "Pinolandia, es una fritanga donde la comida es deliciosa, pero la actitud de las que sirven es nunca vista en otro lado. las malas caras y la regañada es parte de el combo, un servicio completo es gallo pinto, carne asada, maduro frito, ensalada y una regañada (putiada). Todas las que trabajan allí por la mañana se toman su juguito de Limon o naranja agria para que les dure todo el día para no sonreír.Pinolandia is a fritanga where the food is delicious, but the attitude of those who serve it is never seen anywhere else.  the bad faces and the scolding is part of the combo, a complete service is gallo pinto, bbq beef , fried sweet plantain, salad and a scolding (putiada).  All those who work there in the morning drink their little lemon or sour orange juice to last them all day so they don't smile.",
      "Este lugar mantiene la consistencia y sabor sin importar los años! Usualmente ordeno la carne asada, el gallo pinto, queso frito y plátanos maduros. Entre los mejores!",
      "This carne asada is proof GOD exists. My favorite fritanga place. Getting out of the club at 2am? Go here. Waking up at 5am to go to work and need food? Go here. This place has the best for everyone. I'm glad they are on Uber Eats as well. The amount of food they give you is enough for two, but if you are like me and need to share, order two. You dont want to end up having to fight for your food. Thats how good it is. If they ask you if you want the salad, say YES! The salad is bomb. Also, get the fried cheese. If you ordered carne asada and you didnt get the fried cheese, then you didnt order the right way. I always have mine with a little bit of coke. I try not to drink coke but if I'm going to die, it might as well be eating the right way. Salud!",
      "This is such a gem! Carne asada available 24/7? And affordable too? Count me in! It was a little intimidating to order as they take orders in Spanish but we were able to get by. There is a small convenience store inside the restaurant and I got the best horchata I've ever tasted from there. It was sooo good! Highly recommend!",
      "Not the same experience and freshness. After COVID, people lost a lot of passion. Maybe that day wasn't great or I had better. Although the steak is Amazing!Not the same experience and freshness. After COVID, people lost a lot of passion. Maybe that day wasn't great or I had better. Although the steak is Amazing!"

      "We sat at the bar and did the prefix menu. Total honesty this was our first Michelin experience. It won't be our last. Each dish was thoughtfully prepared and challenged us to look at food in a different way. Their drinks are unique and delicious too. Highly recommend.",
      "Synopsis: Delicious flavor profiles, elevated food all together, variety of delicate dishes and artfully crafted plates, but the atmosphere, staff and price makes this restaurant a place I wouldn't bother coming back to.Give yourself an extra 15 to 20 minutes to find parking in the depths of Miami Beach if you make a reservation at the stubborn seed. Shocked that they didn't have valet parking, my partner and I were sweating bullets and riddled with anxiety as we frantically searched for a place to park in time for us to not lose our hundreds of dollars worth of reservations. Luckily we found a spot and made it just in time for our reservation and were gently scooted and carefully, and nimbley led towards our tiny two-person table easily with an arms reach of the next two birds in stable. It was quite loud on the restaurant though, so you could easily have a conversation without feeling like someone was listening to you, but far from private. The wait staff was pleasant but not anything special then your average Olive garden. I expected a lot more from the layout of the restaurant, decor and staff given this is a Michelin star restaurant. Not that I think I'm going to catch COVID from my utensils being placed direct me on the table, but it just seemed like an odd thing that every time they replaced our silverware they placed it directly on the wooden table. I feel like it should have at least gone on just a simple napkin or small plate that has kept nearby.The food was delicious, some dishes stood out way more than others as blow your mind good, others were just pretty great. The timing between dishes wasn't terribly long but long enough that you noticed and we're checking your watch.Ultimately, we spent A little over $500 for two people to eat here and The food quality, service and environment just did not meet that price point. We kept thinking how we could eat several times over at some of our other favorite restaurants (Sins Gastrobar, is just as delicious for 1/3rd the price) for that price and this is what loses it one star. But, don't listen to me, I ain't no Michelin reviewer.",
      "Let me say the food is great, from presentation to flavor. Two highlights for me were the oysters with basil foam and tuna.  Where this restaurant was a let down is in the ambiance and service. For a Michelin star restaurant, I was expecting that level from all aspects. The restaurant itself is nothing to write home about with tables crammed in and little decor appeal. In many ways it feels like a fancy pub. Happy to have had the experience but it didn't live up to the hype from an overall perspective and with so many amazing restaurants in Miami, I probably wouldn't return.",
      "Amazing experience! Everything was outstanding , food presentation, flavour and all the details I found at the table like the flower bouquet on the napkin!  Lovely Details are so important this time and I do appreciate that! Me and my husband went for tasting menu but we decided to try most of their dishes... we couldn't be more happier.We shared Cacio E Pepe Crunchy Truffle Bravas Swordfish Yellowfin Tuna chawan mushi (my favourite ). For dessert we shared the olive cake (blueberries) - delicious and fresh!!!!! Really nice combination of flavours! The only low part of our diner was the service :( We spent our whole diner waiting for our bottle of wine but it's all good because we had our cocktails. Like I mentioned previously service need to be more attentive but the whole experience was worthy ! For sure we will come back and I recommend 100%.Public Parking available in the area.Dress code: casual chic",
      "Loved all the food here. Fun ambiance. My favorites were the chawanmushi, the oysters, the duck pasta, and the foie gras.",
      "Imaginative, tasty, unique, fun. Some of the words I would use to describe our experience at Jeremy Ford's Stubborn Seed. We opted for the tasting menu with wine pairing on a weeknight in August 2022. On the weekends the restaurant is only the tasting menu. If your adventurous and \"like to try everything\" this is for you.We started off with a glass of champagne, followed by a list of mostly white wines for the hot summer, and a red to pair with the red meat final course.Our eight-course menu was sectioned off into six categories, Snacks, Raw, Hot App, Seafood, Land, and Dessert.  For snacks we started off with their cacio e pepe puffs, creamy and delicious, with house made pickles, and shaved parm on top.For the first round of the raw section, we were served wonderful oysters, and clams with different flavors. For a second round of the raw section, Tuna topped with Caviar and coriander chips, and summer melons and fish (not sure which one) in a Vietnamese sauce it was delicious. While on the table. While we enjoyed the latter raw items, our server placed a bubbling cauldron of orange aromatics, which was a very interesting and fun touch.For our hot app we received the Florida Shrimp & Saffron Gnocchi Veloute. It was buttery and delicious, the shrimp was tender the gnocchi were fresh and filling, two of our guests said it was their favorite.After a delicious refreshing mango \"yolk\" palette cleanser, we were off to the Seafood and Land courses.For the seafood: A unique plate was served, as if it was folded in half, with the back half standing straight up on the table, almost like a backsplash. Flounder roulade, with a brown butter umami broth. Very good.For land we received a hearty combination of braised lamb neck medallion, a perfectly medium rare lamb loin, topped with buttery foie gras, brightened up with a mint puree, and a sous vide carrot with a scotch mango puree. My favorite of the evening. For dessert, we received toasted guava puffs topped with toasted coconut for the table along with individual roasted blueberry dessert over an olive oil cake.Weekday service was very good, I probably shouldn't have come into this meal super hungry, because the pacing felt a little slow for me and I wanted it to move along just a bit faster, although to be fair If I was a little less hungry, perhaps I wouldn't have felt that way.The food is top notch, the wine pairings were very good, the tasting menu changes quite a bit though the seasons and even months, similar proteins but different preparations, this interests me and would get be to come back to try new things.",
      "At first I was hesitant.. you know.. another Miami expensive restaurant with no reason for it.. but then... I was impressed! Little gem, definitely for acquired taste, and because of it I love it!",
      "Came here with a party for 2 recently and the food was out of this world.  We got the truffle bravas, cacio e pepe cheesy puffs, tuna, truffle chicken and the swordfish- literally everything is a MUST get. The tuna came with a separate plate that was just for the fragrance to enhance the tasting experience- literally insane. Great service and ambiance and will definitely come back.",
      "I can't wait to go back! My friend and I already had dinner when we came here but thought we'd have a drink and desert. But when we saw the menu we had to try something! Stephen behind the bar was absolutely amazing. Knew exactly what to suggest for pairing wine or which cocktail we should try! He was always there to check if we needed anything and made the whole experience even better! We had the foie gras. AMAZING! Their menu changes every so often so I'm excited to go back and try other dishes! As a desert we had the olive oil cake, I had never had that and it was very good not as sweet as usual deserts which we loved even more! Their cocktail up in smoke was very fun and tasty, must try! I believe it's only street parking.",
      "My girlfriend and I were so excited to try out what we thought would be another amazing restaurant in Miami. We booked in advance and we're ready to experience and amazing meal. Unfortunately, it didn't live up to the hype. When you pay $175 for a tasting menu, plus an additional $60 for a caviar supplement, you hope to leave satisfied. Nothing wowed us. The swordfish so was tough and the dish was so salty, that I could only force a few bites. Typically a tasting menu is coursed out, but everything came on top of each other or there was a really long lag time between dishes. We were either rushing to finish our first dish, or we were waiting and waiting for the next. I'm disappointed in the service, the quality of food, the lack of flavor and overall sad experience. This is so overpriced for what the food is. You would expect quality ingredients, delicious food and great service. However, the restaurant lacked all 3."

      "I'd recommend as a solid breakfast spot for those visiting for sure but I'd probably not return as a local. Very Instagrammy decor (insert Neón quite lights) known for calling you a bxtch throughout your visit. A bit cringey and forced at times but hey. If you're looking for a quiet breakfast, don't come here.  \"bottle girls\" prance around singing happy birthday , twerking conga lines etc. its definitely a lit hyped up breakfast. Sandwiches are solid. Drinks are sugar overload and remind me of the sugar factory. I'd prefer to get the package deals of champagne but that's more for a group setting. My chicken on the chicken & waffles had a very light airy batter which was delicious atop the more dense waffle. Nice that it came with bacon and eggs automatically as opposed to it being extra. My date got the steak and eggs which didn't look that appetizing to me. The chimichurri also didn't look that fresh",
      "Food- 3/5 Overall the food is just meh. Nothing to write home to mama about. This was my second time there and I wasn't impressed. The first time we ordered the OG sandwich and the second time we had the American naked bitch that was served with grits. That house made cheese sauce that they put on top of it was not appetizing. The cafe con leche was good. If this was a last resort it would do but you could find way better food somewhere else.Service- 3.7/5 The bitching servers do a good job of celebrating your birthday or special occasion. You will be referred to as \"Bitch\" as soon as you enter the establishment so if you don't like foul language this is not the place for you. Besides that there is nothing spectacular about the service. Ambiance- 4/5 I'll give the ambiance a 4 for the view. The DJ/music selection is good but loud. So if you're looking for a more calm and quiet place don't go here.",
      "Music volume- MAXIMUM Food quality- minimumDo not judge food by these photos, they are verrryyy old and the food items are now essentially McDonald's quality. Club music for breakfast made us laugh but was hard to chat. Took them 15 min to take our orders. We almost left, wish we did.",
      "Chose this place because of the name.  It definitely lived up to the name.  They welcomed us, good morning bitches..  what can I get you bitches and so on.  The music is super loud and upbeat.  Very cool vibe!!  The waitress are all dressed up - hooters style, but cuter!  I mean a bacon bitch sports bra, can't go wrong.  Our food was good, nothing spectacular.  The silver dollar pancakes take the show. They are super thick, light and fluffy.  Delicious!!  Prices were average for brunch or breakfast.  Definitely a place to go to at least once. Enjoy bitches!",
      "3.5* for me, husband gave it a 4.Stopped by around 10:30 am on a Sunday and was expecting to be packed but it wasn't. We were seated immediately. It is very lit even early in the morning with loud dancing music - it was definitely a vibe! My husband and I both ordered chicken and waffles. My waffle felt a little thick and more dough-y, wish it was more light and fluffy. However my husband liked his just fine. I also ordered a Miami frozen drink. It was so good, loved the two different flavors, and it had plenty of liquor - did not feel like I wasted my money at all. My husband ordered Hustle,which was a mango frozen drink. It was decent but the Miami is definitely better. Would recommend! Really enjoyed the vibe and drinks here!",
      "I've seen so many tik toks about bacon bitch so stopping here while on vacation was an absolute must. After some shopping, me and my friends stopped in for lunch. Out of the entire restaurant, it was only about four other parties at the time, so it was a pretty chill day. I ordered the burger, which I believe is on the menu as the main bitch. We also got a margarita pitcher for the table.One thing about this restaurant is that they don't do substitutes to any of their meals, so do keep that in mind. I had asked to substitute my burger for a chicken patty but wasn't allowed, but it was okay for me. even ordering fries as extra wasn't a possibility at the time. Overall we had a great time. We enjoyed our food, and they played great music that we all were Vibing to so it was a pretty good experience. Our server was also extra nice and gave us a round of shots so that was pretty nice of her :)",
      "First of all the pictures were deceiving. The host and my waitress was bomb! But the food was horrible -0/10 The host saw me spit out the eggs they were cold. I told the waiter it took 15 minutes to bring my plate back just for the bacon to be burnt and croissant to be hard. Basically they microwaved my food (‍) they charged me $16 for a sangria in a $1.25 dollar store bought glass my bill came up to $155 the only person who enjoyed the food was the bird. Whoever was cooking  that day got to be the cook since they opened  in 2017 and never had a day off. Must've been TIRED AND UNDERPAID AND SICK OF THE OWNERS BULLSHIT. I wouldn't feed this food to a homeless stray dog that got ran over by a trump supporter in a Ford F150. Oh and the drink my daughter had tasted like a bubly seltzer watered down drink. NEVER EVER AGAIN!!!",
      "Looking for a TURN UP spot... Bacon Bitch is where you need to be! If you like a lit brunch with music and drinks, this is your place. To drink we had a pitcher of the Strawberry Margarita and it was strong but tasty! They also come around for shot o'clock with shots that were really good!!! They may have been sex on the beach shots. All the servers were LIT! Service is okay but the atmosphere definitely makes up for it. The food came out in a reasonable time. I ordered the OG Main Bitch sandwich. The croissant was fresh and buttery but honestly the sandwich as a whole was just okay. The sandwich didn't have a good bacon to egg ratio. I only got two pieces of bacon on a sandwich that seemed to have a lot of eggs on it. The stuffed hash brown was really good too.",
      "Okay Totyana! Your B*tches LOVE the content & appreciates your feedback.",
      "I have been planning to come here since I booked our hotel in Miami. This is the perfect brunch spot. Every moment from when you come up the escalator to the leaving the atmosphere has a great vibe and the staff is super friendly and fun. The music is bumpin and everyone is smiling. You can tell they love working here. We orders a few cocktails, a boujee sammie, a side of ham, cheesy hash brown and Nutella French toast. Damn everything was amazing. My sammie had the best crispy bacon on it and the egg oozed just right to be messy and brought the whole sandwich together. Can't wait to come back and try more of this fun brunch place. Mady was our server and she killed it from 'Hey Bitch'. Lol, I love this place!",
      "I had seen this place for a while and decided to try with a few friends. I had such high expectations due to the places is located but nothing out of this world. The food took forever to get to out table and when it got the it was not what we expected, I could have made better breakfast at home. The decoration its cute and fun but this places is just to have a few drink."

      "My main reason for popping in this review today is to say that anyone saying Phö 79 is better should not be trusted (LOL). I imagine those diners think you'll get a better burger at McDonalds than Shake Shack or Five Guys too. I've ate at maaaany family-owned authentic Vietnamese spots between Orlando and Dallas, and I even worked at one for a bit if you're curious to my credibility.Had the misfortune of trying phö at several spots around SoFlo including Pho 79 (weak, flavorless broth + old ingredients, ew), 3 Chefs, and a Wynwood spot that's now closed (won't be missed). Phö 305 was the first time my mouth felt at home in this arena. FINALLY. It took years of trial and error to find a fave. Hole-in-the-wall, friendly and straightforward service, don't expect anything fancy at all, sodas served in cans, dining room could def use some improvements tho I was comfortable -- but what matters most: you'll get a very tasty bowl of Phö here, and a generous serving too!Only a date spot if he/she/they are into you, low maintenance, and you've had the fancy first couple dates already. Go get it!",
      "Very nice owner! He left us in earlier to sit because we thought they opened at 11am on Sunday.Bun bo hue was very good!! Definitely would come back and recommend!",
      "Pho 305 is the most authentic and delicious Pho in Miami. I've been to Vietnam and lived in Los Angeles for years (huge Vietnamese population with good Pho spots). When I moved to Miami, I tried a lot of Pho places (Tran An, Pho Mo, Phuc Yea, etc) and none of them compare to the taste and quality of Pho 305, it is now my regular spot. The customer service is fantastic. Get to know Tommy, the owner, he is passionate about his cooking. He spends 48 hours cooking every batch of broth and buys the freshest, quality ingredients and meat for his restaurant. This isn't fine dining, but it's a local authentic business worth supporting. My favorite is the Beef Tenderloin Pho!!!",
      "Place:This is probably the only authentic pho place in Miami. We did not need a reservation and there was enough space for 8 people.  Service:The service was good and they recommended thai tea and it was pretty good!Food $:We all pho and it was good!Audience:Solo Trip [X]21+ [ ]Family Friendly [X]Friends [X]Date Spot [ ]Recommendations/tips:I would recommend this place if you crave pho",
      "Best pho I've had in miami yet. I tried the beef combo pho and it was very authentic and flavorful. I like how they have all the sauces on the table as well. I also got a taro boba tea, it was taro flavored. The drink had great flavor and was frothy and poured over ice. Some of the tapioca was slightly tough but that's the only complaint.Highly recommend this place for pho.",
      "Absolutely the best Pho in Miami and even better than Los Angeles. It's the same perfection every time and I eat here 2-3 times a week. Soooo good!",
      "Taro milk tea w/ boba is creamy & delicious, not too sweet. Boba is fresh and soft and has a hint of sweetness for a little punch. So good  Fresh rolls were fresh, nothing special but good. Same with the vegan spring roll. Same with the thai iced tea. Nothing special but good.The pho was good. Would definitely come back!",
      "Great PHO!!! And Egg rolls!! The pho is a very home made taste. It def is one best pho I have had.",
      "I am a pho addict and this place is everything.... When I die I want their Pho Tai as my last meal on earth",
      "Very overpriced. 18% tip will be included when you ordered. I was gonna ask for extra bowl but there is a sign saying \"$3 convenience fees will be charge per sharing tableware (plate, bowl, dish, chopsticks, utensils\". $3 for chopsticks you're kidding? What a scam. The noodles weren't anything special either. Will not come again. Will not recommend. Also, we had to clean the table ourselves. We haven't got any services after we purchased our food this place is not worth even one star"

I don't remember the names of the rolls we got but I did enjoy them! The salmon crispy rice was so fresh and the rice was perfectly crisp. The bao buns were also very savory and flavorful. I definitely would recommend coming to this place for a date night or fun night out. We loved the food and can't wait to come back!",
      "Dear Gabriela, Thank you for sharing your experience. We are happy to know you enjoyed your visit to Paperfish and you enjoyed the salmon crispy rice, and cocktails. We look forward to seeing you again soon. Best regards!",
      "Now this spot was next level. Came here for my brothers birthday at his request and upon arriving, well, it was a brilliant scene. The Japanese decor was amazing and so detailed. Loved the ambiance and was definitely feeling the vibe. I can see why everyone kept telling me to check this place out. You can either use street parking or there is a garage across the street where you can park as well. It's a bit hidden down an alley but easy to locate by the impressive staircase at the entrance of the restaurant. We met the hostess and we had a reservation so we sat down right away. We sat on the inside of the restaurant but they also do have a large patio section on the outside for those who prefer that. An absolute highlight are the cherry blossoms right in the middle across from the sushi bar. Definitely a site to see and only makes me want to go to Japan even more now!We were a group of 6 so we had a little bit of everything because I eat with my eyes every single time and over order right in cue lol.The favorites were:- Crispy Truffle fried rice with Wagyu steak- Hot truffle Nigiri- Maguro Foie - Smoked rocoto ceviche All the plates are definitely shareable and this is a spot to come check out with friends and enjoy a couple of cocktails while enjoying some good grub. My one issue was the service. Our server wasn't very attentive and kept coming back to the table to either ask us to repeat our order or tell us that he didn't know something was out in the kitchen. This shouldn't be happening at a restaurant like this. Servers get weeded and I get that but the service lacked in every aspect. The food and ambiance are what made my experience memorable. If they can nail this particular part next time I come around, then it would be a perfect experience.Either way, I do recommend giving this spot a try, just maybe don't go on a busy night lol.",
      "Dear Marcelino, it is not every day that we receive feedback as detailed and thoughtful as yours. thank you very much, we appreciate it. We look forward to having you back again soon.",
      "I only do ~2 reviews a year-- basically the best & worst experiences I have all year.Baby corn-- just oyster sauce?Tuna hand roll-- no flavor, little fish, *super* cold riceHamachi jalapeno-- okay I guess? Very little fish, basically Had more, nothing of note...",
      "The food, cocktails and service were okay - I've been to some exceptional sushi restaurants in Miami, so it's hard to not compare. It wasn't bad, but I probably would not go again unless someone invited me.  I got lucky and found street parking, otherwise I was planning to valet. I had a hard time finding this place after I parked because the GPS kept taking me to the back of the building.",
      "Sharlee, thank you so much for this review. We really appreciate you being a customer. We’re here for you anytime.",
      "We came for dinner and it did not disappoint! The ambiance is amazing. Menu 10/10. We had the best experience,We had the Paper Tuna, Salmon Furai, California, and the Himachi Jalepeno. Everything was amazing! Rocio was our server and she was very friendly and attentive all throughout the evening! She even recommended a few other late night establishments in the area.Top notch service and exceptional atmosphere! Do yourself a favor and check it out!",
      "Andrew, thank you for your positive feedback. We are pleased to know our service was top notch and that our atmosphere was to your liking. We hope to see you again soon.",
      "Loved the ambiance of this place. The interior was stunning with pink floral details while on outdoor Terrance they had hanging lanterns. The atmosphere of paper crane was lively and I enjoyed the music in the background as well. There's a lot of potential here as the food was very good; however they are heavily lacking in service. We waited about 45 min for one of our rolls to come out and I felt like I had to ask for everything since the server was not very attentive. After seeing the couple next to us seated, given food, and leave before we even got our roll it was hard to take the excuse that they were \"just really busy\". Although the food came out very spaced out, we enjoyed the flavors of the crispy fried rice with shrimp, wagu and salmon nigiri, paper tuna roll and hamachi tirado. Loved the tuna Tartar inside the paper tuna roll but wished they put a different fish on the top as it was overpowering of tuna. The hamachi tirado had salmon roe on top and a sauce that should not have been paired with lime- it was overly acidic and took away from the fresh fish. Salmon nigiri with the truffle flavor was my favorite! Overall, I'm glad I came here to eat but would suggest reserving this place for takeout. No soap in the bathrooms, bare minimum service, and not a lot of attention to details. Food is great and I'd try more menu options next time!",
      "Such a trendy new restaurant in Brickell, they have another newer location in south beach. They do offer self parking I believe it's 10$ the restaurant may be hard to miss based on which way you are walking from as the entrance is on the side of the building and not in the front facing the road. Inside the ambiance is beautiful with Japanese cherry blossom trees, beautiful art work and color changing lights. The menu ranges in prices but around 20 something for an entree. The sushi was delicious. For the happy hour it did not have many options and it doesn't come with that many rolls. As the fish was nice and fresh but you can probably finish all the roles in a few minutes. The tuna foi Gras was soo amazing and creamy and once again finished in less than a few minutes. It took more than we usually order to get full. But I believe it's because some items took longer to come out than others. Overall our waiter was very nice, love the ambiance and beautiful delicious restaurant.",
      "Nice sushi place in Miami, I went there for my birthday. Have a great time, enjoy the food, the service. Food was really good, I like the house sushi rolls. We tried a couple of cocktails those were really good as well. Dessert was on the house and they even sing happy birthday for me. The ambiance is super nice with cool decoration, Japanese visuals in a big screen, Japanese paper lamps and very important Sakura trees (fake) but looked very cool. I recommend this place, with the understanding that it is not for super high end food, but still is ok and there is good ambiance and service, hence the 3-stars",
      "Paper Fish sushi, This place is high end restaurant to go for. The menus is not like other sushi places. They don't have bento boxes. There is no chicken options, the menu is super limited unfortunately. However,The quality of the sushi that we ordered it was super great.",
      "Thank you so much for this review. We really appreciate you being a customer. We’re here for you anytime.",
      "I fell in love with this place - pure japanese atmosphere and ambiance.The food was delicuous, we were a big group and did a set family style menu and there was not a single thing that was not great.Service was on point, our server was really attentive and always came at the perfect time to refill our drinks.10/10 recommend",
      "Barbara, thank you for your excellent rating.  We are glad our food was delicious and that our service was on point. We hope to see you again very soon."

From the apps to the main course and the desserts; you can't go wrong! This is the perfect spot for happy hour, a group outing or a date night. Highly recommend making a reservation on busy weekends.",
      "Good food and stellar ambiance. A decent happy hour but otherwise high prices for quantity. The rooftop is so cute and chic with plenty of seating and string lights all around. There was lovely live music when I was there on a Wednesday night but it was still easy to get a table and service was still well-paced.Good vegetarian options that are actually vegetable forward. The brussel sprouts were amazing but portion size was fairly small for price when you consider it was a vegetable dish. Value was better on the happy hour wine, which was available until 7.",
      "I've been wanting to try out Cebada since they opened since I've heard nothing but good things. Unfortunately on the day that we made the reservation it was raining, but they still have a covered space to seat us.Our server came over right away, and we all ordered passion fruit. Mojito's were delicious. Most of the food is tapas style so you'll share it with everybody. To start we ordered the corn ribs which is basically corn sliced off the stock with cheese and seasoning on it. I haven't had corn this way, but it was delicious. We also ordered the Croquetas, which came in a pack of six round Croquetas of Jamón(ham). They were very tasty and the sauce was a perfect complement to them. Lastly, for the appetizers, we ordered the baby back ribs, and those were my favorite! Full of flavor, and fall off the bone deliciousness.For the main course, we shared the flap steak which is large enough in my opinion to be split between two people. A friend of ours had the garlic fettuccine, and it was also very very good. We were too full to have any of dessert but I'm sure the desserts are also amazing. We all had a great time, and I would definitely like to come back to see the happy hour vibe on a sunny day. Even in the rain they had covered options and everything was great so we will definitely be back. It actually wasn't as normally packed. Which meant we got our food faster which was a good thing since we were hungry!",
      "What a wonderful place to meet up for some drinks or dinner. Started off at the bar during happy hour, ordered myself one of the house draft cocktails called \"Relax, it only tingles a little\" and not only was it refreshing and delicious but so cutely decorated, a flamingo printed straw and a decorative flamingo on my drink, it was so good I had to order a second one and this time it came with a cactus decorated straw and a little yellow ducky for decoration. After the drinks we asked to sit at a table and even though we didn't have a reservation we were quickly sat. We had a wonderful dinner under the full moon and every dish we ordered was better than the one before. We shared all of the dishes we ordered so we could try all the items. Started with some cauliflower, seasoned in a cream sauce and toasted breadcrumbs, so yummy. Also ordered the smoked duck drummets, a first for me, and the meat was falling off the bone. The Australian flap steak we ordered was also cooked to the temperature we asked for and was flavorful. And for dessert we ordered the Tina donut balls which were so light and fluffy that it was hard to stop eating those little bite size deliciousness. I highly recommend all these dishes and already planned another visit to keep exploring the menu.",
      "Love coming to this rooftop bar. The food is great as well as the service. Located in beautiful Coral Gables, this place is a must.",
      "Great place for drinks.Love the ambiance and the service was great, super fasta and on top of everything.I had a few nespresso martini drinks and the server was so nice she made them with rum instead of boca - delicious!I'll be back",
      "Super cute rooftop bar in the Gables and the drink names are so witty and the happy hour specials great. Nice vibe and the bartenders were so nice and friendly. They gave awesome suggestions regarding the food and drink. I would definitely return to try dinner here. Definitely check this spot out if you want a nice outdoor drink and/or dinner.",
      "I missed a flight to Turks & Caicos and was 'stuck' in Miami overnight. I stayed in a Marriott near the airport and looked for a place to eat that Saturday night. I looked at Cebada and saw they recommend reservations. I called and since I was a solo diner they said walk in only. I took a Lyft there and walked to the restaurant near the Main Street. I took a seat along the ledge overlooking the street. My server recommended a drink based off my preferences. I originally asked for Two White Guys go to a donkey show but she asked if I like chipotle or smoky flavors. I ended up going with Bruh why are your pants so tight. It was delicious and refreshing. I had the mushroom croquettas- soooo good! I loved the pickled red onions! For my entree I went with the truffled oyster pasta. My meal was great and the vibe was even better! The weather was PERFECT!",
      "One of my favorite spots in the Gables! The cutest rooftop bar with the best tapas and cocktails! Looking for a spot to have happy hour with friends, a birthday dinner or even a date night! This little rooftop bar is definitely the spot! There are so many delicious options to choose from! We did a tapas style dinner and just shared a bunch of appetizers to try a few things on the menu! What we ordered - - Fish dip on a crispy chip 10/10- Raw oysters 9/10- Ceviche 10/10 - Jamón Serrano Croquetas con Queso 11/10 (must try) - Margarita (cocktail) 11/10 Ambiance is lovely and food is delish!Can't go wrong with this spot! Enjoy!",
      "Came here for happy hour and was not disappointed! Delicious food and drinks with a great atmosphere. My friend and I sat at the bar, and the bartenders were very attentive throughout our night. The lobster rolls are a must along with the croquetas. I will definitely be back."

      "Hands down my favorite restaurant in Miami. Ambiance is upbeat and intimate. Food is AMAZING does not miss in the year I've been going consistently. Service is outstanding .",
      "Amazing steakhouse Our favorite was the the Australian Wagyu which I can only say was perfection. their sides were so perfectly complimentary. Truffle Mac and cheese, the Brussels sprouts, spinach, broccolini and cauliflower were excellent. Beef lettuce wraps were decent, beet salad was good, kids meals were devoured. ALSO if you're here for breakfast their buffet is great",
      "WOW - To say I was completely blown away by my first time dining here would be an understatement. Whether you're celebrating a special occasion or just craving a delectable meal that will leave you speechless, this is the spot that will be sure to leave a lasting impression. From the lavish and trendy decor, the out of this world dishes, beautiful presentations and impeccable service, every detail was taken well into consideration and perfected.I can say with certainty that this is one of the most gorgeous spaces I've ever eaten a meal in. The sultry vibe, elegantly designed interior, endless display of wine bottles scattered throughout the restaurant and the stunning bar will have you feeling like you're in the midst of dining amongst celebrities. There didn't seem to be a bad table to dine at in sight, but my parents and I were lucky enough to snag one of the beautiful half-moon booths toward the center of the room. When is the last time you've been to a restaurant that brings complimentary French fries to the table? And not just any regular ole' French fries, but a delicious trio of French fries each complimented by their own unique dipping sauce? Bet it's probably never happened before, unless you've eaten here. I thought this was such a neat but simple touch that really set them apart from other high-end restaurants. They also bring yummy rolls topped with sea salt to the table (between the fries & the bread, you might end up in a food coma before you even order if you're not careful). I ordered the tuna tartar for an appetizer and I was in heaven every time I took a bite. Not only does it melt in your mouth, but the presentation alone is enough reason to order this (the way they mix it for you makes for a fun video opportunity if you have your phone ready to record). My parents shared a shrimp cocktail that they both enjoyed - The shrimp were massive! Following the appetizers, I munched on a cesar salad which was perfectly dressed. Now... the STEAK. Holy moly, one of the best filet mignons I have had yet. It was ridiculously flavorful, tender & juicy. Melted in your mouth and bursted with flavor. If you're a steak lover, it would be a crime to come here and not order it. The mashed potatoes that accompanied it were also flavorful, but I thought they were a little too runny (my only complaint of the whole meal). If you're a fan of grilled onions, do yourself a favor and order a side of these to top your steak with and thank me later. The \"Smoked Chocolate S'mores\" dessert was ridiculously decadent and was the perfect finish to an impeccable meal. Yes, it's insanely pricy and yes, it's totally worth it. My experience here was one of the best dining experiences I've ever had in Miami - And that says a lot given the fact that Miami is one of the hottest spots in the country for foodies. This restaurant hit it out the park for me and I'm already searching for an excuse to go back to South Florida and to savor new dishes on their menu.",
      "The restaurant is spacious and nice. Bar is nice as well.Staff was friendly and attentive.For appetizers the tuna tartare was fresh and seasoned well.They also bring you French fries 3 different ways with 3 different sauces. I had the certified Angus rib cap cooked medium rare and It was good and flavorful. The side of Mac and Cheese was good as well.",
      "Our favorite was the the Australian Wagyu which I can only say was perfection.",
      "Ambiance was awesome. The dishes, coctails and the dessert were so delicious. All the employees were so polite and friendly. They celebrated our honeymoon with a cute card, it was so nice.They made our special day unforgettable.",
      "Wonderful experience! Fabulous service. Timing, everything was a 10.  Our server really made our night fabulous, she was awesome. Great steak, Mac and cheese with truffle was really nice. Molten cake was super good as well. I must say everything was impeccable.",
      "Phenomenal cuisine. Never have a enjoyed such a succulent and flavourful sea bass - it is one of their renowned specials. But the lack of bones in the fish was made up for by the pained bones in my rear.The decor was beautiful but very far from comfortable. The low chairs were too uncomfortable for eating. The benches; built for slaves.The overall experience was truly hampered by a god awful designer deserving of life in prison for her domestic terror on comfort. 4/5 not bad",
      "This plus is amazing! We had a private room & our server was Erin. Erin was very pleasant, patient, informative & very professional. She suggested several appetizers & dinner. It was our first time visiting this restaurant & it definitely won't be our last.",
      "Food was incredible. I love that when you get to the table instead of getting some bread you get french fries. Service was also impeccable and ambiance is very family friendly in my opinion"

      "Seaspice was amazing. It's a fantastic restaurant with a great view right on the Miami River. If you don't right you can catch the live music as the sun sets, and the restaurant transforms to a lounge. Totally worth coming Parking is tricky, and if you're not paying attention you might miss it as you drive by. But it's a gem worth coming back to.",
      "Seaspice is known to Miami locals as a very high end resturant, frequented by celebrities.  I have no idea why.  The service is pretty awful.  The drink runners are horrible.  It takes about 30 minutes for just a drink to be brought out to you.  The food is mediocre.  It is definitely NOT worth the price, which is very expensive.  I am giving two stars because the view is amazing.  Seaspice is right on the water and has a gorgeous ambiance.  You can watch yachts drive by and some will even pull up and park.  The other star is for the tres leches.  This dessert was AMAZING, I would go back just to eat it again.  But otherwise, Seaspice is nothing special.  Save your money.",
      "A place that tries to be high end but fails to deliver.Service ? Mediocre Food ? Below parFirst thing when you check in is they tell you that you have a 2 hr max(tacky)",
      "I read this was one of the best patio dining AND a hot spot for celebrities in Miami, so I had to go check it out on our recent travels to this area...Initially I was worried about our luggage situation, as we had to carry our luggage to the restaurant since this was our last stop in Miami. However, they were very accommodating, and let us store some of our stuff in the closet, and we kept the big luggage with us, near our table.As expected, the patio scene was spectacular...city skyline and seaside views, with plenty of yachts passing by! The place indeed had that chic celebrity vibe...truly FAB! Loved the music overhead as well. Somehow, I expected some snobbiness...but not at all. Service was great!Then the food. OMFG...I've had some amazing foods lately, but this takes the cake. Even the complimentary bread was amazing (and unique)! My husband ordered this Wagyu Burger, and I chose this Ragu Pappardelle ( THE best Ragu Pappardelle I've ever had...EVER. ). Then this Pavola dessert...again, just beyond delish. Truly, this was foods for the celebrities.Honestly, I'm shocked at how low the rating is for this place. I assume that if the service isn't top notch, it would probably piss some folks off. The pricing was on the outlandish side...with even lunch entrees starting at around 40. There was even an appetizer item priced at around 70 bucks! Luckily, like I said, I felt that the foods and the service (and especially the spectacular ambiance) made up for it. There was this big yacht parked right near us, which somewhat blocked some of the views from the left. Still, we got our eyeful of seaside/yachtside views.In any case, this was a great way to end our trip in Miami.",
      "Went here with a group of girlfriends for brunch and everything was delicious, they were super accommodating as well.I had the froze , a cucumber and gin cocktail and 2 grey goose and sodas and all were fantastic.As a table we split the fresh fish and a couple sides and it was delicious. Also love the free bread It is definitely on the pricier side overall tbh but great for a fun \"fancy\" brunch",
      "Came here for Miami spice and although we spent more than we thought we would, we had a good time. Everything was delicious. The kale Caesar had pecans and Granny Smith apple slices, never had a Caesar like this but it was a nice change! The Shrimp Pesto Whole Wheat Spaghetti was my favorite, even though I'm not the biggest fan of pesto. The burger was good too just a little messy from the truffle aioli. The chocolate cremoso and tres leches was very good but I'd go with the cremoso for the cocoa nib crumble, yum! All in all, I think it's overpriced and I probably won't come here again because of that. The cheapest bottle of Chardonnay was $75 and most drinks were $20. I only came here for Miami spice and still spent almost $200.",
      "Given we still have Miami Spice going on until the end of the month we decided to try out the lunch menu @ Seaspice gorgeous location on the Miami River, sitting outdoor is really relaxing, so beautiful to watch the boats go by, really lovely To start we had the Comte' Cheese Soufflé, I have to admit this was a bit disappointing, it really did not have the texture of a real soufflé  but then............ the Shrimp Pesto Whole Wheat Spaghetti and the Pan-Seared Chilean Seabass were really good as dessert, both the Tres Leches and the Chocolate Cremoso were yummy Try it out before Miami Spice ends, you can check out the Miami Spice Menus on miamiandthebeaches.com@seaspicemia",
      "First time for me at Seaspice, it is located on the banks of the Miami River it is a gem that you should not miss. Sit outside in the courtyard enjoy your food and a drinks while watching the boats go by, just beautiful We had the Miami Spice lunch which has a very affordable fix price 3 course menu for $ 28, unfortunately this will end soon, nevertheless, I would defiantly go back again for sureRegarding the Miami Spice menu only one observation, they should have had more than one choice for the Entrees without the extra charge, right now you have 4 choices and 3 of these have extra charge on it, not really fair given that you are promoting the Spice menu, you should have at least two or three choices included in the price and one or two with the extra charge We had had Prince Edward Island Mussels, Grilled, the Grilled Faroe Island Salmon and the Profiteroles and Peaches and Cream. My favorite where the Mussels, the garlic pizza bread they brought for the table was absolutely delicious, the Salmon was good too. I had the Peaches for dessert and it was ok, not really my thing, my friend said the Profiteroles were great, next time I will not opt for the healthy dessert We enjoyed all with a good Albariño wine, our experience was made especially enjoyable by our waiter Fabrizio, he was really great ! Thank you Fabrizio @seaspicemia",
      "Bad first impression. Its not a nice feeling to feel like you have to beg to spend your money at a restaurant. Every year I look forward to Miami Spice. It's a great way to try out various restaurants and a unique spread of menu options. Seaspice was on my radar and happened to be one of the participating restaurants offering the Miami Spice menu. I contacted the restaurant in advance and made a reservation for 3:30p for a party of four. My mom who is from out of town was excited to join us for lunch. I advised the restaurant we were doing the Miami Spice menu. The restaurant made it clear that they charge $50pp for No Shows. At 3:15pm, we arrived for our reservation. The hostess Karin greeted us, and advised us that they were running behind on the reservations and because of this they will not be able to offer the Miami Spice menu. Only the a la-carte menu will be offered. This was a bit upsetting because we drove almost an hour to get there and the restaurant is refusing to offer the Miami Spice promotion. Our natural instinct was to just say forget it we will go somewhere else. I mean, at the end of the day who wants to beg to spend their money? It's absurd. If the restaurant is offering a promotional menu and because to no fault of our own they are running behind why should we be penalized?My Mom looked so bummed out. Because she was so excited to try this place. I decided to walk back in and ask for a Manager. The Manager took 20min to come out. When he finally did come over, he introduced himself as Collin. I explained to him what was going on and it seemed as though he wasn't aware that the hostesses were turning Miami Spice customers away. He decided to make it right and advised Karin to honor the Miami Spice menu. Impressive! Things were turning around. Besides the encounter at the hostess stand, the restaurant is beautiful. It is situated on Miami's waterfront were you can view the million dollar yachts passing by. They also have docks for those interested in docking and dining. You can view the downtown city skyline which I am sure looks amazing at night.The food was excellent. The Miami Spice menu offered a three course lunch for $28. You have the choice of a starter (Kale Salad, Cheese Souffle, or White Gazpacho). A choice of entrees (Seabass, Chicken Breast, Shrimp Pesto Pasta, Wagyu Burger, or Plant Bowl). And a choice of dessert (Tres Leches or Chocolate Cremoso). They also offer the option to add a Glass of wine for and additional $12. I ordered the Comte Cheese Souffle, the Green Circle Farms Chicken Breast, and the Tres Leches. The others in my party ordered the Kale Salad, Gazpacho, and Seabass. For starters, My favorites were the Kale Caesar Salad and Cheese Souffle. The Kale Caesar had a mix of shredded Granny Smith apples, pecans and a creamy Caesar dressing. The cheese Souffle was like a fluffy egg Souffle with a cream parmesan sauce and tomato chutney. Delicious!For entrees, both the Seabass and Chicken breast were amazing. The Chicken breast was tender and juicy, served on top of a creamy polenta and topped with corn, peas, and mushrooms. The seabass was seared nicely to give a nice crunch on the outside, while perfectly flaky and moist on the inside. It was served with stewed garbanzo, Swiss chard, and smoked potato. For desserts, we all had Tres Leches. It was served in a small Mason jar topped with 3 milks, and berries. Perfect way to end the meal. The portions are not large but it is filling. The flavors are fresh and very well balanced. The food presentation was notable. The Watermelon Tequila drink was delightful and refreshing. The froze was also a big hit. The cocktails were presented well and created perfectly. We enjoyed everything. Our waiter, Austin was very friendly. He made great recommendations and was very attentive.An 18% gratuity was added to the tab. There are lots of street parking accessible. In the end, the food was great. Ambience was amazing. The hostesses can use additional customer service training and learn to use better judgment to improve the customers experience. There was no need to escalate the matters to a manager. It could have been handled properly by showing empathy, apologizing, and finding a solution to the problem.",
      "Hi Kim,Thank you for dining with us and leaving a detailed review. It has been forwarded to our management team. Our apologies for the confusion at the door.  Glad to hear Collin accommodated you and your experience was turned around.  We are happy to see your great feedback regarding the food, cocktails, and Austin’s Service.  Hopefully you will join us again in the near future!",
      "This is my second time going to sea spice & I normally love it as the first time. I never leave bad reviews But this second time MY PHONE WAS STOLEN AND SECURITIES DID NOThing about it. Instead we're trying to blame me for the situation. I'm not drunk nor was drunk. I walked in with 2 phone and walked out with 1.We came as my friend USUALLY does and this is how they treated us  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME. I thought it was 5 star so nothing could go wrong. With a security right next to our table my phone STILLL got stolen. It was on the table. And to whoever has the time to steal phones is just sad imagine what else they can steal... I wil ask to review cameras but with the way I was treated when I let them know I lost my phone I doubt they will be helpful but I'll let every platform form of review know that they steal phones here. I know the exact time frame as well so they wouldn't even have to look much at the cameras. Let's see. BTW I BEEN HOME SICK AFTER EATING THESE OYSTERS I COULDNT Even celebrate my baby's birthday w him.",
      "Came here for my birthday dinner with my boyfriend for a 7:15 reservation (we called in advance for an outdoor seat dock side) we waited about ten minutes after our arrival for our table to be ready at the bar, the short wait was definitely worth it. Started with an aperol spritz at the bar then ordered octopus and gazpacho to start. Octopus portion was good but the olive oil tasted burnt since it came out on a sizzling hot cast iron looking skillet (its very easy to overcook octopus, please just bring a regular plate next time.) I also had the whole main lobster. Extremely delicious large portion of perfectly cooked and seasoned lobster, bravo. My boyfriend had the truffle coated Chilean sea bass and he absolutely loved it. Vibe: 5/5 this place definitely is a scene but not overwhelmingly pretentious or obnoxious. Absolutely loved the music as well. Service:3/5 A bit slow, our server was very attentive when we were able to get his attention but we had to always wave him down. Food: 4/5 everything was honestly pretty good (octopus could've had a bit more attention to detail)",
      "Hi Liz,Thank you for celebrating your birthday with us!  We are so happy to hear you had a great experience and enjoyed the food.  Your feedback regarding the octopus has been sent to our chef. We look forward to seeing you again soon!"

      "Hands down my favorite restaurant in Miami. Ambiance is upbeat and intimate. Food is AMAZING does not miss in the year I've been going consistently. Service is outstanding .",
      "Amazing steakhouse Our favorite was the the Australian Wagyu which I can only say was perfection. their sides were so perfectly complimentary. Truffle Mac and cheese, the Brussels sprouts, spinach, broccolini and cauliflower were excellent. Beef lettuce wraps were decent, beet salad was good, kids meals were devoured. ALSO if you're here for breakfast their buffet is great",
      "WOW - To say I was completely blown away by my first time dining here would be an understatement. Whether you're celebrating a special occasion or just craving a delectable meal that will leave you speechless, this is the spot that will be sure to leave a lasting impression. From the lavish and trendy decor, the out of this world dishes, beautiful presentations and impeccable service, every detail was taken well into consideration and perfected.I can say with certainty that this is one of the most gorgeous spaces I've ever eaten a meal in. The sultry vibe, elegantly designed interior, endless display of wine bottles scattered throughout the restaurant and the stunning bar will have you feeling like you're in the midst of dining amongst celebrities. There didn't seem to be a bad table to dine at in sight, but my parents and I were lucky enough to snag one of the beautiful half-moon booths toward the center of the room. When is the last time you've been to a restaurant that brings complimentary French fries to the table? And not just any regular ole' French fries, but a delicious trio of French fries each complimented by their own unique dipping sauce? Bet it's probably never happened before, unless you've eaten here. I thought this was such a neat but simple touch that really set them apart from other high-end restaurants. They also bring yummy rolls topped with sea salt to the table (between the fries & the bread, you might end up in a food coma before you even order if you're not careful). I ordered the tuna tartar for an appetizer and I was in heaven every time I took a bite. Not only does it melt in your mouth, but the presentation alone is enough reason to order this (the way they mix it for you makes for a fun video opportunity if you have your phone ready to record). My parents shared a shrimp cocktail that they both enjoyed - The shrimp were massive! Following the appetizers, I munched on a cesar salad which was perfectly dressed. Now... the STEAK. Holy moly, one of the best filet mignons I have had yet. It was ridiculously flavorful, tender & juicy. Melted in your mouth and bursted with flavor. If you're a steak lover, it would be a crime to come here and not order it. The mashed potatoes that accompanied it were also flavorful, but I thought they were a little too runny (my only complaint of the whole meal). If you're a fan of grilled onions, do yourself a favor and order a side of these to top your steak with and thank me later. The \"Smoked Chocolate S'mores\" dessert was ridiculously decadent and was the perfect finish to an impeccable meal. Yes, it's insanely pricy and yes, it's totally worth it. My experience here was one of the best dining experiences I've ever had in Miami - And that says a lot given the fact that Miami is one of the hottest spots in the country for foodies. This restaurant hit it out the park for me and I'm already searching for an excuse to go back to South Florida and to savor new dishes on their menu.",
      "The restaurant is spacious and nice. Bar is nice as well.Staff was friendly and attentive.For appetizers the tuna tartare was fresh and seasoned well.They also bring you French fries 3 different ways with 3 different sauces. I had the certified Angus rib cap cooked medium rare and It was good and flavorful. The side of Mac and Cheese was good as well.",
      "Our favorite was the the Australian Wagyu which I can only say was perfection.",
      "Ambiance was awesome. The dishes, coctails and the dessert were so delicious. All the employees were so polite and friendly. They celebrated our honeymoon with a cute card, it was so nice.They made our special day unforgettable.",
      "Wonderful experience! Fabulous service. Timing, everything was a 10.  Our server really made our night fabulous, she was awesome. Great steak, Mac and cheese with truffle was really nice. Molten cake was super good as well. I must say everything was impeccable.",
      "Phenomenal cuisine. Never have a enjoyed such a succulent and flavourful sea bass - it is one of their renowned specials. But the lack of bones in the fish was made up for by the pained bones in my rear.The decor was beautiful but very far from comfortable. The low chairs were too uncomfortable for eating. The benches; built for slaves.The overall experience was truly hampered by a god awful designer deserving of life in prison for her domestic terror on comfort. 4/5 not bad",
      "This plus is amazing! We had a private room & our server was Erin. Erin was very pleasant, patient, informative & very professional. She suggested several appetizers & dinner. It was our first time visiting this restaurant & it definitely won't be our last.",
      "Food was incredible. I love that when you get to the table instead of getting some bread you get french fries. Service was also impeccable and ambiance is very family friendly in my opinion"

      "Amazing food and service! Friendly ambiance, loved it! I definitely recommend this restaurant for genuine Portuguese food.",
      "A hidden gem. Delicious and authentic food. I've tried many Portuguese restaurants in Fl, I was ver surprised by the freshness and tasty food. Great and friendly service",
      "Where to begin...my friend Frank recommended this place because of not only the food but the service and now I see why. Raul, the owner, and the staff are the most welcoming and friendly people in the restaurant business. I can say I was treated like family all 8 hours I was there, yes I was there that long because of how delicious the food is, and how the treatment goes a long way. Raul treated me and of course Frank who he knows as if we were family and his staff does the same, but let's talk about this food...   When I got there I saw the Portuguese sausage only found in Portuguese restaurants in its captivating presentation which it's recorded in a video I posted but it tastes even better than it looks...juicy and flavorful. Second app was the octopus just because I'm a sucker for a good charred octopus and this has to be one of the best I've had anywhere. All this accompanied with a nice cold glass of white wine.   The main dish: seafood rice...most fresh fish, clams, petite lobster tail and packed with flavor, rice a la chorrera like a risotto and cooked to perfection, one of the best paella rice I've had in town. Then my friend Frank ordered the codfish(Bacalau) in nata which consisted of a casserole with potatoes, onions and codfish in a creamy sauce topped with melted cheese and this was one of the most delicious codfish dishes I've ever tasted, I mean like to die for. After all this we didn't have room for desert so we just continued to have a good time with staff while sipping on a few more bottles of a Spanish red and a Portuguese white. This place left a pleasant impression on me so they will see more of me very often. Will come back to hang out with Raul, his staff and enjoy more delicious food.",
      "This place has really good food and it is served at the right temperature. It is a small place however it has a very nice outside area. The owner was there and took the time to tell us his story of how he migrated to America and with a culinary love he dicided to open his rastaurant.",
      "Definitely a place to come back. The food was so good, temperature excellent, service excellent. We never felt we were left behind and they were always polite. We dined outside and it was very nice.",
      "We went for lunch and we sat outside, because it was really nice out. Our server was very friendly and attentive. We ordered our drinks and appetizers and they were delicious. We had the codfish fritters and they were delicious! Our entrees were also very good. I had the grilled octopus and it was outstanding! For dessert we shared a cake and it was delicious. The owner came out and he was very attentive to us. I'd definitely recommend this place for lunch or dinner!",
      "From the moment arriving until the time to say good evening, this was a top notch experience. The owner Rui Silva, is from Braga, hence the name of the restaurant. The food was entirely authentic Portuguese. Tried the choriço asado and the polvo grelhada as starters, and a house specialty, Bacalhau a Braga as main entrée. All were excellent!!!  The owner treats you like family eating at his house and the service is excellent,which is extremely hard to find in Miami. Obrigado Braga!! Até breve!!",
      "This place is amazing!!!! Amazing service, amazing food, beautiful location. My husbands parents brought us here to celebrate my 30th birthday and omg I'm so happy they did. The owner is sooooo nice - he is there every night and talks to everyone. The service is amazing. Always attentive. Very fast. So friendly. Honestly one of the places with best service I've ever gotten. They gave us complimentary port at the end of our meal as dessert. So nice and thoughtful l. Food - omg this place was just amazing. We got the vacalao croquetas for an appetizer. They were delicious!!! Then ordered the grilled octopus as the main dish and hands down this was the best grilled octopus I have ever had in my life. The portions were huge! I took back home food, which was enough for another meal after. Love this place. So happy I found it. Will be coming back!!!!",
      "Overjoyed with this restaurant, it's staff, THE FOOD & the owner. I got to meet Senhor Braga himself! He is amazing, funny and so accommodating. This is one of my neighborhood faves now. Everything we ate here was 5 stars. The food was fresh, delicious and super tasty. We also tried a green wine called Gitao, that I had never heard of but was recommended by Mr. Braga himself. And I loved it, wine usually hurts my stomach but this was gentle and extremely refreshing! Yes, go to Braga, you won't be disappointed. I'll be back for this one.",
      "I can't thank more a friend that suggested me to check Braga. Food, if you like fish and seafood is outstanding, and the best part is the service, directly from the owner Raul, who will make you feel welcomed and like at his home. Highly recommended. Now added to one of my favorites."

      "OKAY JAGUAR SUN, I SEE YOU!! This spot had been on my list for awhile, but the menu was deterring me due to the small selection of food items. We were in the mood for a good cocktail and decided to bite the bullet. Let me tell you, JAGUAR SUN IS THE MOVE. The restaurant is dark and hip. You'll find yourself enjoying the comfortable seating and lush greenery surrounding you. Such a perfect spot for a first date or simple date night. Everything is served on dishes that look like they were thrifted or stolen from your grandmas house. Loved this as it added to the whole vibe. Our cocktails were SO good! My boyfriend and I agreed we were feeling some type of way from the drinks. Typically, I find myself needing at least two cocktails before I'm feeling something or the drinks feel on the smaller side. These drinks were strong, delicious, and the perfect size. Those bartenders really know what they're doing. Their cocktail menu also has such a wide array of flavors and ingredients. I love trying new things, so this is the spot if you're like me. The Living Dead was my favorite out of all the cocktails we tried! I don't think the pasta is homemade (I could be wrong), but it was top tier pasta nevertheless. I don't even like mushrooms and the tagliatelle somehow impressed me. I believe the second pasta we ordered was called cavatelli. Not sure how they made their sauce, but I will be trying to recreate that in my kitchen. My boyfriend mentioned he's not a fan of tomato's and same with the mushrooms for me, he was throughly impressed with this dish. I strongly encourage you to try some of their dishes that fall under your typical dislike category, because I think you'll be surprised. Scallops were so good the way they were served. Would definitely recommend ordering the tuna tartare. I'll stop ranting about this place so you can stop reading and go eat here. Or just go and have a couple cocktails. You're wrong if you don't immediately close out of Yelp and book your reservation now. ***Happy hour note*** Tuesdays are $1 oysters all night. You can't complain when it's $1 oysters",
      "I absolutely loved this spot! First time ever coming here and the service was phenomenal.First, i had the special $1 oysters during happy hour which is during the hours of mon-sat and tuesdays is $1 oysters all day.After we tried the snapper which had this spice to it and can I say we had to order TWO more because it was that good.We got the Wagyu beef! Love the bread which matched perfectly with it. The little gem salad was 10/10, probably one of my favorite salads I've had thous far.Final entree, we got the Agnolotti, spicy rigatoni, bucatini.Agnolotti was my favorite, it had a sweet side to it and the stuffing inside was SOOOO YUMMY! Of course,  dessert I got the Foie Gras and can I say the lemon touch it had made it so much better.Overall my experience, was a 10/10! Everyone was very attentive and any thing that had to be changed was done with no issues.I will be back!!!",
      "Such a fun place to go with a group of friends! The vibe here is very cool. Came here with a few friends and arrived at 9 for our 9:15 reservation. Our table was taking a little longer than expected and they offered us some wine while we waited- so nice. The table took an extra 10 minutes or so, nothing too crazy. Once we were seated, we ordered a few drinks and some pastas to share. Drinks were amazing. Food was good. This is a great place to come and have some drinks and yummy food. I would just point out the place is fairly small so definitely keep that in mind if you plan on going with a larger group, it might be difficult to accommodate a larger group.",
      "I can't believe I just got to try Jaguar Sun! Everyone speaks so highly of this place and I finally got to see for myself.  It's such a beautiful place with nice decor'. I sat at the bar and really enjoyed the experience, service was great and we had a very enjoyable night.  Cocktails are definitely strong, i can't wait to stop by again.",
      "Highly recommend reservations! The ambiance is great for a date or dinner with friends. It's small and can get a little crowded near the bar but the dining room is nicely spaced.First time trying their corn filled agnolotti dish served with blue crab and it was PHENOMENAL. It's now my favorite pasta dish of theirs. The pappardelle with chicken in sugo verde is a close second. The menu options are just so well balanced. Full meal was the perfect mix of salt, fat, acid and heat. They do an incredible job!Service was great as usual. Can't wait to come back again! A true gem in Miami!",
      "This place gets it right every time. MartinisHouse RollsCesar SaladOystersHappy HourWhat more could you ask for? I consistently keep coming back here, time after time, after time. And I DEFINITELY plan to continue!!",
      "Reallllly enjoyed my experience at Jaguar Sun. My friends and I came during happy hour, so we were able to enjoy their deals. We got 3 dozen oysters ($1 each during happy hour) and a round of cocktails to start. We also wanted to try the Hokkaido Scallop appetizer which was SO GOOD! The Agnolotti with corn, crab, saffron was to die for. This is the one dish I will remember forever - amazing. We also got the parker house rolls, which were fresh and good.Will be back next time!",
      "It was my favorite cocktail bar during my recent visit to Miami. I loved the drinks (the flavor and value) and the ambiance. They were good quality cocktails around $15 and food was very reasonably priced (everything under $30) too. Unfortunately I didn't get to try the food but the drinks we got were great. The location is also very convenient for going out.I highly recommend!",
      "A piece of Manhattan in the middle of Miami.  I love this place because the bartenders are amazing and the drinks are delicious.   It's hard to find consistent good service in miami.  Before you had a chance to settle in your seat,  they bring water, menus, silverware.  So refreshing!   Amazing vibe, amazing service, amazing ambiance.  What's not to like?",
      "Mind blowing place for cocktails and food We visited Miami and reserve to visit this place Jaguar Sun The experience was fantastic, the food was delicious and the cocktails, THE COCKTAILS WERE OUTSTANDING. Cacio e Pepe was delicious and also their Cesar salad it's something out of this world, the beef tartar was super tasty and delicious. Fully recommended So happy to have been able to visit this place, food, ambient, cocktails, service"

I had a $6.44 discount on my order, and they refused to release my order to the DoorDash driver because it was more than a $5 discount. DoorDash was also no help in explaining this discount debacle.If you're going to try this place, perhaps go in person to avoid over an hour of time wasted waiting for your order (that they'll probably cancel on you if you have too much of a discount)",

The coffee tasted like burned and had some sediments in the bottom. The sandwich did not have the pork, the ham was sliced SUPER  thick, barely had cheese and the bread was not toasted. The pastelitos were mushy . I usually visit others palacio de los jugos and they are pretty consistent but here is another story .",

      "El Palacio has an impressive selection of Cuban food, fruit juices, and desserts! After hearing some good reviews, I decided to stop by this location for an early weekend lunch. There are a handful of tables outside for you to eat, but all meals are packaged in to-go containers. From chicharrones, ropa vieja, tostones -- they really have everything. My friend and I both got ropa vieja plates with yuca and mojo rice, as well as a couple croquetas. I'm not an expert with Cuban food, but I would highly recommend for the tenderness and flavor profile of the meat. The serving sizes are very generous; you'll have enough leftovers for another light meal. Our total for the food came out to $35 - $40. I also had their mango smoothie/juice, which was very sweet and refreshing. I'd like to try something else, but you aren't allowed to mix flavors!",
      "Great place for dinner with affordable portions and huge portion sizes! My friends and I got the chicken heart, goat, and lamb shank and they were all good, I really liked the yucca as well. Another thing that was amazing about this place was the fruit and the smoothies! For $5 each we got the smoothie with beets (I think it was the kidney cleanse) and the mango vanilla. Mixed together they were delicious!",

I explained that they should tell the customers because that was for a party and that maybe I could have had someone that was allergic to ham,  he proceeded to tell me , that when you have an allergy you're supposed to tell them  I agree but Imperial rice is made with chicken & yellow rice & cheese only  & spices no ham,   though they may use this method to save money , I believe the customers should warned that theirs is made with ham.",

The drinks were on point and so are the prices. Helps if you speak Spanish otherwise you're just going to be pointing. I have to go back everytime I go back to Miami. I can't stop thinking about this place, thats how good the food is. And get the vanilla custard and the fresh pressed juices.",

I ordered the oxtail but end up getting the chicken with salad and another side. I'm unsure what it was because it wasn't what I originally ordered but whatever it was... it was delicious. I also ordered the crispy pork... OMG it was bussin AKA so flavorful and the skin was chef's kiss! All my friends enjoyed their food. The portion was big and filling. I'd love to visit the actual restaurant next time. I'll definitely come back!"

      "Excellent food, lots of vegan and vegetarian options.   I think this is the former Bangkok City.  Prices are definitely more reasonably than other Thai restaurants nearby, even though it's in the Gables restaurant area.  Food is much better IMO.  Curries are tasty, we had red and green but not a heavy or thick as typical.  Green papaya salad is perfectly seasoned although I doubt it's really 100% vegan, I'll ask next time.  It's awesome and I don't really care if there's a little fish sauce in there. Seems like the owners are bringing Thai food into the healthier diet era but keeping the great traditional tastes.    My kids loved the \"chicken on a stick\"  satay and the sticky rice.    Traditional floor seating and table seating available, as well as outside terrace and takeout.  Go here, and tell me I'm wrong.",
      "We were in the mood to order Thai food and we hadn't in months and decided to give this a shot. We ordered shrimp massaman curry, drunken noodles and whole fried fish - little big man sauce. It arrived about 45 minutes after.Massaman was delicious and fragrant with lots of shrimp Whole fried fish was crispy, a lot of fish, super fresh and sauce reminded me of Thailand.Drunken noodles were delicious but could've had more noodles.Pretty good will try again!",
      "Highly highly recommend! The food here is the closest to actual authentic Thai food from Thailand! Their spicy is Asian spicy so be careful with the spice but it just hits the spot for me. Som Tum, Pad Khra Pao and pork egg noodles were absolutely full of flavors! Can't wait to go back there again.",
      "So I got the chive dumplings. I think that's what they're called. I loved them. They were extremely hot in temperature. Which I'm happy about because I ordered take out. Also ordered the duck basil. It was perfect. Right amount of seasoning and perfect skin texture on the duck. Definitely would order the same exact thing again next time I'm craving Thai.",
      "Tucked away in the Coral Gables miracle mile area, this spot brings traditional Thai culture and flavors to your dining experience. Passed through for an early dinner with one of my good friends. The service was friendly and the food was good. You might miss it if your not looking for it but worth a try if you're in the area and looking for Thai. Note: I started eating before I realized I had not taken a picture of the entrée. It was good.",
      "This is one of my favorite Thai restaurants in Miami because they offer authentic dishes that don't often pop up on menus in other Thai restaurants. Located on Giralda in Coral Gables, they have outside dining on the street, though the indoors dining room is beautifully decorated as well so it's hard to choose. I selected Kao Mun Kai, because I love this chicken dish so much I basically order every chance I get. This version does not disappoint - the rice is aromatic and the chicken tender. Kao Ka Moo is another popular Thai street food that is rarely offered in American Thai restaurants. The pork hock is flavorful and melt-in-your-mouth succulent. The portions are also very generous, we have enough leftover for another full meal.  Maybe the dishes we ordered are not the most common ones, it took a while for them to arrive, but the waiter was nice enough to keep us informed. There are many enticing dishes on the menu, so we'll definitely be back to explore more!!",
      "The food was so good, we forgot to take before pictures. We ordered the chicken pad Thai and beef yellow curry. Delicious. Also ordered the papaya salad (forgot the actual name), it was a bit spicy but we were warned of the spice. If you can't tolerate spice, do not get it !! Will be coming back !!",
      "We enjoy coming here to sit on the at the tables on the floor. My little one loves the chicken fried rice.  Khao Soy noddle soup is delicious!  It's a Thai curry with noodles, coconut milk, chicken, yellow curry. I added a bit of their chili oil to give it a little kick. Their plum wine is great as well. Jorge is a wonderful and attentive waiter who always comes around to check in on us and refill drinks. We'll be back!",
      "Man, I had high hopes for Khaosan after reading all the positive reviews. Not sure if we went on an off-night or something, but man, we were not impressed. Hate to knock the food bc the service was so good, but it's the truth :/ vibe was nice, love the outside seating at night, but food fell short overall.",
      "The basil duck is AMAZING! I also loved the Bangkok Bangkok fried rice; they need to add more shrimp but the flavors were good nonetheless. The ambiance is really rad (that's the best way to describe it); absolutely loved it! We had a great time and enjoyed the food. We will be back. Enjoy!",
      "Excellent! Flavorful! Delicious! We tore it up before taking photos since we ordered via Uber eats. Sorry! However, you won't regret this place. It's really amazing!  It's a must try and certainly worth endless repeats! Get extra dipping sauce for the spring rolls. The bangcock bankgcock fried rice is amazing, flavorful and on point! Best fried rice in Coral Gables. The pad see een with beef was a hit and a repeat for my cub.Looking forward to the next time. Enjoy!"

      "To be honest this place was kinda wack just over hyped and a cute place to take pics, drinks are ok but definitely look really good I'll give themPoints for presentation.Food was bad: the best part of my meal was I think some in house salsa verde and two fried eggsToo much and sort of lazy Reese's pancakes are just chopped Reese's cup (singular) on top and then pb and Nutella on top... just regular pancakesSo it's misleading ...Fruity pebbles French toastWith jam???no thanks it tasted like cinnamon and onceI got to the middle it was soggy, jam plus berries plus fruity pebbles not good too sweet and I have huge sweet tooth Really the only good partI took to go the sauceI ATE BC I WAS HUNGRY",
      "Mango Mimosa-5 stars they don't skimp on the champagne Shrimp stuffed avocado-4stars because where was the rest of our shrimp dish was packed with flavor feta cheese and guava sauce on the sideGuadalupe Omelette-4stars egg was slightly overcooked however the pulled pork and guacamole made up for the eggFruity pebble French toast3 stars- once I removed all the garnish and strawberry jelly it was good not to sweet with a little crunch Mocha latte- 3stars NUTELLA overkill even had Nutella on the handle not for me but if you love Nutella you'll enjoy this the actual latte inside was pretty goodServer was great explaining the menu",
      "Exquisite.From the service, to the food, to the colors on the well-decorated plates, this place was heaven on a Miami brunch afternoon.I went with a group and EVERYBODY thoroughly enjoyed the food and the service. I personally ordered the pancakes and they arrived well-decorated with the sweetest, fresh strawberries, a sprinkle of powdered sugar, and topped with a habiscus flower (edible, so I ate most of it).I will hunt this place down as a first stop, the next time that I'm in town.",
      "Decided to come here for brunch since the food and drinks looked amazing on Instagram. When we got there parking was a little tricky but eventually we found a spot (3$/hr). What I didn't realize is that they have valet parking for 5$ so I would recommend doing that instead! Once the entire party arrived (4 people) we were able to be seated, the waitress was super nice and attentive. When she gave us the menu (which is quite extensive) she recommended that we look on Instagram so we can visually see what the food looks like. I decided to get the smoked salmon sandwich which was literally amazing, I'm currently wishing I had one right now. My partner got the Nutella and fruit pancakes Which were also delish. Honestly, everyone loved their meal and the portions were generous. The drinks are funky and I love that they add a Popsicle to their mimosas. Reading some of the reviews I was a bit hesitant to come but I truly had a great experience here and can't wait to return. Side note: make sure your entire party is there at seating time because they will not seat you if everyone is not physically there.",
      "Wow! This place is the epitome of food heaven! Endless options to choose from! Our party decided to go with flavored popsicle drinks, cappuccinos, omelets, home fries, French toast,  and avocado toast.  Literally, everything tasted great.  Our server was super attentive and made sure that we had everything that we needed at all times. Yes, the wait to get inside is about an hour, however,  it's well worth it. This is a must whenever you're in the area.",
      "Ok; so this is your typical Miami over priced brunch spot great for Instagram pictures. Walk in put your name on the long list and proceed to wait outside or in your car. The line outside means nothing. Not really sure why people line up. Ok.... We get stayed, played a little musical chairs and finally get situated. The server the server the server... he was nice but for the money I'm paying I need recommendations on a platter. He was bland. Water for a table of 8 is a givenNext the drinks were good. Not great for the price... they were out of passion fruit, peach and something else. At this point just bring me a mimosa... (like I said bland). Apps we opted for the lobster avocado toast. 10/10 it was only 4 slices for a the price of $45.00. Damn $45 for an app. Anywho, the food come in large sizes so come hungry and be ready to have left overs that additionally always taste better. Bring your own candle or they will charge $10 dollars on some whip cream. Couldn't even make it nice for my daughters 18th birthday. But what does he care he was getting his gratuity either way based on our party size. Everyone had a little of everything and it was good. Won't complain about the food. Over prices but good none the less. I guess for the hype, I would go with 1 to 2 other people. 8 people later. Left a dent in my pocket and mediocre service and drinks. Wait the caramel latter with the cookie was unbelievable. Get it and thank me later.",
      "Very touristy? YesStill worth going? YesListen, I am the 1st person to avoid a tourist trap but this place is delicious and so casual for brunch. I loved it. They serve so many brunch choices from sandwiches, tacos, and pancakes. I am pretty sure they have what you are craving. I ordered the JQH (Jamon Queso Huevo Sandwich) and my goodness, it was huge and delicious. I recommend getting the fries--so crunchy and tasty. The only downfall of this place is their menu is a HOT MESS. I recommend you use their Instagram as the menu and order using the pictures. That is where I found all the items I ordered.Make sure to order at least one cocktail. They are tasty but the presentation is killer. I ordered the Pinita Picante Margarita and it was so good! P.S. They also have glitter lattes, which I found to be so fun. They do stain your mouth LOL"

      "such as cool rooftop with great cocktails. small hotel and elevator but gorgeous decor. great place to take photos",
      "Super cute ambiance! The building is truly adorable. The rooftop area is so well spaced and full of plants. It creates the perfect chill vibe. The views are okay -- since they do have a wall that goes around the perimeter so it causes a bit of an obstruction. Parking is very limited so bring a side of patience. When I went they had just opened back up again and had a very limited menu and no food. We tried some of their cocktails and everything was delicious. I would like to go again and give them a second chance so I can try more things and give a better more detailed review. The waitress was super kind!",
      "Ive been wanting to check out Terras for so long and finally had the chance to! The rooftop is great; spacious, cozy, has a beautiful view, music and thankfully it was not crowded on a thrusday night. To drink we had La rubia, the Sandia fresca and the Garden G&T. And to we eat we had Plantain chips, Queso fundido, Pollo tacos and Chicken Cubano. All good, almost too spicy, but good. Now the disappointing part. Service was pretty slow and as I said the place was not crowded at all. Many empty tables.As we were leaving, already downstairs, I realize I wanted to go to the ladies room. Saw one on the lobbe and while I was on my way to it, a hotel staff stopped me and told me I couldn't because that was a restroom only for guests. I mean... I just spent almost $200 in your rooftop and you won't let me use the bathroom? That was so rude and inconvenient. I ended up not going and left extremely irritated. Place is cute and all, but staff and service needs looooots of improvement.",
      "Amazing views of the Miami skyline and delicious cocktails! We came for drinks and appetizer and this place did not disappoint. Pretty full on a  Friday evening and service was a little slow but good. The guacamole was really really good and came with plantain chips which I love . One of my favorite drinks was the Maracuyá pisco, must have! I tried their water melon and Tito's recommended by the waitress but it was a little too sweet for me. If you can visit around sunset you'll love the view even more. Worth a visit! Ps: $15 bucks valet parking",
      "Beautiful rooftop bar in the middle of a quiet little Havana residential area. Awesome Miami views. Great drinks as well as food. Our server and bar tender were very attentive. Highly recommended!!!",
      "This is a true treasure hidden in Little Havana's residential area. The view and vibe is amazing, they had live house music on the Saturday night we attended. Even though it rained, there was plenty of space to hide under the cabana. The drinks were amazing, specially crafted. The bar staff is friendly and willing to answer any questions. This place never gets too packed which is nice. Did not try any food.",
      "So glad they're back open! This is one of my favorite rooftops in Miami. The cocktails, the view, the music... it's always great. My only gripe is that parking in the area is awful. Strongly recommend ubering!",
      "I love Terras from the moment I went. It was a night out with my friends and the music and the cocktails were amazing. I mean we had a blast. The djs are really good and you can dance all night long whole looking towards Brickell skyline, its amazing.Came for HH and cant say the same thing, we got overcharged for a miscommunication from the server on which were the HH drinks, the food was mediocre, it was not a good experience. But for night time I do recommend",
      "I'd read about Terras a few times, so decided to finally check it out. It's a rooftop hotel bar in Little Havana with a nice view of the Miami skyline. We got there around 5:45 p.m. on a Saturday, which was the perfect time to snag a table. By the time we left at 7:30, they were pretty slammed though. As for drinks, I ordered the Sandia Fresca cocktail (Tito's vodka, watermelon, purple basil, lime), which was just okay. It tasted really watered down and at $14 wasn't worth it. Needless to say, I didn't order another drink.My mans got the birria tacos, which were absolutely awful. Our friend called called it a crime to even serve something like that. Three terribly tiny tacos with a side of broth. At $15, it was truly embarrassing. Maybe that's why I didn't even bother with a photo?Our friend ordered the crispy maitake mushrooms and the frita burger, which he said were great. He also opted for the Guavaloma cocktail (mezcal, guava grapefruit syrup), which was pretty good too.Service was prompt and friendly, so no complaints there. Parking is a mission because the 5-spot parking lot is for hotel guests only, so we had to park a couple of blocks down and walk.Overall, charming spot with nice service, but not a place I ever see myself coming to again.",
      "Very cute rooftop in the middle of Little Havana! The hotel it is at is also very cute and looks almost out of place it this residential section. I only had drinks when I went so I cant speak for the food, but the place had great music and great ambiance! While it was a fun time and I had a good time, theres also some cons to Terras. I highly suggest taking an Uber because the parking is terrible and the neighborhood isn't the greatest to be honest. Also since the place is small, you may be asked to wait at lobby for a while, which kind of annoying if you ask me bc there's no bar/entertainment down there. Lastly I feel like the drink prices are a little on the pricey side for the area."

      "Exceptional fried chicken, I had the lil hottie, a basic sandwich on a bun with hot sauce, juicy fried chicken pickles, and cole slaw.My group also ordered chicken nuggets- juicy and delicious and plain fries. All were cooked fresh came out hot and hit the spot. Coop is located in a trendy food court noisy and vibrant great place for lunch in upbeat atmosphere.",
      "This place is located in the MIA Market food hall, in the Miami design district. I went into this area for the first time today. I was hungry and thought I'd check out this food hall. I saw that all vendors here are Chef driven. I chose to go with Cajun fries from this place and other stuff from another place. These should be the one of the best fries I have ever eaten. The fries are crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. They are seasoned generously. The service is good and the ambiance of this food hall is great as well. Highly recommend this place, I also heard that their fried chicken is very good!!",
      "5 star food 5 star service 5 star ambience.  Really amazing twists on classic fried chicken dishes served with a smile in probably Miami's most glamorous food hall.5 star food:  I grew up in the Deep South so know my fred chicken, and was expecting a sort of hipster version to not be very good.  The fried chicken here is off da' charts good, with some sort of alchemy between the breading and the frying that makes it among the best I've ever had.  If you get the fried chicken wrap and a Diet Coke, you can tell yourself the minimal bread and sugar makes up for the fried part.5 star service:  The staffers were incredibly nice and even read out all the fine print on the overhead menu since I had forgotten my glasses. The gal behind the counter had a funny conversation with me about her very cool mod 60s head scarf, and the guy who brought the food must have stopped by 4-5 times to be sure if we needed anything.5 star ambience:  I really love MIA Market, the food hall for Miami Design District.  They get everything just right, from the variety of the food shops to the whole vibe of the place.",
      "Considering the location and how much I had to go through to get to the store this place just didn't do it for me. The chicken was average and my salad wasn't much for the price. I feel like I got a small side order of leaves as a garnish to my chicken breast. I ordered the chicken salad and it was just more chicken breast with sprinkles of a salad. It's Just not hitting the Mark for me. Don't think I will revisit.",
      "Mediocre chicken sandwich. Great onion rings.  Fast service. I keep a spreadsheet of fried chicken sandwiches. As a Bay Area Native I have a lot of exposure to great chicken sammie options and I would say the lil hottie doesn't even rank above a Popeye's which is my standard for a basic.It seems like they use a little breast piece for the sandwich - so the chicken is pretty dry and ratio wise a small portion of the sandwich. Their hotsauce is something like Tobasco- Acidic in profile. The flavor of the buns is nice and sweet but overall the sandwich lacks the crispy/juicy balance (more mushy) and the hot/cold balance - I ate it on the spot and it was lukewarm all around. The onion rings however were hot and ultra crispy- and it's nice that it comes as a little serving. Given that it's in a food court, I would venture elsewhere if a group chose to eat here.",
      "Ambiance: I loved this indoor market, full of many different options. I chose COOP for its fried chicken nuggets and also added the secret sauce . Staff was super cool, kind, friendly.Food: I recommend the nuggets! But then when has frying something ever gone wrong?",
      "Crunchy and moist..... need I say more. This is one of the best fried chicken you'll find in town. Located in beautiful MIA Market in the Design District you really cant go wrong with this southern bird!My husband I tried their signature fried chicken and chicken and waffles.  Perfection!! Portions are decent, they will definitely leave you you full. My only complaint is that it's a little pricey for what it is.",
      "My husband ordered fried chicken sandwich with Cajun onion rings here. He's very happy with both of the two items. I tried the onion rings which are very delicious, so crunch and strong Cajun flavor. I see this is a very popular spot in the food hall.",
      "I absolutely love the food here. I stopped in earlier today and ordered the chicken sandwich and pink lemonade. The pink lemonade was literally the best I've ever had! The chicken sandwich was delicious and tasted as though it was made with Tabasco sauce but it wasn't too spicy. I recommend this place to anyone who's looking for an amazing meal in Miami!",
      "This is in the food hall in the Design District. There are a ton of good options in here, and this is definitely one of them. These aren't your average chicken nuggets; the seasoning is unique and really good. There's almost something sweet to them thats hard to describe. Big portions and the nuggets are super crispy. The Cajun fries were good too. Definitely a bit of a kick to them"

      "- Very cute new place, I like the pokemon toys in the front (wish I could take one)- The dishes are beautifully displayed- Their signature corral chicken yaki soba is so amazing. It looks good and tastes good. The chicken was nice and crispy.- I would only be wary that their portions are on the smaller side- The waitress spent a couple of minutes asking what I wanted to order in the beginning and still got my order wrong when it came out. It didn't seem very difficult because they had a picture of the corral chicken soba on their menu and I just pointed to it. That was kind of annoying.- I'm curious to try some of their other items",
      "This normally wouldn't be on my radar but I figured I try it out since I live near it. The only reason is there's just a lot of solid Asian options near here and there's never anyone there which is a red flag. I ordered takeout the other night craving noodles and tried their popular Chicken Yakiudon. You'd think it's a full proof dish. It's essentially stir fry with a modified teriyaki based sauce. Boy was I wrong. They messed up Yakiudon. It was lacking everything except the chicken and udon. The color was this ugly dark brown with no vegetables and no color. The sauce was very forgettable and the udon was bordering on overcooked mushy. It's honestly a train wreck and I wouldn't feed it to the nearby homeless.",
      "I had an amazing experience at the restaurant! The food was delicious and authentic, and the service was top-notch. The decor was also beautiful and added to the overall ambiance of the dining experience. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a great meal and excellent service.",
      "Only one thing would have made this five stars... a bib! With all the slurping of the delicious noodles and sauces, I left with a shirt that looked like I had been out playing paintball. The portions are spectacularly oversized and can easily be shared. Our server was extremely attentive and personable, if you love noodles, you won't be disappointed with this restaurant.",
      "I went to Udon with friends for dinner, we were excited to try out this new spot knowing it is very popular in Spain! We ordered the Chicken & Pork Gyozas which were great as well as the Takoyaki which I had never tried before. The Pork Buns were good as well but what we were most looking forward to was the Noodle dishes and we were very disappointed. I ordered the Corral Chicken Yaki Udon and the chicken was good but the sauce on the noodles was not good, it was overly salty & had a strange taste. My boyfriend got the Beef Yaki Udon and agreed that while the noodles themselves were good the sauce was nothing extraordinary and the beef didn't seem like the best quality. If you're going to try Udon I'd stick to ordering just tapas.",
      "Very nice friendly restaurantFood was good. Services was fast and very cordial.  Will visit it again",
      "Worst ramen I ever had in my life and I've had plenty!!! Only thing that tasted good was the meat but I had to put loads of table salt to barely enjoy it. If you want good ramen, go to GO BISTRO around the corner!",
      "I should've turned around when I saw how empty it was inside. The pork bun gets a 4/5 and I enjoyed their use of noodles for their sushi rolls, although I probably wouldn't look for it when I'm craving sushi. The negima was so dry.. I didn't even know chicken thighs could get that dry. Yakisoba was worse than the instant ones we can get at Publix and we ordered a ramen egg and got a straight up hard boiled egg. Definitely not worth 90$. I still give it a solid 3 stars because the tapas were decent, our server was nice, and the restaurant is pretty. Maybe just don't call yourselves noodle experts so that the noodles don't underwhelm your customers.",

Our waiter, i believe his name is Allen was so friendly! He recommended some beers for us to try and really made my night better. The service was 10/10.

I usually need to ask for extras, but this was a lot and just right!Really soft bun too.Very big highlight here? That Fish Dressing! Oh my it was just amazing! I asked for it on the side, and could have had it just plain too!For my side I got the cauliflower mash. It was a really generous amount, right amount of softness and cheesiness too, and overall really good. Tiny bit on the salty side, but still good.I ordered my fiancé the Frita By Kush (burger with Guava Jelly, Potato Six, Bacon, Swiss Cheese and LoKal Sauce). I didn't bet a chance to try it, but he said it was really good too!",
      "I had high expectations for this restaurant as I've eaten at other Kush restaurants before and the food has always been good. However, kush by spillover did not impress me at all. The food was definitely lacking! I tried the frito pie which I found to be very salty and barely had Fritos. Next, I had  the tortilla soup which was honestly terrible. I would not consider that a soup but rather refried beans that should be eaten as a dip (see picture). We also had the Baja fish tacos which were mediocre, not bad but were missing a sauce.I can't complain about the oysters as they were good! Overall, I was not happy with this kush restaurant and would not go back or recommend to anyone. They have some work to do to be at the same level of the other Kush restaurant locations.",
      "I'd like to give them a 3.5 really. Mostly because the service was outstanding and the buffalo snapper bites were great. I grouper rueben was good. The local fish sandwich lacked flavor and oddly enough the bread on the crispy chicken sandwich came out soggy. I think the menu items can be hit or miss. But I'd go back to try some different items."

When we visited for lunch there was a table of 5 young men sitting next to us taking tequila shots and they were very loud and we couldn't really enjoy ourselves. I had the fajita and it did not have any flavor and the vegetables were over cooked so much that it was a paste. They served me two large shrimp and the rest were the size of my finger nail (like cheap Chinese rice shrimp). The chicken nor the steak had any flavor.",

Looking over the menu I noticed that they have a large variety of different tacos to choose from. I chose 5 different ones, Carnitas, Pastor, Chicken, Barbacoa, and Chorizo. I was no disappointed by a single taco,  the seasoning was great on each and every one. Its a legit Mexican restaurant with Authentic and great tasting food.",

      "What an amazing spot, we absolutely LOVED it. It's fairly young and trendy, so I would not take my baby boomer parents here (or a baby in general)- but for a younger, fun, lively crowd, this is perfect. The inside is really cool - lots of artwork, somewhat hidden restaurant, similar to a speakeasy. The drinks were unique and incredible and the food was OUTSTANDING! Very gastronomic - if you're into that sort of thing (my parents wouldn't get it). We basically ordered the entire menu, until we nearly exploded. Here were a few memorable plates (as in, those I can remember after imbibing for a few hours)...Spanglish milk bread - the black salt on top. WOW. They say, once you go black (salt), you never go back right? Exactly. The guava butter was unlike any butter I have ever had. It's very tropical, and fruity! Wagyu beef ravioli - that blue cheese sauce was to die for - take some of that milk bread and drunk your bread in this sauce to your heart's desire (and worry about the consequences later, because bread and cheese, whew!) Nitro Watermelon Tataki - the only remotely healthy thing that entered our mouths at dinner. It's such a cool fish - watermelon, pomegranate seeds, toasted pumpkin seeds, olive oil and a total flavor overload. Not to mention the fact that the fish came out looking like sashimi grade tuna. So cool. Arroz Mamposteado - this was a cool fish. It was rice and beans, but mixed with avocado creme and and pork belly and chips. Incredible. I'm not much of a dessert but holy smokes did we devour the suspiro. I'm quite positive I licked the jar towards the end of the evening - don't judge me. I wish I could remember what cocktail I had, but the choices are all so unique and fun, I should have tried them all. Eh, gives me a reason to go back, right?!",
      "Thank you so much for the kind words and the detailed review of all of our dishes, Shannon.  It was a pleasure hosting you, and we look forward to your next visit!",
      "Obsessed is an understatement.Found this place on Yelp (I love you Yelp!) and with the rating and images I knew I was SOLD. The show stopping, craft cocktails is what I came for and I wasn't sure what to expect once we came. Was it a hype? Would I be disappointed? Who cares! You're in Miami and going to a Spanglish cocktail bar. We didn't make reservations but we did read it wasn't too hard to get in. And it was exactly just that. Came here at around 9:30 pm on a Saturday night and we were seated to the side entrance table with couches right away. It wasn't a good option for dining but we literally only came here for the cocktails so it was perfect!The vibe check in this place was everything. There was a live dj tucked in to the side making sure the music was on point. And it was!On to the craft cocktails:I ordered the Pornstar Mejican@ and it was delicious wish the mezcal was more of the star of the show and to be honest, given that everyone else's cocktails were truthfully visually so pleasing wish the presentation for this one was as well but that's totally ok!!! I still loved my experience. My hubby ordered the Cafetera Old Fashioned and WOW. What a presentation and fun way to serve it with an actual cafetera. It was definitely a show stopper. The Caipirinha Frizá was delicious and very unique as well and the Paparazzi came served in a photo lens so that was pretty cool!We loved Spanglish, would be back in a heart beat. Overall great vibes for cocktails and pretty cool presentation that really makes this place stand out. Excited to try their food next time!",
      "This place gives my New York Vibes OD! It's definitely giving New York Speakeasy Vibes. You'll probably miss it if your not paying attention because the sign outside is only a neon bottle sign. Inside is intimate with the cutest decor, low key, playing all the classic jams. I love a place that sets a vibe with an good playlist! Okayyy! We came for drinks after dinner, so we didn't order food but they did have a menu. All the drinks we ordered were sooo freakin good, and were in creative instagram worthy cups. This is definitely going to be my new hideaway spot. Service was amazing! Will be coming back!",
      "Okay, here's the thing with this place, it's so freaking loud that you can barely hear the person next to you, it's impossible to have any sort of conversation with a large group of people. The food was okay and drinks were pretty good on the other hand, so I think this is a good place for dates, just not a large gathering.",
      "Hi Anton, thank you so much for taking the time to share your experience at Spanglish.  We apologize for the music being too loud, and this is something we’re going to adjust.  Although, we’re happy to hear you enjoyed the drinks!We hope to see you again soon!",
      "What an awesome chic place.  Amazing craft cocktail & gastro pub style tapas.

      "The entrance to Spanglish is so subtle that it's easy to miss! Once you enter, the ambiance is cozy, intimate, and welcoming. We came because of the happy hour -- their cocktails were $9 and some small dishes were marked down! We ordered a round of the caipirinhas first and sadly were a bit disappointed, it was way more tart than expected and just tasted like lemon juice. The Chilcano tasted similar with the overpowering citrus. The Spanglish mule was way better! For small plates, we ordered the octopus croquettes, Caribbean dumplings, and a side of yuca. The octopus croquettes were my favorite of the items we ordered -- crispy, served hot, and the octopus inside was tender. The Caribbean dumplings were a little mushy, and the yuca was a bit tough and the sauce it was served with tasted like Big Mac sauce which I am not a fan of. Everything came out pretty fast, though!",
      "Finally got to visit Spanglish and let's just say I fell in love! I came here for happy hour with a friend and honestly we were blown away by how delicious everything was. We ordered the Spanish Milk Bread, Timba Frita, Queso E' Craba , and Tuna Tostadas. My favorite dish we tried was the Timbra Frita. It was the perfect bite full of flavor. We also ordered cocktails. We both ordered the Paparazzi which honestly tasted amazing but the presentation was killer. It comes served in a camera lens. Overall this place is a vibe. The music was lit. They were playing bad bunny. The artwork is awesome. I definitely see myself coming back here.",
      "Location a bit hidden in plain sight, so be sure to stop and read signs. Small  and intimate setting with a great ambiance for drinks and light bites with friends. The food was ok nothing over the top or extraordinary. I did like my margarita with the seafood bites. Drinks here before a walk around in Wynwood is never a bad idea.",
      "This place has no sign in front. We drive up and down and finally found it. Outside looks like it was closed. Nothing indicating it was opened except for a sign out front that shows menu of the day. We walked it and surprisingly was like wow. This is a cute small cozy restaurant.  The booth I say were pretty close to one another.  The bar area has 6 stools. The food was excellent! Extremely flavorful and so good. The octopus appetizer was amazing. We ordered one of their popular dish and weren't disappointed.  I forgot to photo that dish because I was so hungry.  Everything we had was great including the drinks. We love craft drinks and for sure it was super crafty. The paparazzi drink was so cute. It came in a camera cup and tasted great.I would be definitely coming back here again soon and recommend everyone to try if you haven't been here.",
      "Came here to try a few drinks on a Friday night and it wasn't as busy as I expected. I was able to sit at the bar and watch the bartender make these really cool looking and tasty drinks! The paparazzi was my favorite. Something about the dill and passion fruit combination was something I didn't know I needed. The vuela paloma was just okay, I'm just not the biggest fan of grapefruit. And the cafetera old fashioned tasted like a REALLY strong Cuban coffee, which I really enjoyed. Although the drinks were great, the vibe was kinda ruined by these drunk idiots sitting next to us at the bar, yelling and screaming. But I would still come here again to enjoy a cool curated cocktail."

      "Seaspice was amazing. It's a fantastic restaurant with a great view right on the Miami River. If you don't right you can catch the live music as the sun sets, and the restaurant transforms to a lounge. Totally worth coming Parking is tricky, and if you're not paying attention you might miss it as you drive by. But it's a gem worth coming back to.",
      "Seaspice is known to Miami locals as a very high end resturant, frequented by celebrities.  I have no idea why.  The service is pretty awful.  The drink runners are horrible.  It takes about 30 minutes for just a drink to be brought out to you.  The food is mediocre.  It is definitely NOT worth the price, which is very expensive.  I am giving two stars because the view is amazing.  Seaspice is right on the water and has a gorgeous ambiance.  You can watch yachts drive by and some will even pull up and park.  The other star is for the tres leches.  This dessert was AMAZING, I would go back just to eat it again.  But otherwise, Seaspice is nothing special.  Save your money.",
      "A place that tries to be high end but fails to deliver.Service ? Mediocre Food ? Below parFirst thing when you check in is they tell you that you have a 2 hr max(tacky)",
      "I read this was one of the best patio dining AND a hot spot for celebrities in Miami, so I had to go check it out on our recent travels to this area...Initially I was worried about our luggage situation, as we had to carry our luggage to the restaurant since this was our last stop in Miami. However, they were very accommodating, and let us store some of our stuff in the closet, and we kept the big luggage with us, near our table.As expected, the patio scene was spectacular...city skyline and seaside views, with plenty of yachts passing by! The place indeed had that chic celebrity vibe...truly FAB! Loved the music overhead as well. Somehow, I expected some snobbiness...but not at all. Service was great!Then the food. OMFG...I've had some amazing foods lately, but this takes the cake. Even the complimentary bread was amazing (and unique)! My husband ordered this Wagyu Burger, and I chose this Ragu Pappardelle ( THE best Ragu Pappardelle I've ever had...EVER. ). Then this Pavola dessert...again, just beyond delish. Truly, this was foods for the celebrities.Honestly, I'm shocked at how low the rating is for this place. I assume that if the service isn't top notch, it would probably piss some folks off. The pricing was on the outlandish side...with even lunch entrees starting at around 40. There was even an appetizer item priced at around 70 bucks! Luckily, like I said, I felt that the foods and the service (and especially the spectacular ambiance) made up for it. There was this big yacht parked right near us, which somewhat blocked some of the views from the left. Still, we got our eyeful of seaside/yachtside views.In any case, this was a great way to end our trip in Miami.",
      "Went here with a group of girlfriends for brunch and everything was delicious, they were super accommodating as well.I had the froze , a cucumber and gin cocktail and 2 grey goose and sodas and all were fantastic.As a table we split the fresh fish and a couple sides and it was delicious. Also love the free bread It is definitely on the pricier side overall tbh but great for a fun \"fancy\" brunch",
      "Came here for Miami spice and although we spent more than we thought we would, we had a good time. Everything was delicious. The kale Caesar had pecans and Granny Smith apple slices, never had a Caesar like this but it was a nice change! The Shrimp Pesto Whole Wheat Spaghetti was my favorite, even though I'm not the biggest fan of pesto. The burger was good too just a little messy from the truffle aioli. The chocolate cremoso and tres leches was very good but I'd go with the cremoso for the cocoa nib crumble, yum! All in all, I think it's overpriced and I probably won't come here again because of that. The cheapest bottle of Chardonnay was $75 and most drinks were $20. I only came here for Miami spice and still spent almost $200.",
      "Given we still have Miami Spice going on until the end of the month we decided to try out the lunch menu @ Seaspice gorgeous location on the Miami River, sitting outdoor is really relaxing, so beautiful to watch the boats go by, really lovely To start we had the Comte' Cheese Soufflé, I have to admit this was a bit disappointing, it really did not have the texture of a real soufflé  but then............ the Shrimp Pesto Whole Wheat Spaghetti and the Pan-Seared Chilean Seabass were really good as dessert, both the Tres Leches and the Chocolate Cremoso were yummy Try it out before Miami Spice ends, you can check out the Miami Spice Menus on miamiandthebeaches.com@seaspicemia",
      "First time for me at Seaspice, it is located on the banks of the Miami River it is a gem that you should not miss. Sit outside in the courtyard enjoy your food and a drinks while watching the boats go by, just beautiful We had the Miami Spice lunch which has a very affordable fix price 3 course menu for $ 28, unfortunately this will end soon, nevertheless, I would defiantly go back again for sureRegarding the Miami Spice menu only one observation, they should have had more than one choice for the Entrees without the extra charge, right now you have 4 choices and 3 of these have extra charge on it, not really fair given that you are promoting the Spice menu, you should have at least two or three choices included in the price and one or two with the extra charge We had had Prince Edward Island Mussels, Grilled, the Grilled Faroe Island Salmon and the Profiteroles and Peaches and Cream. My favorite where the Mussels, the garlic pizza bread they brought for the table was absolutely delicious, the Salmon was good too. I had the Peaches for dessert and it was ok, not really my thing, my friend said the Profiteroles were great, next time I will not opt for the healthy dessert We enjoyed all with a good Albariño wine, our experience was made especially enjoyable by our waiter Fabrizio, he was really great ! Thank you Fabrizio @seaspicemia",
      "Bad first impression. Its not a nice feeling to feel like you have to beg to spend your money at a restaurant. Every year I look forward to Miami Spice. It's a great way to try out various restaurants and a unique spread of menu options. Seaspice was on my radar and happened to be one of the participating restaurants offering the Miami Spice menu. I contacted the restaurant in advance and made a reservation for 3:30p for a party of four. My mom who is from out of town was excited to join us for lunch. I advised the restaurant we were doing the Miami Spice menu. The restaurant made it clear that they charge $50pp for No Shows. At 3:15pm, we arrived for our reservation. The hostess Karin greeted us, and advised us that they were running behind on the reservations and because of this they will not be able to offer the Miami Spice menu. Only the a la-carte menu will be offered. This was a bit upsetting because we drove almost an hour to get there and the restaurant is refusing to offer the Miami Spice promotion. Our natural instinct was to just say forget it we will go somewhere else. I mean, at the end of the day who wants to beg to spend their money? It's absurd. If the restaurant is offering a promotional menu and because to no fault of our own they are running behind why should we be penalized?My Mom looked so bummed out. Because she was so excited to try this place. I decided to walk back in and ask for a Manager. The Manager took 20min to come out. When he finally did come over, he introduced himself as Collin. I explained to him what was going on and it seemed as though he wasn't aware that the hostesses were turning Miami Spice customers away. He decided to make it right and advised Karin to honor the Miami Spice menu. Impressive! Things were turning around. Besides the encounter at the hostess stand, the restaurant is beautiful. It is situated on Miami's waterfront were you can view the million dollar yachts passing by. They also have docks for those interested in docking and dining. You can view the downtown city skyline which I am sure looks amazing at night.The food was excellent. The Miami Spice menu offered a three course lunch for $28. You have the choice of a starter (Kale Salad, Cheese Souffle, or White Gazpacho). A choice of entrees (Seabass, Chicken Breast, Shrimp Pesto Pasta, Wagyu Burger, or Plant Bowl). And a choice of dessert (Tres Leches or Chocolate Cremoso). They also offer the option to add a Glass of wine for and additional $12. I ordered the Comte Cheese Souffle, the Green Circle Farms Chicken Breast, and the Tres Leches. The others in my party ordered the Kale Salad, Gazpacho, and Seabass. For starters, My favorites were the Kale Caesar Salad and Cheese Souffle. The Kale Caesar had a mix of shredded Granny Smith apples, pecans and a creamy Caesar dressing. The cheese Souffle was like a fluffy egg Souffle with a cream parmesan sauce and tomato chutney. Delicious!For entrees, both the Seabass and Chicken breast were amazing. The Chicken breast was tender and juicy, served on top of a creamy polenta and topped with corn, peas, and mushrooms. The seabass was seared nicely to give a nice crunch on the outside, while perfectly flaky and moist on the inside. It was served with stewed garbanzo, Swiss chard, and smoked potato. For desserts, we all had Tres Leches. It was served in a small Mason jar topped with 3 milks, and berries. Perfect way to end the meal. The portions are not large but it is filling. The flavors are fresh and very well balanced. The food presentation was notable. The Watermelon Tequila drink was delightful and refreshing. The froze was also a big hit. The cocktails were presented well and created perfectly. We enjoyed everything. Our waiter, Austin was very friendly. He made great recommendations and was very attentive.An 18% gratuity was added to the tab. There are lots of street parking accessible. In the end, the food was great. Ambience was amazing. The hostesses can use additional customer service training and learn to use better judgment to improve the customers experience. There was no need to escalate the matters to a manager. It could have been handled properly by showing empathy, apologizing, and finding a solution to the problem.",
      "Hi Kim,Thank you for dining with us and leaving a detailed review. It has been forwarded to our management team. Our apologies for the confusion at the door.  Glad to hear Collin accommodated you and your experience was turned around.  We are happy to see your great feedback regarding the food, cocktails, and Austin’s Service.  Hopefully you will join us again in the near future!",
      "This is my second time going to sea spice & I normally love it as the first time. I never leave bad reviews But this second time MY PHONE WAS STOLEN AND SECURITIES DID NOThing about it. Instead we're trying to blame me for the situation. I'm not drunk nor was drunk. I walked in with 2 phone and walked out with 1.We came as my friend USUALLY does and this is how they treated us  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME. I thought it was 5 star so nothing could go wrong. With a security right next to our table my phone STILLL got stolen. It was on the table. And to whoever has the time to steal phones is just sad imagine what else they can steal... I wil ask to review cameras but with the way I was treated when I let them know I lost my phone I doubt they will be helpful but I'll let every platform form of review know that they steal phones here. I know the exact time frame as well so they wouldn't even have to look much at the cameras. Let's see. BTW I BEEN HOME SICK AFTER EATING THESE OYSTERS I COULDNT Even celebrate my baby's birthday w him.",
      "Came here for my birthday dinner with my boyfriend for a 7:15 reservation (we called in advance for an outdoor seat dock side) we waited about ten minutes after our arrival for our table to be ready at the bar, the short wait was definitely worth it. Started with an aperol spritz at the bar then ordered octopus and gazpacho to start. Octopus portion was good but the olive oil tasted burnt since it came out on a sizzling hot cast iron looking skillet (its very easy to overcook octopus, please just bring a regular plate next time.) I also had the whole main lobster. Extremely delicious large portion of perfectly cooked and seasoned lobster, bravo. My boyfriend had the truffle coated Chilean sea bass and he absolutely loved it. Vibe: 5/5 this place definitely is a scene but not overwhelmingly pretentious or obnoxious. Absolutely loved the music as well. Service:3/5 A bit slow, our server was very attentive when we were able to get his attention but we had to always wave him down. Food: 4/5 everything was honestly pretty good (octopus could've had a bit more attention to detail)",
      "Hi Liz,Thank you for celebrating your birthday with us!  We are so happy to hear you had a great experience and enjoyed the food.  Your feedback regarding the octopus has been sent to our chef. We look forward to seeing you again soon!"

Incredible. - Tiramisu OMG - get it. - Tableside Caesar - Very nice server - Ben - Foccacia bread The good: - Meatball App - The wine cellar and steak presentation as you walk in is a nice touch General feedback: - Dimming the lights a bit more would give it some real ambiance and a homier feel  - They JUST opened so cut the staff some slack. I've been on a team opening a restaurant before and it's so hard. They did great! - Good location - easy access with ample parking. A local steakhouse is just what the neighborhood needs - The staff was really sweet and everyone was really working hard all night.",
      "Went here for a birthday dinner. They have a great menu with all sorts of selections.  Our waiter was pushy and rude.  We ordered a NY Strip, Branzino, Pasta Bolonaize, Filet Minan, truffle fries and salad.  The steaks were ordered medium well done.  All the food was good except the steaks.  They kept bringing back the steaks rare and the waiter was angry with nasty comments toward us.  If you go here avoid this guy.  We told the mgr who seemed surprised.",
      "The staff and Marco was amazing! The food, absolutely Devine, the portion the flavor, the attention to detail were all perfection. Thank you for making my husband's 40th bday so memorable.",
      "Hello my name is Nick. Of course I'm from New York. I usually don't write reviews specially bad ones we got to this nice restaurant very gorgeous inside. The bread was delicious. I have to say the first course was a pasta dish we split. It had a Bolognese sauce on it it was served hot and good. Little did I know that was the highlight of a dinner. My steak came out first they cut it up which I wasn't crazy about but it was cold. my friends ordered a veal dish a special order. They accommodated them but the dish also was ice cold. The dish presentation was very nice but it being cold was definitely a problem. I must mention the sides to twice cook baked potato was a baked potato not twice cooked. The cream spinach was nice fresh baby spinach sautéed with melted cheese on top. The menu, said cream of spinach. I do wish they would get their act together, and I would even consider trying it again. The Decour is very elegant. It was Christmas Eve. We got there at 6:15 and it wasn't that busy. There was no excuse for the cold food. I must say I was very disappointed. My name is nick hogan.",

      "Ridiculous prices for a basic Italian restaurant It will never make it in NMB Will not bring lunch customers at this prices Dinner customers will go to a well known reliable restaurant",
      "My boyfriend and I had been waiting for what felt like an eternity for this place to open because we love Frank so we had to check out a place named after his iconic song. Just like his song, our experience was great! The place feels intimate and has a great ambiance for a date night. The food was also incredible! Yet, the best part was the service. Our server Andrea was so sweet and helpful the entire night. I highly recommend!",

      "Perfect place for date night! The food was amazing and the staff very friendly and attentive. Can not go wrong with the BURRATA CAPRESE for starter and my favorite the FILETTO DI MANZO! So many tasty options can't wait to go back next time I am in town!"

      "The place is right in the heart of Coral Gables, has a nice offer of american food with good quality ingredients. They do have outdoor seatings, one the few place that still have. The indoor is nice but too cold, there are certain tables under the A/C that might make your stay a bit uncomfortable but nothing terrible.We got a complimentary tres leches dessert and it was delicious, for real.

      "The shaved brussels sprouts salad with salmon is one of my favorite salads ever, so when I got a craving for it I came in for dinner. This Doc B's was only about half full on a Friday evening, so a reservation wasn't really necessary. My salad was delicious as usual. I order mine with salmon, which was cooked excellently. The food came out quickly and the service was fine. I'll be back when the craving calls again!",
      "I'm SO happy to report that Doc B's is back to being on my hit list! After a few bad moments, I went back not once, but TWICE in a week because it was THAT good. Out waitress that first day was great! Daisy was new but she was so sweet & super attentive. I had the \"The Number Six\" chicken sandwich BOTH TIMES, because again... it was THAT good! Some other highlights were the cocktails (Internal Affair for the WIN!), the \"Mediterranean Hummus\" (my Egyptian boyfriend swore it was incredibly authentic, including the incredible puffed pita), the \"Perfect House Salad\" (truly perfect!), & their french fries were to die for! Absolutely a fan again!",
      "I've had a rollercoaster relationship with Doc B's since it opened a few years ago. At first, I was obsessed. So obsessed in fact, I used to eat there at least once a week. After about 2 years, the quality started slipping & my favourite dishes began disappearing from the menu. Then i started having bad experiences with food there until I gave up on it completely. Then, during the lockdown, I discovered their Ahi Tuna Salad & began ordering from them again. Fast forward to earlier this week when my boyfriend & I were looking for a yummy dinner as it was his last night in town. Decided to go with Doc B's because honestly, Luca is closed on Mondays. We walked over & arrived about 10 minutes before our reservation. The waitress was nice enough but when she walked us to our table, it was legit like 15 feet away from the entrance to the restaurant & other diners. I made s joke about the distance & she asked if i wanted her to move the table closer. \"No worries, just hope the waiter can find us!\", I joked. Little did I know how on point i was. 15 minutes later, no one had come by to even offer us water. Instead of letting someone know, we decided to cut our losses & go somewhere else. Good choice considering we landed at Zucca & had one of the BEST meals I've had in awhile. Hope Doc B's finds it's way back to its former glory & brings back its \"Not Your Mama's Tuna Sandwich\" while they're at it.",
      "I'm someone who eats by cravings. If i get a hankering for something, i literally will not eat unless it's THAT THING. I know, i know... annoying so imagine living like this. Anyways, today the only thing i wanted for dinner was Hillstone's Ahi Tuna Salad. It had been months since I had it & it was all or nothing. I excitedly logged into the site to order takeout & lo & behold, they had removed it from their limited menu. I was devastated & soooo very hungry! I started looking around and discovered that Doc B's had a very similar item. Their \"The #1 Tuna Salad\" (seared ahi with citrus ponzu alongside field greens, cucumber & mango in a carrot ginger dressing) sounded good but i had had some not so great experiences last year so was hesitant. My craving was not letting up so i placed my order & hoped for the best. Happy to say that it was ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!! So glad i gave Doc B's another chance & will definitely be ordering again.",
      "I have been a HUGE Doc B's fan since they opened. They were consistently impressive with their service AND their food. Unfortunately, the last time I visited was pretty disappointing. While the service remains impeccable, the sandwich that I have ordered many times before was TERRIBLE. \"Not Your Mom's Tuna Sandwich\" is my general go to but there have been times where the tuna has been a little too rare for my liking. This time, I made a point to tell the waiter that I wanted a bit more sear. Our appetizer, the \"Jumbo Lump Crab Stack\", was as good as usual but once my entree cam out, I realized that the tuna was even LESS cooked than usual. I mentioned this to the waiter & he apologetically carried it back to the kitchen. When he returned, the tuna had obviously bee thrown into a pan but as soon as I bit into it, I realized the temperature was the least of my problems... the cut of tuna itself was terrible! All ligaments & sinew. I wasn't able to bite through which immediately put me off to it. When the waiter again apologized & offered a new tuna sandwich, I refused. Luckily, my friend had ordered the special, a Tuna Burger that was OUTSTANDING! We split his dish & we ordered a Key Lime Pie to end the meal. To their credit, they did remove the tuna sandwich from our bill & while I will definitely return to the restaurant, not sure I'll ever order my once favourite sandwich again :c",
      "Doc B's NEVER disappoints! From the moment you walk in, the hostesses, waiters & waitresses are all so lovely & happy to see you! The service here is truly impeccable which is not something i'm accustomed to in casual dining establishments. The drinks are wonderful but for a work lunch, their Arnold Palmer hits the spot! For my meal, I had the Not Your Mom's Tuna Sandwich (seared ahi, avocado, crisp apple & wakame with ginger dressing) with a side of their Crispy Potatoes with jalapeño aioli. SO DELICIOUS! All the flavors go perfectly together. My friend had a meat sandwich :/ with the  Sweet Potato Fries with dijon honey. As always, I left super satisfied & in a great mood. SUCH a good spot!",
      "Made reservations for lunch yesterday and although the place was super packed, we were seated immediately. Everyone working there was incredibly friendly, helpful and seemed genuinely happy to be there from the hostesses, to the busboys to the waitresses. The menu is extensive with lots of creative & interesting dishes. Cocktail menu was great too! I had the CRAZY BEAUTIFUL (Straight Up: CH Vodka, elderflower, spiced pear) and my son had THE NATURAL (Tall On The Rocks: Bacardi Rum, strawberry, mint, lime). Both delicious & really well made! For my meal, I chose LEO'S LOBSTER ROLL (claw, knuckle, stone mustard slaw & roasted peanuts) and the SAUTÉED BROCCOLI(tahini & sesame) and my son had the PALM BEACH SKIRT STEAK with the broccoli as well. We both loved our food and the service throughout was really impeccable. All the servers were attentive to each table. If my water glass needed filing anyone walking by would refill, if I finished my meal, a waitress walking by would ask if I'd like my plate retired, if my drink was running low, another waitress would stop by & mention she'd put the order in for me & mention it to my waitress. The restaurant itself is expansive & very open & comfortable. All & all, a great addition to the Gables dining scene & I can't wait to work my way through the menu!",
      "I friggin love this place. Excellent quality. Tasty. Just love it. Never let's me down. And for whatever reason, there's never been a line the times that I've gone.",
      "Great place for drinks and appetizers, the meatball although it says it's spicy, it's more on the sweet side but still good. Nice after work crowd.",
      "Yum, Top 10 (possibly Top 5) fried chicken sandwiches. The breading is panko, so light and crispy while not talking over. The chicken remained juicy. I ordered the number 6 which I expected to have a kick and it was more subtle than anticipated. I do wish it had a little more heat, but it was delicious nonetheless and I paired it with the coleslaw which I was also a fan of.The sweet potato fries taste very natural. They're also huge! The candies bacon was a definite treat.",
      "Our waitress Jasmine was super attentive in a good way. She recommended the Wok bowl and I got it with spicy Thai sauce. The Brussels sprouts salad was delicious. The California salad was amazing too. Didn't think sweet potato chips and guacamole wouldn't work together but they did. We tried several different drinks among our group. The beetle juice doesn't taste like beets but is very refreshing and you feel like you've done something healthy.",
      "This is a must in Coral Gables. Been coming for a few years now and it never disappoints. They have a very welcoming host staff that will gladly walk you to your seat, which their living room seating is great and very comfortable. It welcomes friends and family to quality conversations and a good time. And I haven't even gotten to the menu! Our waiter was Patrick which was very patience and extremely helpful with explaining the menu at length and offering alternative options to fit what we were looking for. He was great! He deserves a promotion! He leads with service and compliments with hospitality. He made the experience worth it. One of my favorite dishes on the menu is the Knife & Fork Cobb salad. This is my go to every time. I could eat this everyday and not get bored. It's a delicious combination of flavors. The cornbread breadcrumbs are so good with the crumbled blue cheese and dates. I usually sub the breaded chicken for grilled chicken but that is just preference. We also got the Oreo ice cream for dessert. My gosh it was incredible! The hard shell chocolate made it even better if that was even possible All in all, Doc B's is a safe bet for good food and quality experience. A very bright spot on Miracle Mile"

      "Bolivar was fantastic! The music, the vibes, the staff and most importantly the food was fantastic. Our waiter Camilo was so nice and attentive, he made sure we felt comfortable and was very attentive. We ordered the pabellón, bandeja paisa and the link salteado. The food was phenomenal! Authentic Latin flavors, the chicharrón was nice and crispy but not overly cooked. The beans were delicious. Overall a great experience. We look forward to visiting Bolivar on the near future!",
      "Ambiance is charming. Service was decent. FYI:  Soda refills are NOT free! Total surprise as server didn't mention that. $4 a glass full of ice not worth it! Food was ok.",
      "$30-40 bottles of wine and excellent food. The Cartegena plate tasted juuuuust like the food I ate when I was there. Colombian coconut rice is legitimately thr GOAT and they make it riiiiight here. Like, I love me some rice and peas but thiiiiiissssss, this right here?!?!?! We came on a non-busy day so I will say not sure how the service would be if it were packed. I'll be back.",
      "Our first time in Miami and first dining out led us to Bolivar since we were near Ocean Drive and were craving local Latin cuisine. We ordered one of each of the steak platters. We thoroughly enjoyed our meals and the service was friendly and very fast. I would highly recommended this restaurant if you're in the area!",
      "Sanyi was really nice and helpful on the menu.  Food was great the Ceviche with the Garlic Shrimp is probably the best we have ever had!  The drinks were great too!  Highly recommend!  Really cool bar scene.",
      "The menu is diverse and represents so many different countries. The interior ambience is really  charming. We ordered beef empanadas (which were different than expected since fried) but very tasty. Ordered the beef soup which had amazing flavor but the cut of beef wasn't ideal. I wish it was the pulled beef in the other dishes. The second dish on the mains was a beef dish and it was outstanding. Martina delivered exceptional service.",
      "I would have rated this place 5 stars after the first time I came here in 2018, but after returning yesterday, 4 stars. The reason why, is the drinks. We ordered a pitcher of white sangria, which was too sweet and mainly juice. I watched the bartender make it, and our suspicions were right: they poured 4 shots of wine, and the rest was juice and something that looked like simple syrup. If I wanted just juice I would have ordered it. Otherwise, the food is as good as I remember it being when I first came here. The showstopper really is the croquetas de yuca -- the best yuca I've had! I love how you can build your own platter -- either 2 items or 6, which is perfect for sharing. The atmosphere is lively -- they played music and later on in the night, people were dancing. Definitely a fun spot right in South Beach!",
      "We were wandering around the neighborhood checking out buildings and such when we stumbled on Bolivar's sign out front that said 2-4-1 happy hour margaritas. We walked in and this place was quite a sight. There is so much to look at and take in. The building is beautiful decorated and has a bunch of seated going straight back to an elevated stage. We were greeted by a server/bartender and we mentioned the happy hour special.  She made us some delicious margaritas and then went over their food menu.  We weren't hungry but the menu looks incredible. Their Columbian Picada de Bolivar looks amazing.  You can pick from a long list of dishes and make you own platter of 6 items to share for $58.  I wish we were hungry so we could try items such as sautéed garlic shrimps, cassava fries croquettes, and Venezuelan cheese sticks. There is a total of 22 items to pick from to make your own platter.  Some day when we go back to Miami, we will stop in for this platter and try a bunch of dishes. The margs and the server are worth stopping in for a drink at least.",
      "Great place to eat! Must get the paella for sure! It's their signature dish and they aren't cheap with the seafood! Very fresh and it's the best dish on the menu!",
      "Best food and awesome customer service, Miguel was our server and he did a splendid job. Will be back soon!"

She gave us lots of recommendations and was fast and friendly.To start we did the octopus bao buns and they were amazing. For dinner we had the Wagyu burger and seareal griller (grilled seafood).

I think some of the menu items are overpriced and that you're paying for the vibe, but a lot of the little touches were cool (like how your bill is tucked in a copy of Robinson Crusoe). I do think the decor is a little too eclectic, and is trying to be too many things. I can only vouch for the brunch vibe, because I came for brunch when it was much quieter and had a family friendly atmosphere. Customer service was excellent and the staff was so very helpful.",

Our servers, Maria and Alvaro were SPECTACULAR in explaining everything and talking with us. We had the Lobster Ceviche and Seareal Griller - both were AMAZING. I'm still thinking about the lobster ceviche. As for drinks, we had the pistachio margarita and the watermelon mojito. Very yummy. Dessert was made by Lilo and we had the Bread Pudding.

      "For my first review of 2023 I must pen my thoughts about my most favorite dining experience of 2022 (and quite possibly ever), which was at L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon.Wow. To say this was magnificent is an understatement. The service, the wine, and of course the food were all incredible. It almost felt like a performance involving everyone on staff from the somm, to the server and the chefs. There is a reason this spot has 2 Michelin Stars, and based on our experience it was so well deserved. When you dine here, you can choose from the seasonal menu (ours was winter) which is a 3 course tasting with dessert, the 10 course tasting menu, or a la carte. We opted for the 3 course tasting menu. One thing to note, reservations after 9 pm cannot accommodate the 10 course menu, so if you're looking to indulge in that experience make an earlier reservation. We opted to each order something different from the three course menu so we could try 6 dishes together versus 3. I loved everything, but the stand outs to me were below:+Tuna crudo starter: this had brown butter, mustard seeds, some apple and was served with a bit of tuna tartare on the side. Absolutely divine.+Scallop: the most perfectly seared scallop with a sauce that you needed to soak up with every last piece of bread.+Lamb Saddle: while the lamb was cooked to perfection, it was the restaurant favorite side that had me in heaven - the potatoes. The simple potato, prepared so perfectly that I could have easily made a home in the kitchen at that station to eat them forever.We also enjoyed the Hamachi, the sweetbreads and the short rib with foie. Those were divine as well, but the above three were my favorites!Everything comes with delectable sauces, which makes the bread basked of house made petite baguette and croissant extra delightful.Our server, Alexis was so sweet and knowledgeable. Her and her team did an amazing job executing this super special meal. They even sent us a complimentary roasted artichoke, because I think they could tell how enamored we were by this whole experience. We also ended the night with two cocktails that I loved, one was the Rouge et Noir, and the other an espresso martini but with reposado tequila. If you're wondering if this is worth the splurge, wonder no more. The 3 courses plus dessert leave you feeling more than satisfied. Similar to the way that music is the expression of a musicians creativity, so too is food. The expression of the creativity and skill of a chef. And this experience was quite the epic symphony.",
      "The decor is beautiful.  The service is very friendly.  The food is pretty good.  Some of the food is amazing and some of the food is not great.  Would this be a 2 star in NY?  No chance.  The pacing of the meal is very fast for a tasting menu.  The wine list is a 3 to 4 times mark up yet your halfway through the meal before the wine opens.  The place has a Miami fast paced night life vibe but it kind of feels like they are rushing to turn the table.The open kitchen is a great show to watch.  I wouldn't say don't go but I also wouldn't say go.  I would definitely not go a second time.",
      "We were looking for somewhere special to celebrate our ten year wedding anniversary and L'Atelier ended up being the perfect choice. We above all wanted to go somewhere where the food wasn't only great, but was an experience as well. Our server Nadia was knowledgeable and personable and we ended up going with the Evolution Tasting Menu. The sommelier was also extremely helpful with helping us select our wine. Every course was amazing, even the sweetbreads which I don't normally eat. They also added a nice personal touch by giving us a handwritten note and an additional dessert for it being our anniversary. Will definitely be checking out Jardinier next.",
      "Highly recommended by friends I was finally able to make reservations. I expected a lot for a two Michelin star restaurant and they did not disappoint. Service was impeccable. Food was delicious. There are 2 tasting menus and an a la carte option. The restaurant recommends between 3-5 dishes per person. I had three and with dessert I was very satisfied. Highly recommend the following:LA LANGOUSTINELE PIGEONLE FILET MIGNONLE CRUDO DE KAMPACHIOur table of 4 ordered the 4 desserts from the menu and LE DÉLICE EXOTIQUE was by far my favorite.",
      "This is as good as it gets as far as a culinary experience. I totally understand why it is called the workshop. From the second that you are seated you know that you are in for a special experience. I have been to my fair share of open style kitchens from Leo in Bogota, Colombia to Stubborn Seed in MIami beach you know that when a restaurant has an open kitchen you expect to see artist at work. This was no different. You feel the energy of everyone. They are welcoming and happy that you are there. We were seated at the bar right away which was perfect because I was lucky enough to be sat right in the middle. I loved being able to enjoy the whole experience watching the artist at work. We decided to do the Evolution tasting menu. For me that was the best choice because I was able to try all of the chefs specialties and I know what I want to go back and have next time. Every single dish was gorgeous visually and it tasted incredible. The meal started with the Foie gras, I loved how it mixed with the foam on top. The second course was the Lobster with caviar. This was one of my favorite dishes all the flavors tied together perfectly. The tuna was to die for. I love a good tuna but the game changer was the warm butter with the Dijon mustard on top. Then we had a tomato salad. It was good but what came next was one of my favorite dishes of my life. It was a scallop. It came in a glass globe once they took off the top the aroma was incredible. Every single bite was absolutely amazing. Then came the black cod and the filet mignon. I loved the filet mignon because it came two ways as well I loved the potato. Finally came the dessert our waiter Manny was kind enough to bring us out an extra dessert because we were celebrating a special occasion. Everything in this place is absolutely amazing it is a must visit if you are in Miami or you want to splurge on a nice dinner.",
      "Overall underwhelming experience!  The decor of the restaurant and the food are on two opposite spectrums.  The restaurant has a sexy, hip look you would associate with an Asian restaurant so the vibe and the food are completely misaligned.  Low energy restaurant with flute music in the background - despite being seated at the counter there wasn't much of an atmosphere.The service was extremely disappointing - we were celebrating a birthday which was noted in the reservation and the staff kept saying anniversary.  It took 20min to get a drink - we ordered two dirty martinis which were horrible (warm and straight vodka).  Needless to say we returned them the 2nd round that came out were watered down and again not dirty.  I ended up returning mine and moving on to something else.  Sitting at the counter was weird the staff seemed unorganized - we initially wanted to go with the wine paired 4 course meal when we were told they don't want to keep the master sommelier on the clock for much longer.  Nobody really took the time to explain the concept and it took quite some time until we finally ordered. The amuse-bouche was disappointing and we didn't taste the foie gras.  Our fav were filet mignon, lobster, sweetbread and the desserts.  The food overall was great, however with the lack of service and other tidbits I noted above it honestly was not a memorable experience.  Being that this is a 2 star restaurant we expected more.",
      "Went to this place a cpl months ago. Sat at the bar. Service was awesome and the  food speaks for itself.",
      "Listen. L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon is so deserving of it's two Michelin stars! After coming home from our honeymoon, we decided to extend our celebration with a reservation here last Friday night. Our reservation was ready and we were invited to head directly upstairs or to grab a drink downstairs (at Le Jardinier). Once upstairs we were greeted, seated, and waited upon promptly. We had seats at the bar - and it was so fun to spend the evening watching the action in the kitchen; but, they do have tables that are separate from that area. The waitress explained the three different menu options: a la carte, the seasonal tasting menu, or the evolution tasting menu. We opted for the evolution tasting menu - which they told us was the best sampling of \"all chef has to offer.\"pour commencer - foie gras royale, parmesan foam, essence of Maury Vieilles Vigness // Honestly, probably the best foie gras I've ever had (which I realize is a wildly bougie statement). le caviar et le homard - caviar and maine lobster, crustacean jelly, celeriac cream // I think this was my least favorite course - I loved all the elements individually, but not as a bite. le thon - tuna sashimi in a warm vinaigrette of brown butter, mustard, and exotic lime // I never would have thought to add brown butter to tuna, but omg. It was delicious, I wanted to lick the plate.la salade de tomates - warm heirloom tomato salad and jelly, fresh goat cheese, tarragon-lemongrass vinaigrette // Who knew tomato jelly was so yum? I really enjoyed this light and refreshing dish. les saint jacques - scallop served in cilantro broth, coconut emulsion and calamari // This was my husband's favorite dish and was just so well balanced - the salt of the calamari and the natural sweetness of the scallop.le bar - poached black bass, delicate marine mousse, mussel and vanilla broth, stuffed zucchini flower // The fish was like butter - it just melted in your mouth. le filet mignon - with green asparagus, wild ramps and marcona almonds // The potatoes that they were served with was the biggest miss for me (they were a bit gluey, but delicious), but the filet was cooked to perfection and so delicious. la foret noire - black forest chocolate cremeux, cherries and kirsch chantilly // My husband's favorite dessert - but such a cute presentation! la fraise - diced strawberries, strawberry light emulsion and corossol sherbet // My favorite dessert - it was a light and refreshing way to end a meal. lime buns // Served at the conclusion of the meal, these were light, refreshing, and so delicious. And because that wasn't enough, we added the evening's special:  spaghetti with parmesan and truffles from Australia. So decadent and so worth it. Overall, service was fantastic. Every dish was explained, they brought us a third, special dessert for our honeymoon celebration, and the somm was helpful in selecting a bottle of wine. If you have the opportunity (and, honestly, the coin) definitely head to L'Atelier for your next celebration!",
      "Worst French experience ever. I'm not a cordon bleu chef but you simply can't deep fry sweetbread then put sweet n sour sauce on top of itPaid $1,500+ for 4 person and left hungry afterwards - dishes are either too salty, too sour, or too sweet.",
      "I have been to L'Atelier, in Miami, Paris & St Barths and I can honestly say that there is a consistency to their excellence! I typically rely on the seasonal offerings, or chef recommendations, as the menu items can be quite complex. The restaurant is very busy, so make sure you book as far out as possible! Pricy, but worth it!!"

I did walk outside though and I could see this place being a cute date spot.The hummus was really good esp. with the thinly sliced warm naan bread it is served alongside. I ordered the cauliflower which was really good. For my entree, I ordered the lamp chops which did take some time to come out, but it was definitely worth the wait! Some of the best lamb I've had; I would definitely come here again just for the lamb.",
      "My Lebanese family visited yesterday.Owners were welcoming and accommodating to specific dishes of my family- they withstood our critic nature phenomenally.Excellent hummus, babaghanoush, grape leaves and kibbeh nayeh!Lebanese wine was excellent and reasonably priced.Definitely a place to go return for seconds.",
      "Such an amazing place to grab dinner!! We sat on the patio and the environment was wonderful! We also had a great waitress that did a wonderful job juggling some very busy and large tables. Definitely would return! tabbulé (5/5) - soooooo delicious. It was a light dish that combined amazingly with the hummus with meat.hummus with meat (5/5) - also fantastic. One of the best hummus' I've ever had. It paired really well with the tabbulékafta (3/5) - I didn't enjoy this dish but I am not a ground beef person. My partner ordered this and generally likes ground beef, but compared to everything else it didn't stand out. branzino filet (5/5) - FANTASTIC. Perfectly cooked and extremely fresher. Very happy that I ordered this!!",
      "Hummus, hookahs, house music? You feel like you've just transported to a cool Beirut spot for a wildly delicious meal. We loved the baba ghanoush, shrimp kebab was so fresh! Sangria was poppin! Next time we're in wynwood we are excited to try more of the menu.Lots of street parking close by, use the parking apps.",
      "Honestly I think i found the best Arab food in Miami. Just wow. Prices are amazing , service and ambience is great and the food is just beyond of this world. I have tried many places around Miami. Some of them are ok, some are very very good but honestly this one is just so flavorful and authentic. We ordered the hummus and the labne which is the yoghurt cream and both were simple but so rich in flavor. Then we got a tabule salad with kibbe nayeh and fried kibbe. Finally we got the steak in cream peppercorn sauce and the branzio fillet. I wanted the lamb chops but they were out of them which made me think of how good they probably are. Please do yourself a favor and come here!!!",
      "This place is sooo good ! Great customer service , great food . Delicious drinks , finallyPlaying some Arabic music , delicious hookah the cheapest in Miami I think $25. Lol.Decor is so cute and ambiance is ideal! We lovedThis place .We will def be back.",

      "As food prices go up, I find myself constantly having to remind myself that this is why menu prices are high. While I wouldn't pay $20 for knafeh, there are some items on this menu that are absolutely worth it. Their kibbeh nayye was fresh and delicious, their hummus tasted as it should (tahini) and they offered a Lebanese beer option. The ambiance is trendy with a Middle Eastern flair. Outside seating is offered and the setting can be great for groups or romantic dates. They also offer plenty of Lebanese main dishes and wines. While I wasn't ready to try either last night, I will definitely be back for more.Service wasn't exceptional but there wasn't anything worth complaining about. Hence, my 5 star review. I probably expected a more inviting attitude but again, they were fine. I believe they offer hookahs, from what I saw outside. Definitely a vibe.",
      "Excellent vibe and location. The parking was easily available, and The place starts filling up sometime in the early evening.We had a wonderful experience for an evening dinner. We started off with appetizers namely the hummus with beef and other small apps/dishes. After this, we ordered a mixed grill which included some shrimp and were floored by how delightful everything tasted. It would certainly come back not just for the ambient atmosphere and service, but the excellent food options as well.",
      "A friend of mine heard about Magdoos and wanted to try the \"Haitian Lebanese\" restaurant. Spoiler alert this is 99% Lebanese, the 1% Haitian was the fact that they sold Prestige beer. Dassit!When we arrived we were pleasantly surprised by how cute the patio is, it was clearly very thought out and intentionally decorated. Looking at the menu we were skeptical if we were going to stay, we were hoping for fusion and nothing was, in addition, nothing was really grabbing our attention. The staff was great at breaking down the menu and overall were very kind. Kebbe: We ordered the fish and meat kebbe to start it off and we were really happy with them so we decided to stay. The kebbe was flavorful and not greasy. Meat hummus: Smething I've never had in the past but was good, not the best but very satisfying. Don't know if I would order it againBaba ganoush: flavorful but I've def had much better, and because I've had much better ones I wasn't impressed. My friend whose never had it before enjoyed it. The pita was very good. Lamb chops: was missing major seasoning, it was very ok. Branzino: very dry and flavorless, the one dish I definitely would not recommend. Steak: the steak was cooked perfectly and the sauce was really good, we got mixed grilled vegetables on the side and wish there was a better variety."

      "Beware! First We were told if we did not show for our reservation we would be charged $35 per person. This seems quite outrageous for a party of 6. Secondly we had already spent over $100 at the bar waiting for a table when one of the door men informed us there was a dress code. No shorts for men and myman was wearing shorts. Prior to arriving I had searched Swans website and also did a google search to see if there was a dress code. I didn't find anything. I didn't see anything posted at the entrance about a dress code and the hostess who let us in to go to the bar didn't say anything about a dress code. The manager came and spoke with us and said that my boyfriend was dressed nice so he could stay even though he wasn't supposed to able to in shorts. But this whole incident was extremely unpleasant and could have been avoided if Swan  would post in writing somewhere the dress code. We would have happily abided by the dress code. However my boyfriend was made to feel discriminated against after he noticed other men were wearing shorts. Did they get spoken to by the staff and management regarding the dress code or was my boyfriend singled out. By the way my boyfriend is black. Thirdly the house drinks were excellent but we asked to have the bartender make us Hemingway daiquiris. Any decent bartender should know how to make a basic daiquiri. A Hemingway just adds grapefruit juice. It took a very long time to get the daiquiris and they were not Hemingways. For some reason they were pineapple. So I'm assuming the bar tenders only know how to make the house cocktails well. And we saw that they had grapefruit juice behind the bar. That's why we ordered that drink. Maybe they ran out but if so they should have let us know. Those were the three main issues we had with Swan. The food was great! House cocktails were great! Atmosphere is fun, loud, and crowded. The outdoor seating was a total vibe! Service was adequate. I personally won't go back after the way my boyfriend was treated. Especially after our whole party spent around a grand in there.",
      "Went there for a quick diner during weekday, the atmosphere was nice and they were playing good music in the background(mostly house and hiphop) We made a reservation and arrived incredibly late but we got seated without waiting anyway.Pretty good food, great oysters and drinks. Caviar was fine as well",
      "The swan delivers right away on ambiance. See and be seen! We came here expecting beautiful interior design, beautiful people, and lots of great service. This is pretty much what we received! Cocktails were good and offered a creative taste for all preferences. I especially love a good spritz, so the Get Spritzy was a good first choice for me. The stone crab and artichokes stand out for apps. We can't really get stone crab where we are from, so we were pumped to have the option. The dip for the fried artichokes made the dish. We also had the bursts which somehow had amazing tomatoes in season and ready to go. For mains we had the chicken and rigatoni. Our order either got lost in the rush or was placed late, so we actually received it quite late and after the party next to us (who arrived and ordered after us) received the same dish. The chicken was great. The mushroom and gravy were homey and rich. The rigatoni was tasty but the sauce was a bit overwhelming. Pasta cooked perfectly. The staff took care of us and we truly enjoyed our meal.",
      "I'm happy to see that Swan now offer unlimited select drinks for brunch.I went for my birthday brunch a couples months ago . The food was delicious and the ambiance was beautiful. It's located in a secluded corner in the Miami arts district. The service could've been a little better- my waiter was not approachable. Expect to spend a few bucks here as the average price of one drink is almost $20.",
      "Atmosphere and bartenders were nice. Food is very good. I give three stars because the host made us wait 30 minutes to sit outside because of \"reservations\" when the place was empty. When we were sat, our service was subpar. Everyone just standing around goofing off.",
      "Very fun and gorgeous restaurant!  The drinks are delicious and their caesar salad is to die for. The food and brunch is also really good.",
      "Finally made it... and miami spice was the perfect time to check out what swan had to offer.. overall we loved the experience! What we ordered on the menu was: the tarte frambee , the snapper ceviche, the branzino, the roasted chicken, the 2 dessert options (hot fudge profiterole & the mango pavlova)... We both loved the 1st 2 courses.. everything was amazing and the server /staff were great. The dessert I wasn't as much a fan of.  Wasn't bad but compared to everything else it was just ok.Overall great meal and great experience.",
      "We came to Swan for the Miami Spice Brunch... side note we love Miami Spice! The menu options were great, we tried the chicken chop salad, the guava cheese French toast, margarita pizza, crispy artichoke, the fish ceviche and the steak and eggs. The food was good, it was nothing to write home about, but good. The guava and cheese French toast was the only favorite at the table it was so sweet and tasty.",
      "Came for my bday celebration. We had brunch off the Miami spice menu. If you make reservations, make sure you're whole party is there, because they will not sit you unless the whole party is present. Pros: location, vibe, unlimited Rosè for 32.00, service, ambiance Cons: food was alright. Not great , not bad. I expected much better. We sat inside because well it's Miami and this heat. We were so loud and no one said anything. They had great music playing. Overall, I would go back for the ambiance and fun but definitely not for the food. If you are going for a great food, don't do it. If you are coming to have some drinks with your friends and have a nice vibe, then this is the place.",
      "Meh. Came for Miami spice brunch with a friend and was very unimpressed (I actually was looking forward to the regular brunch menu being available, since the Miami spice one was very underwhelming ...but unfortunately it was not.) We started with microscopic burrata with tons of bread (my friends bread was burnt) and then for my main I opted for the omelet that was extremely salty. My friend got the French toast (she enjoyed). We waited for dessert for about 40 minutes (not exaggerating) and it was okay. Only good thing was the drinks were really good, not watered down and good quality (pricy but whatever) and our server was really nice and personable."

      "My first time being in the new John Martins and I must say it is a major change from the old one! Completely renovated (including the bathrooms) with an updated menu. I came for lunch with my fiancé and had the Guinness burger. The burger itself was massive and alone will fill you up! The fries are more like steak fries than thin fries but they were perfectly quicker. I also got the tank IPA draft which was great as well. The beers are a little bit more pricey but still very good. We also tried an expresso martini which was made perfectly. The service team was very nice and friendly. However, they do need to improve on speed of service since most of the people coming during the week for lunch are on their break and don't have more than an hour to eat.  It over all service was very goodI asked about them opening outdoor seating and according to the bartenders they are in the works to make that happen and pending city approvalOverall, I will come back to John Martins and think it is a very nice upscale Irish pub in coral gables",
      "I've been meaning to try the newly renovated John Martins. After being closed at right after covid I didn't think they were going to reopen. We came in after work and the only items available was the late night menu. The updated restaurant definitely has a great ambience. The table side was closed but they had a couple of high tops and the bar open. The decor is really great and it was cold inside which is a nice plus also. We are not big beer drinkers so we ordered some margaritas instead. We ordered a watermelon and passion fruit. Margarita which honestly just tasted like juice and didn't seem to have any alcohol in it at all. This is the reason for my four-star review instead of giving them a five star review. I know they are a pub, so I'm sure their beers are great , but if you offer cocktails, I expect them to be good as well. The glasses were a little small and stuffed with ICE. I Just felt like the margaritas needed more alcohol and they would have been good.Onto the food we order the pork belly bites, the Irish nachos, and the pub fry trio. All of the food was really great. The whiskey sauce and the truffle sauce were my favorites for the french fries. They were crispy and tasted great. The pork belly was soft and tender . And we ended up adding brisket on the nachos which was also good.All in all the food what is the big surprise here and if they fix the alcoholic drinks, I feel like this would be a home run. I'm hoping somebody will see this review and make the necessary adjustments because I would definitely like to be back to have a good strong drink that would hopefully change my mind.",
      "Great place! Love the renovations! Bartenders and barbacks are amazing, especially Ian and Leo.  Guinness fresh and creamy and delicious.  The only thing is change the music rotation. Miami music is the same thing every day: feels like Groundhog Day. So much music in the world: give us more Irish music or at least mix it in the music. This is the only Irish place on Miracle Mile: let's feel like we're not in another Miami venue. Love this place overall. Great to see it back. We almost cried when it was taken away because of COVID. We're regular customers. Glad to be here.",
      "I'm so glad they're back. I went for lunch and had a wonderful experience.The staff: Everyone from the hostess to the waiter were so polite, attentive and professional. When my mom needed to go the restroom, the hostess didn't just tell her where it was, she walked her over there. The food: the fish & chips were delicious. The fish is cod. It's crispy and delicious on its own, but I had to dip it in the tartar sauce which was great. The waiter told me to try a little of the smashed peas in the tartar sauce and it was good like that too. The fries look chunky so I thought they were going to be soggy but no! They were perfectly crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside. I wish I would've had room for dessert.I had an Irish coffee and although it wasn't served in the traditional way, it was delicious. I thought it was going to be overly sweet because of the green whipped cream decoration but it was perfect. Don't judge a book by its cover.Everything was clean and looked new. The bathroom was perfectly clean too. I look forward to going back.",
      "THE PLACE: Located in Coral Gables, parking is plentiful though can be tricky. John Martins is stunning (I wish my house looked like this). The outside is representative of the food/culture embraced in the restaurant  and the inside is modern, cozy and impeccable. THE FOOD: My fiance had Fish & Chips 5/5 and he was over the moon with the dish! I had to try it and the fish was sooo fresh and the batter was delicious a d not greasy at all. Flavors and textures were perfect. I had the the Guinness Burger 4/5 and it was tasty but lacked sauce or something that would give it \"p-zaz\". I asked my waiters for a sauce that would help and he reccomended the Irish BBQ sauce. I hate bbq sauce but this was delicious! So different and gave the burger what it needed. However, the truffle fries that came with the burger were the best fries ive had! Crispy crunch thin outside and soft delectable inside. THE SERVICE: Our waiter PABLO was phenomenal! He is actually one of the best waiters I've encountered in SFL. He was so attentive, fast, kind, professional. He kept coming back to refill my water, so I asked him to please leave the jar - He wasn't able to leave the jar, but he did something just as great, he brought me extra water, so I can have here at my disposal. The host & manager were very attentive as well.",
      "Experience was Top notch. From The moment we walked in, we felt welcomed! John Martin was a restaurant on the mile that opened in 1989. They closed down a couple of years and just reopened. The location has been renovated and it looks absolutely beautiful. It is modern, inviting, spacious, comfortable equipped with a wall-to-wall bar. We were so happy to see it reopened. It is trendy and welcoming. We were greeted by our hostess, \"sweet Z\" from Ethiopia. When we came in, we were not sure if we were going to eat at John Martin's so we asked them to let us see their menus and they were super cool with that. Then when we decided to stay, we were not sure if we wanted to sit at one of the high top tables or regular ones. She noticed our hesitation  and offered one of the tables reserved for eight people. We thought that was so generous and kind. When we sat at this huge booth we  offered to share it with others since it was so spacious, and she responded with \"absolutely not; we want you to be happy and comfortable\" and that is how we felt at this new John Martin's. The manager and assistant manager also came by personally to greet us and tell us a littleabout the old and current ownership. We love going to places where people really bring us in and make immediate connections with us. It makes a huge difference and tends to want to make us come back. Not only is the customer service exceptional here, but the food is absolutely delicious. We started the meal with spicy meatball appetizers which were piping hot, comprised of grits with cheddar cheese. It was the most delectable treat with a nice refreshing cocktail. My husband ordered a pub sandwich and I ordered the impossible burger, the vegetarian burger with  honey, glazed carrots. The cocktails were excellent and the wine list was very good. The ambiance was cool and casual with a combination of: young and older couples, sports fans watching football at the bar, and families enjoying fries and hamburgers. We are looking forward to trying out everything on that menu. (See attached)What made this place epic was the service. Our server Jose wanted to make sure that we were well taken care of. And they were constantly checking in. We have now decided to make this one of our regular weekend stops . They play live music on Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays. Looking forward to coming back. These are some of the pictures of the meals that we had- definitely recommend John Martins on Miracle Mile.",
      "John Martin's underwent a complete makeover and looks so great inside! I'm happy to have it back. I dined on Wednesday night and they were slammed, as almost every table was taken.  Sadly, it was SO loud that you couldn't have a conversation with the person sitting next to you without yelling. I ordered the Miracle Mile Margarita and it was sad. They had run out of Tajin but, that probably wouldn't have helped it much anyway. It tasted like a tart artificial margarita mix and you could also tell that it wasn't shaken at all. The chicken wings were also a miss. We opted for the Irish BBQ sauce and it was tangy but, not in a good way and just felt really heavy. The John Martin's burger was great! Highly recommend it. The fries were also great.I regret not ordering the Fish & Chips because they looked great. I'll be back to try them soon.",
      "It's BACK!! Every time I walked by this location over the past 3 years, I pointed it out to my partner and lamented how sad it was to see it shut down. But I also shared hopes someone would come in and save this place... And Breakwater Hospitality did just that! The place has a beautiful and fresh new look that has tons of detail yet feels simple. Inviting, yet warm. I really liked the extensive whiskey list (although they're still working on stocking their inventory) and the fact they have Lucky Hour from 4-7 and then again late night. I did not order food this first visit but everything going past me looked and smelled delectable - like the fish & chips and bangers & mash. I'm looking forward to coming back again and again just like I used to back in the day.",
      "Welcome back John martins! We've missed you! JMs come back with a face lift and a good revamp. I wish I had taken a pic of the wings they had but wow! I am a chicken wing girlie and these were juicy and flavorful paired with a wildly tasty sauce! I wish I had taken a picture!",
      "Great spot to watch sports or hangout with friends! It's been revitalized and it's been so nice to see everyone come back to this spot. The food is amazing and the drinks are splendid. They have the loaded nachos that are probably my favorite ones I've ever had."

      "A \"must\" in Miami! I recently went back here once they got their Michelin star, and my experience definitely confirmed that they are very deserving of that recognition. We started off with the baked oysters which were absolutely mouth watering. I had the venison and it was delicious. The sommelier picked out an amazing wine selection for everyone. My favorite part, hands down, was the flan. I could come back here every night just for the flan.",
      "I always joke about automatically awarding a restaurant 5 stars if they offer a purse hook, so of course, when the purse hook was offered, internally, I was clapping. Jokes aside, these are all the reasons why Ariete is not just a 5-star, but also Michelin starred:*Beautifully crafted cocktails*The attention to detail - including the aromatherapy hot/wet towels between first and second course, and the pre and post dinner treats from the chef*Friendly and attentive staff who take the time to welcome and accommodate you. Started with drinks at the bar and now your table is ready? No problem. Make your way to your table and your drinks will soon make their way to you.  *The flavor, originality and presentation of the foodHere's what I can vouch for: wood grilled oysters with choice of selecting between bone marrow butter or sea urchin butter (if ordering a dozen, you can do 6 of each), short rib, venison, cigar box for dessert (this was an experience!). All items paired with a Bordeaux blend. Pre-dinner drinks included an espresso martini and Florida Orange Punch. Reservations recommended. Enjoy!",
      "Ariete was our first, but hopefully, not the last Michelin-starred restaurant outside of Chicago, and they lived up to the hype! Let me start by complimenting the outstanding service the whole staff provided, though, a special shout-out to Yvonne who set the tone for the whole night. Professional, yet, laid-back, she struck a great balance and made us feel comfortable, but with the care and attention of a fine dining restaurant; some of the best service we have ever experienced. The food reached these heights as well, with the Langoustine dish being one of our early favorites, only to be later topped by the Rohan Duck. Both were fantastic dishes in presentation, thought, and flavor. The Cigar dessert was everything you could want in a dessert and more. The other dishes were good, but not as outstanding as the ones I mentioned, with the Squab being the least favorite dish we ate.A special note on the non-alcoholic pairings: try one. They are refreshing, unique, and most importantly, do not make you miss alcohol. Check this place out if you're in Miami!",
      "We made a reservation for a party of 6 to celebrate our wedding day. They were accommodating and allowed us to pick between indoor and outdoor dining. The menu selection is a great combination of Latin flavors and traditional American cuisine, and the presentation of each dish definitely lives up to the Michelin star designation. We ordered the duck for two, and they came by the table to prepare it with a duck press. It was definitely a fun bit of theatre. The sleeper hits were the yuca (which was prepared in a totally different way from the yuca I've eaten in the past) and the cigar dessert (which was served in a cigar box that we were dying to take home!). The drinks were also delicious and went well with the meal. Overall it was an extremely memorable meal for the most special of wedding nights!",
      "Outstanding ! Well deserved Michelin rating.  The food was outstanding and very tasteful.  The oysters were excellent!!!! I must say the drinks were outstanding also.  Our waitress was phenomenal, she gave excellent recommendations and knew the menu well. All her recommendations were on point. Dessert, must try Cigar!",
      "Hi Alexander! Thank you for your sincere comments. We really appreciate you taking the time to write this. It really makes our day to hear that our guests enjoyed themselves. We are very happy to hear that both the food and service were on point. We do hope to see you soon!",
      "Ariete located in coconut grove, a very cozy ambiance. It's no surprise they received a Michelin star.The wait staff was very friendly and attentive the entire night. The sommelier was extremely helpful in selecting the perfect pairing for dinner. We started with the oysters, we did half bone marrow and half sea urchin. Both were AMAZING! We also had the langoustine and the Florida orange. The langoustine was tasty and refreshing and the Florida orange was very photogenic and tasty with the bead. For our mains we had the Wagyu, the snapper, and the venison. All three were tasty but the Wagyu was the best. After the mains we ordered another round of oysters, yes they are that delicious. We finished the meal with the flan for desert. Best flan I've had in a very long time. Will definitely be going back for more.",

      "First, I love when there's valet parking right in front of the restaurant. Makes things a lot more convenient, especially if running late lol. We came here for date night and loved the atmosphere. Very calm and great music was playing in the background. We were attended right away and our waiter gave us great drink recommendations. Both the Negroni and jungle book were delicious and refreshing. We decided to do the \"versos clásicos\" tasting menu and I was so glad we did. Everything in this tasting menu was amazing and was way above our expectations. I savored every bite! The reason why I didn't give 5 stars was because of the duck. The waiter sold this addition to the tasting menu as a once in a lifetime experience and the best duck that could be found in Miami. Unfortunately, this was not true for me. The duck itself was very chewy and did not taste good without being drenched in the sauce. The tamal that came with it did taste good but was very dry. It fell short in my opinion and I was not able to finish this dish. Overall, I loved it (except the duck)! I would go back and have the tasting menu again!",
      "Ariete blew my expectations out of the water and was one of the best meals I've had since moving to Miami one year ago. To start, I asked for a custom cocktail, which they made with their own unique twist, and it was fantastic. I ordered the farmers pan a cotta appetizer, and my husband the wahoo. Both were good, but in retrospect we didn't need to order them because little did we know that the duck for two that we ordered would be a LOT of food and come with salad, a duck tamale, and two duck pastelitos. The sauce for the duck was made tableside, which was fun to watch, and the portion of duck breast was twice as much as we anticipated. The salad was so fresh and delightfully balanced the slightly sweet richness of the duck sauce. My husband loved the tamale. Service was exceptional, and ambiance was perfect for a date. Would love to go back and try their other dishes and brunch!",
      "Drinks only review: I have been here a few times for drinks. They are prepared quickly and are quite strong. The drink menu is creative and the bartenders are very approachable. It gets quite loud in there as the dining area is next to the bar, even without ambient music. I would come back, earlier next time,  when there are less people, to have a nice drink and conversation.",
      "We came here for their Sunday Brunch. Giving that they have a Michelin star I was beyond excited. But to be honest the food felt short. While I could tell that everything was cooked to perfection, some flavor was lacking. I think I either needed more substance or more flavor altogether. Plus at $75/pp for three tasting-menu sized plates I thought it wasn't worth the money. Keep in mind everything from the duck, the fish, and the meat was cooked to perfection. Sublime! And the service was beyond expectations. But I wouldn't go back.",

      "Dōma was truly a fantastic experience. I went for an anniversary dinner, and upon being seated, the server told us \"happy anniversary\" which showed they took the extra time to look at the details of the reservation. The staff in general were also very attentive throughout the entire night.They start with a bread basket which contained breadsticks, slices of bread, and cubes of a cheese bread which was served with a whipped ricotta, and this was DELICIOUS. I could've easily had another serving of the whipped ricotta, and the bread was all delicious. We finished the entire basket!I had the Candele allá genovese dish, which is pasta served with a slow cooked beef ragú and topped with a Parmesan espuma. The meat sauce was incredibly rich, pasta beautifully Al dente, and the cheese espuma added nice flavor and umami without the heaviness that a layer of melted cheese would add. Very delicious and surprisingly fillingFor dessert, we ordered the pistachio gelato, which they only make a small portion of every night so I recommend an earlier dinner to increase your chances of getting one (our reservation was at 7). It was amazing, and my wife's favorite part of the meal. It was a tall serving of rich and creamy pistachio gelato, sprinkled with pistachio dust. A great way to finish the dinner.Overall I really recommend the establishment if you're looking for a higher end Italian fine dining experience",
      "Food: We got the truffle pasta, cacio e pepe, and the branzino. The branzino was the biggest stand out (and the restaurants specialty), tender, fresh, and full of flavour. The pastas were both good, but thats it. They were not $39 good... the truffle pasta is basically the spaghetti with butter and parmesan that you would get as an 8 year old kid out to dinner with your parents, but tastefully displayed, drenched in truffle oil, and topped with a couple slices of black truffle. Tastes good, especially if you're craving that truffle taste, but it just costs a lot for what you get honestly. I'm a terrible cook but I could replicate this at home, I swear. Service: it was okay, the hostess was a little rude, our server was more kind. Overall... meh... nothing worth mentioning that made our experience more enjoyable. Ambiance: Great looking spot with lots of tables and a nice patio. Seems like it turns into more of a bar past 9pm which is interesting and could be fun!Edit: we both had food poisoning after this night. It is entirely possible that it wasn't from doma, but this was the last meal we ate.",
      "Lovely little modern Italian restaurant tucked away in busy Wynwood. Nice lush outdoor back patio. It's a nice change of pace from where I usually frequent in this neighborhood. First - not many places offer fried zucchini flowers so I always jump at the chance to have them. Stuffed with lots of ricotta.My husband's octopus was good, my scallop risotto was just okay but I probably would have eaten all of my husband's candele with beef ragú. Delicious! Service was perfect - over the top attentive and funny tbh. He suggested gelato for dessert which we had. I thought the pistachio was delicious. Would like to come back and try more items!",
      "There really is no place like DOMA. This modern italian restaurant is so unique and really feel like there isn't anything like it in Miami. To start, this spot is located right at the outskirts of Wynwood. A beautiful striped building that has an indoor dining area as well as a beautiful terrace. Their bar is perfect to grab a drink before getting seated and their wine cellar is beautifully created for you to see all 800 wines they have in their space (yes, over 800 wines!).Everything I've tried here is just...chefs kiss. Here are some of my favorites:- Beef tartare: simply a must. - Candele alla genovese: made to perfection + may I add that they add a parmesan cheese foam to top it off!I could confidently recommend the entire menu because everything is so well made and lovely.",
      "EXQUISITO!!What a wonderful restaurant.The quality of food and service is high.For dinner we ordered:Pasta tartufo... OMG! Delicious! This is a heavy meal, but is feels light at the end.Tuna with rice... Smooth flavor without being fishy.Pistachio ice cream. A big portion, creamy and good.The red wine DONNA CHIARA to me is delicious, but this will depends for each type of palate. If you like strong and slightly dry, this is it!Manhattan whiskey also good.The hostess is very gentleman, the waitress and very kind.The food is ready on the table very fast.The presentation of the food is impecable.I love the vibes is the kitchen and announcing the next dishes that are ready to be served... very authentic Italian people! As it should be!The decoration is elegant, modern, cozy.Indoor and outside options to eat. I prefer the one inside close to the indoor (less noise from the Stree).Great selection of good wines.I will go back!",
      "My wife and I tried Doma for the first time recently because of all the great reviews and friend recommendations.  Overall the experience was just OK and certainly did not live up to all the positive reviews and reputation.The wine list was very underwhelming.  I have a big issue with the 4x - 6x markup on wine.  I understand it's a restaurant and there's a profit margin but 2x-3x should be enough and is the typical norm.  A $50 retail wine shouldn't be marked up to $400 at a restaurant like they do at Doma.  Maybe it could be justified if the wine was actually good but the wine list is mostly low rated wines.  As for the food, it's just OK.  I can't say it's bad but It's certainly nothing special.  We had the fried artichokes, the tuna tartar, the truffle pasta, and the beef ragu pasta.  The fried artichoke was decent.  The tuna tartar was very light on tuna and heavy on the avocado.  I am not sure why everyone is raving about the truffle pasta.  It's very basic pasta that's cooked with a heavy dose of truffle oil and then topped off with truffles.  Absolutely nothing special.  The beef ragu pasta was very, very al dente.  I think the pasta was simply undercooked.  The ragu itself was decent.  Huge caveat, we moved to Miami from Boston so perhaps we got used to a certainly level of Italian food.Overall, not a place I would recommend or come back to.  Nothing here is bad but certainly not worth the price and the hype.",
      "My boyfriend and I have been there multiple times on date night and with friends. Such great vibes and atmosphere. Great service and delicious food!",
      "Unfortunately this restaurant did not meet my expectations. Being a foodie and an Italian cuisine lover with Italian roots the food was quite disappointing. The two different risotto dishes were served way too al dente. The salmon dish portion was ridiculously small and very basic. For the service (as some other guests shared and did not lie) each employee here is trained rush rush rush rush rush you out!!! The hostess was constantly walking around restaurant removing plates without asking if one is finished with their dish, the waiters assistant, also, pulling plates off table while still eating. Had to bring it to their attention. The waiter was very impatient and rushed us to order main dishes when we wanted to enjoy a few drinks with appetizers prior to our main dishes. Experience, food and service did not fit the bill. Sad to say that I will not be revisiting this restaurant again.",
      "Incredible!!! Modern Italian restaurant tucked away in Wynwood. Everything was spectacular. The meatballs doma and caprese burrata were the perfect appetizers. The cacio and Pepe was insanely delicious, pasta was perfectly al dente.  I ordered the risotto with veal ossobucco but felt the veal was a little too fatty for my liking. Only down side is the bar is very small so when We arrived a bit early to our reservation and were offered to wait at the bar the bar was extremely crowded with diners seated having a meal at the bar so we were unable to order our drinks",
      "Hidden in the most unexpected spot of wynwood. The place is chic modern and the service is top notch. The food is really good! All the desserts are to die for, especially the pistachio gelato!! The soft egg is incredible, and the truffle pasta is full of intense truffle buttery flavors and perfectly cooked. I highly recommend this place!"

      "Super cool industrial chic bakery in the heart of Wynwood. You would think you are in Brooklyn! This spot has the Michelin Bib Gourmand, and after trying some of their goods I can see why. The apple turnover was a perfectly delicate and crispy pastry filled with morsels of heavenly apple and topped with a crumble. I also tried their sourdough wheat loaf, and loved the chewy interior balanced with a crunchy bread crust. As I had my first bite, I thought - finally I had found THE bread in Miami! Lastly I had the cinnamon bun, which was the perfect balance of soft dough, cinnamon flavor and icing. A very refined experience for a cinnamon bun, and a pleasant surprise that it wasn't overly sweet. Bang on. Already looking forward to the next time I visit Zak the Baker!",
      "i was a regular customer of ZAK THE BAKER..have been since the beginning and all through the pandemic...always have enjoyed the restaurant/bakery up until recently...they have made changes to their menu and are TOTALLY UNACCOMMODATING!!sandwiches are PRE PREPPED and they WILL NOT accommodate even the slightest reguest...i ordered the tuna melt and asked for the tomato to be removed and they refused!!! (it's difficult to remove a soggy tomato after its been heated and the cheese has melted!!!)i don't want to know that the sandwiches are pre prepped in the morning, for that i can go to starbucks!!!the avocado toast now has PEAS added as filler!!!the mushroom toast was heavy and way too rich...i adore the pastries, but sometimes you just want eggs on a croissant...it's been a nice ride, but i'll take my business elsewhere!!",
      "Paid $14 for a tiny salad and has to sit next to a homeless person outside. After I notified two diff employees and managers of the person laying down on one of the benches they did absolutely nothing. Every bite I took was accompanied by a whiff of this man. I finally just got up and left. Super gross and unprofessional. The audacity to charge those prices for low quality food and service  completely deters me from this business altogether.",
      "This place is worth the hype. They have a variety of handmade  breads and delicious coffee. I had the toast with ricotta and mushrooms, and it was divine. Great flavors. I thought it was a great portion and filling. They get quite busy, I would recommend sitting inside and watching the magic happen. Take some bread home for the road.",
      "Cool spot for breakfast as it is like you are within the bread factory itself. There are multiple toast options and coffee for all tastes to eat at the place or to go. They also have bread and bakery goodies to take home that are quite good. Love the little box of ruggelag to have with your coffee.As it it close to Wynwood heart you could actually have a stroll before or after your food for a fun day out",
      "Popular brunch spot in Wynwood known for breads/pastries. Came here on a Sunday around noon and we were a group of 6. We waited for an hour and there was a steady line of people waiting for takeout and dine-in (there's separate lines). A friend highly recommended this place and judging by the number of people, a lot of others also seem to like this spot. They send you a text when your table is ready. Credit cards accepted. We got a slice of the banana bread to split and it was a chunky piece. I got the salmon rilette which had an interesting flavor profile. The bread was hearty and I did finish that, but not the rilette. The breakfast sandwich came with a salmon strip rather than bacon, which was a choice. The tuna melt was yummy.",
      "There's nothing like good bread. Bread so good you want to press down on the plushness of the air pockets and feel it bounce back up, bread so good there is a nice chew and a depth of flavor so intense you want to leave it in your mouth for just a moment longer before swallowing it into oblivion. That's the kind of bread I sought at my visit to Zak the Bread, so celebrated for his baking skills he was named a James Beard finalist in the best baker category. Between danishes, croissants, and cookies there was plenty to choose from, but I got one of his famous tuna melts, made on their sourdough country wheat bread. It was toasted to perfection and filled with melted cheddar, tarragon, cranberries, and their house made tuna salad. It was a solid sandwich all around. I think I might be a little spoiled by all the New York bakeries I live around, but I wasn't too excited about the rest of the menu, which seemed overly basic for someone who can probably do it all. There is something to be said about keeping it simple and just executing very well though, and that's something they do in spades here.",
      "Stopped by 2x while i visiting Miami and stayed in the area.Mushroom toast was delicious!Also for the salmon and cheese pastry & Guava pastry were great too! Everyone was friendly. I will return!",
      "I was hesitant to stop by due to the reviews below. But I trusted my instincts and decided to give it a try. What's the worst that can happen.....right?  Well let me tell you we loved it. The service was great waiter was very attentive. I think it's so cool to have the bakery out in the open for you to see while enjoying your meal. The ambiance is airy and chill. We started with an iced coffee and the cappuccino. Both were brought to our table and were great. We ordered the breakfast sandwich on sourdough and the nova. For pastries we got the cinnamon bun and the almond croissant. We split the sandwiches and this is my rating based on our meal. 1. Nova 10/10 - the lox was fresh and delicious 2. Breakfast sandwich 8/10- I expected more flavor the eggs should have some salt and pepper sprinkled on top, but the salmon bacon was fantastic3. Cinnamon Bun 9/10 - We loved the flavors, but wished it was warmed up 4. Almond croissant 8/10 - it was delicious, there's an almond filling which I didn't expect and it was a bit too sweet. But it's fluffy, flaky and almonds all overOverall we had a great experience, looking forward to stopping by again. We buy their breads all the time to enjoy at home. Make sure you stop by and I hope you enjoy your experience as much as we did .",
      "My friend who lives in Miami Beach told me to stop here. It was quite busy around 10:15am on a Tues. I got my hands on a cinnamon bun straight out of the oven and it was delicious! Hubs got a huge pain de chocolat."

      "Amazing steakhouse Our favorite was the the Australian Wagyu which I can only say was perfection. their sides were so perfectly complimentary. Truffle Mac and cheese, the Brussels sprouts, spinach, broccolini and cauliflower were excellent. Beef lettuce wraps were decent, beet salad was good, kids meals were devoured. ALSO if you're here for breakfast their buffet is great",
      "WOW - To say I was completely blown away by my first time dining here would be an understatement. Whether you're celebrating a special occasion or just craving a delectable meal that will leave you speechless, this is the spot that will be sure to leave a lasting impression. From the lavish and trendy decor, the out of this world dishes, beautiful presentations and impeccable service, every detail was taken well into consideration and perfected.I can say with certainty that this is one of the most gorgeous spaces I've ever eaten a meal in. The sultry vibe, elegantly designed interior, endless display of wine bottles scattered throughout the restaurant and the stunning bar will have you feeling like you're in the midst of dining amongst celebrities. There didn't seem to be a bad table to dine at in sight, but my parents and I were lucky enough to snag one of the beautiful half-moon booths toward the center of the room. When is the last time you've been to a restaurant that brings complimentary French fries to the table? And not just any regular ole' French fries, but a delicious trio of French fries each complimented by their own unique dipping sauce? Bet it's probably never happened before, unless you've eaten here. I thought this was such a neat but simple touch that really set them apart from other high-end restaurants. They also bring yummy rolls topped with sea salt to the table (between the fries & the bread, you might end up in a food coma before you even order if you're not careful). I ordered the tuna tartar for an appetizer and I was in heaven every time I took a bite. Not only does it melt in your mouth, but the presentation alone is enough reason to order this (the way they mix it for you makes for a fun video opportunity if you have your phone ready to record). My parents shared a shrimp cocktail that they both enjoyed - The shrimp were massive! Following the appetizers, I munched on a cesar salad which was perfectly dressed. Now... the STEAK. Holy moly, one of the best filet mignons I have had yet. It was ridiculously flavorful, tender & juicy. Melted in your mouth and bursted with flavor. If you're a steak lover, it would be a crime to come here and not order it. The mashed potatoes that accompanied it were also flavorful, but I thought they were a little too runny (my only complaint of the whole meal). If you're a fan of grilled onions, do yourself a favor and order a side of these to top your steak with and thank me later. The \"Smoked Chocolate S'mores\" dessert was ridiculously decadent and was the perfect finish to an impeccable meal. Yes, it's insanely pricy and yes, it's totally worth it. My experience here was one of the best dining experiences I've ever had in Miami - And that says a lot given the fact that Miami is one of the hottest spots in the country for foodies. This restaurant hit it out the park for me and I'm already searching for an excuse to go back to South Florida and to savor new dishes on their menu.",
      "The restaurant is spacious and nice. Bar is nice as well.Staff was friendly and attentive.For appetizers the tuna tartare was fresh and seasoned well.They also bring you French fries 3 different ways with 3 different sauces. I had the certified Angus rib cap cooked medium rare and It was good and flavorful. The side of Mac and Cheese was good as well.",
      "Our favorite was the the Australian Wagyu which I can only say was perfection.",
      "Ambiance was awesome. The dishes, coctails and the dessert were so delicious. All the employees were so polite and friendly. They celebrated our honeymoon with a cute card, it was so nice.They made our special day unforgettable.",
      "Wonderful experience! Fabulous service. Timing, everything was a 10.  Our server really made our night fabulous, she was awesome. Great steak, Mac and cheese with truffle was really nice. Molten cake was super good as well. I must say everything was impeccable.",
      "Phenomenal cuisine. Never have a enjoyed such a succulent and flavourful sea bass - it is one of their renowned specials. But the lack of bones in the fish was made up for by the pained bones in my rear.The decor was beautiful but very far from comfortable. The low chairs were too uncomfortable for eating. The benches; built for slaves.The overall experience was truly hampered by a god awful designer deserving of life in prison for her domestic terror on comfort. 4/5 not bad",
      "This plus is amazing! We had a private room & our server was Erin. Erin was very pleasant, patient, informative & very professional. She suggested several appetizers & dinner. It was our first time visiting this restaurant & it definitely won't be our last.",
      "Food was incredible. I love that when you get to the table instead of getting some bread you get french fries. Service was also impeccable and ambiance is very family friendly in my opinion"

Incredible. - Tiramisu OMG - get it. - Tableside Caesar - Very nice server - Ben - Foccacia bread The good: - Meatball App - The wine cellar and steak presentation as you walk in is a nice touch General feedback: - Dimming the lights a bit more would give it some real ambiance and a homier feel  - They JUST opened so cut the staff some slack. I've been on a team opening a restaurant before and it's so hard. They did great! - Good location - easy access with ample parking. A local steakhouse is just what the neighborhood needs - The staff was really sweet and everyone was really working hard all night.",
      "Went here for a birthday dinner. They have a great menu with all sorts of selections.  Our waiter was pushy and rude.  We ordered a NY Strip, Branzino, Pasta Bolonaize, Filet Minan, truffle fries and salad.  The steaks were ordered medium well done.  All the food was good except the steaks.  They kept bringing back the steaks rare and the waiter was angry with nasty comments toward us.  If you go here avoid this guy.  We told the mgr who seemed surprised.",

      "Hello my name is Nick. Of course I'm from New York. I usually don't write reviews specially bad ones we got to this nice restaurant very gorgeous inside. The bread was delicious. I have to say the first course was a pasta dish we split. It had a Bolognese sauce on it it was served hot and good. Little did I know that was the highlight of a dinner. My steak came out first they cut it up which I wasn't crazy about but it was cold. my friends ordered a veal dish a special order. They accommodated them but the dish also was ice cold. The dish presentation was very nice but it being cold was definitely a problem. I must mention the sides to twice cook baked potato was a baked potato not twice cooked. The cream spinach was nice fresh baby spinach sautéed with melted cheese on top. The menu, said cream of spinach. I do wish they would get their act together, and I would even consider trying it again. The Decour is very elegant. It was Christmas Eve. We got there at 6:15 and it wasn't that busy. There was no excuse for the cold food. I must say I was very disappointed. My name is nick hogan.",

If you don't right you can catch the live music as the sun sets, and the restaurant transforms to a lounge. Totally worth coming Parking is tricky, and if you're not paying attention you might miss it as you drive by. But it's a gem worth coming back to.",
      "Seaspice is known to Miami locals as a very high end resturant, frequented by celebrities.  I have no idea why.  The service is pretty awful.  The drink runners are horrible.  It takes about 30 minutes for just a drink to be brought out to you.  The food is mediocre.  It is definitely NOT worth the price, which is very expensive.  I am giving two stars because the view is amazing.  Seaspice is right on the water and has a gorgeous ambiance.  You can watch yachts drive by and some will even pull up and park.  The other star is for the tres leches.  This dessert was AMAZING, I would go back just to eat it again.  But otherwise, Seaspice is nothing special.  Save your money.",
      "A place that tries to be high end but fails to deliver.Service ? Mediocre Food ? Below parFirst thing when you check in is they tell you that you have a 2 hr max(tacky)",
      "I read this was one of the best patio dining AND a hot spot for celebrities in Miami, so I had to go check it out on our recent travels to this area...Initially I was worried about our luggage situation, as we had to carry our luggage to the restaurant since this was our last stop in Miami. However, they were very accommodating, and let us store some of our stuff in the closet, and we kept the big luggage with us, near our table.As expected, the patio scene was spectacular...city skyline and seaside views, with plenty of yachts passing by! The place indeed had that chic celebrity vibe...truly FAB! Loved the music overhead as well. Somehow, I expected some snobbiness...but not at all. Service was great!Then the food. OMFG...I've had some amazing foods lately, but this takes the cake. Even the complimentary bread was amazing (and unique)! My husband ordered this Wagyu Burger, and I chose this Ragu Pappardelle ( THE best Ragu Pappardelle I've ever had...EVER. ). Then this Pavola dessert...again, just beyond delish. Truly, this was foods for the celebrities.Honestly, I'm shocked at how low the rating is for this place. I assume that if the service isn't top notch, it would probably piss some folks off. The pricing was on the outlandish side...with even lunch entrees starting at around 40. There was even an appetizer item priced at around 70 bucks! Luckily, like I said, I felt that the foods and the service (and especially the spectacular ambiance) made up for it. There was this big yacht parked right near us, which somewhat blocked some of the views from the left. Still, we got our eyeful of seaside/yachtside views.In any case, this was a great way to end our trip in Miami.",
      "Went here with a group of girlfriends for brunch and everything was delicious, they were super accommodating as well.I had the froze , a cucumber and gin cocktail and 2 grey goose and sodas and all were fantastic.As a table we split the fresh fish and a couple sides and it was delicious. Also love the free bread It is definitely on the pricier side overall tbh but great for a fun \"fancy\" brunch",
      "Came here for Miami spice and although we spent more than we thought we would, we had a good time. Everything was delicious. The kale Caesar had pecans and Granny Smith apple slices, never had a Caesar like this but it was a nice change! The Shrimp Pesto Whole Wheat Spaghetti was my favorite, even though I'm not the biggest fan of pesto. The burger was good too just a little messy from the truffle aioli. The chocolate cremoso and tres leches was very good but I'd go with the cremoso for the cocoa nib crumble, yum! All in all, I think it's overpriced and I probably won't come here again because of that. The cheapest bottle of Chardonnay was $75 and most drinks were $20. I only came here for Miami spice and still spent almost $200.",
      "Given we still have Miami Spice going on until the end of the month we decided to try out the lunch menu @ Seaspice gorgeous location on the Miami River, sitting outdoor is really relaxing, so beautiful to watch the boats go by, really lovely To start we had the Comte' Cheese Soufflé, I have to admit this was a bit disappointing, it really did not have the texture of a real soufflé  but then............ the Shrimp Pesto Whole Wheat Spaghetti and the Pan-Seared Chilean Seabass were really good as dessert, both the Tres Leches and the Chocolate Cremoso were yummy Try it out before Miami Spice ends, you can check out the Miami Spice Menus on miamiandthebeaches.com@seaspicemia",

Sit outside in the courtyard enjoy your food and a drinks while watching the boats go by, just beautiful We had the Miami Spice lunch which has a very affordable fix price 3 course menu for $ 28, unfortunately this will end soon, nevertheless, I would defiantly go back again for sureRegarding the Miami Spice menu only one observation, they should have had more than one choice for the Entrees without the extra charge, right now you have 4 choices and 3 of these have extra charge on it, not really fair given that you are promoting the Spice menu, you should have at least two or three choices included in the price and one or two with the extra charge We had had Prince Edward Island Mussels, Grilled, the Grilled Faroe Island Salmon and the Profiteroles and Peaches and Cream. My favorite where the Mussels, the garlic pizza bread they brought for the table was absolutely delicious, the Salmon was good too. I had the Peaches for dessert and it was ok, not really my thing, my friend said the Profiteroles were great, next time I will not opt for the healthy dessert We enjoyed all with a good Albariño wine, our experience was made especially enjoyable by our waiter Fabrizio, he was really great ! Thank you Fabrizio @seaspicemia",

It's a great way to try out various restaurants and a unique spread of menu options. Seaspice was on my radar and happened to be one of the participating restaurants offering the Miami Spice menu. I contacted the restaurant in advance and made a reservation for 3:30p for a party of four. My mom who is from out of town was excited to join us for lunch. I advised the restaurant we were doing the Miami Spice menu. The restaurant made it clear that they charge $50pp for No Shows. At 3:15pm, we arrived for our reservation. The hostess Karin greeted us, and advised us that they were running behind on the reservations and because of this they will not be able to offer the Miami Spice menu. Only the a la-carte menu will be offered. This was a bit upsetting because we drove almost an hour to get there and the restaurant is refusing to offer the Miami Spice promotion. Our natural instinct was to just say forget it we will go somewhere else. I mean, at the end of the day who wants to beg to spend their money? It's absurd. If the restaurant is offering a promotional menu and because to no fault of our own they are running behind why should we be penalized?My Mom looked so bummed out. Because she was so excited to try this place. I decided to walk back in and ask for a Manager. The Manager took 20min to come out. When he finally did come over, he introduced himself as Collin. I explained to him what was going on and it seemed as though he wasn't aware that the hostesses were turning Miami Spice customers away. He decided to make it right and advised Karin to honor the Miami Spice menu. Impressive! Things were turning around. Besides the encounter at the hostess stand, the restaurant is beautiful. It is situated on Miami's waterfront were you can view the million dollar yachts passing by. They also have docks for those interested in docking and dining. You can view the downtown city skyline which I am sure looks amazing at night.The food was excellent. The Miami Spice menu offered a three course lunch for $28. You have the choice of a starter (Kale Salad, Cheese Souffle, or White Gazpacho). A choice of entrees (Seabass, Chicken Breast, Shrimp Pesto Pasta, Wagyu Burger, or Plant Bowl). And a choice of dessert (Tres Leches or Chocolate Cremoso). They also offer the option to add a Glass of wine for and additional $12. I ordered the Comte Cheese Souffle, the Green Circle Farms Chicken Breast, and the Tres Leches. The others in my party ordered the Kale Salad, Gazpacho, and Seabass. For starters, My favorites were the Kale Caesar Salad and Cheese Souffle. The Kale Caesar had a mix of shredded Granny Smith apples, pecans and a creamy Caesar dressing. The cheese Souffle was like a fluffy egg Souffle with a cream parmesan sauce and tomato chutney. Delicious!For entrees, both the Seabass and Chicken breast were amazing. The Chicken breast was tender and juicy, served on top of a creamy polenta and topped with corn, peas, and mushrooms. The seabass was seared nicely to give a nice crunch on the outside, while perfectly flaky and moist on the inside. It was served with stewed garbanzo, Swiss chard, and smoked potato. For desserts, we all had Tres Leches. It was served in a small Mason jar topped with 3 milks, and berries. Perfect way to end the meal. The portions are not large but it is filling. The flavors are fresh and very well balanced. The food presentation was notable. The Watermelon Tequila drink was delightful and refreshing. The froze was also a big hit. The cocktails were presented well and created perfectly. We enjoyed everything. Our waiter, Austin was very friendly. He made great recommendations and was very attentive.An 18% gratuity was added to the tab. There are lots of street parking accessible. In the end, the food was great. Ambience was amazing. The hostesses can use additional customer service training and learn to use better judgment to improve the customers experience. There was no need to escalate the matters to a manager. It could have been handled properly by showing empathy, apologizing, and finding a solution to the problem.",
      "Hi Kim,Thank you for dining with us and leaving a detailed review. It has been forwarded to our management team. Our apologies for the confusion at the door.  Glad to hear Collin accommodated you and your experience was turned around.  We are happy to see your great feedback regarding the food, cocktails, and Austin’s Service.  Hopefully you will join us again in the near future!",
      "This is my second time going to sea spice & I normally love it as the first time. I never leave bad reviews But this second time MY PHONE WAS STOLEN AND SECURITIES DID NOThing about it. Instead we're trying to blame me for the situation. I'm not drunk nor was drunk. I walked in with 2 phone and walked out with 1.We came as my friend USUALLY does and this is how they treated us  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME. I thought it was 5 star so nothing could go wrong. With a security right next to our table my phone STILLL got stolen. It was on the table. And to whoever has the time to steal phones is just sad imagine what else they can steal... I wil ask to review cameras but with the way I was treated when I let them know I lost my phone I doubt they will be helpful but I'll let every platform form of review know that they steal phones here. I know the exact time frame as well so they wouldn't even have to look much at the cameras. Let's see. BTW I BEEN HOME SICK AFTER EATING THESE OYSTERS I COULDNT Even celebrate my baby's birthday w him.",
      "Came here for my birthday dinner with my boyfriend for a 7:15 reservation (we called in advance for an outdoor seat dock side) we waited about ten minutes after our arrival for our table to be ready at the bar, the short wait was definitely worth it. Started with an aperol spritz at the bar then ordered octopus and gazpacho to start. Octopus portion was good but the olive oil tasted burnt since it came out on a sizzling hot cast iron looking skillet (its very easy to overcook octopus, please just bring a regular plate next time.) I also had the whole main lobster. Extremely delicious large portion of perfectly cooked and seasoned lobster, bravo. My boyfriend had the truffle coated Chilean sea bass and he absolutely loved it. Vibe: 5/5 this place definitely is a scene but not overwhelmingly pretentious or obnoxious. Absolutely loved the music as well. Service:3/5 A bit slow, our server was very attentive when we were able to get his attention but we had to always wave him down. Food: 4/5 everything was honestly pretty good (octopus could've had a bit more attention to detail)",
      "Hi Liz,Thank you for celebrating your birthday with us!  We are so happy to hear you had a great experience and enjoyed the food.  Your feedback regarding the octopus has been sent to our chef. We look forward to seeing you again soon!"

      "Great local Mexican food with Wednesday and Friday taco specials for $2 bucks. The service is good and the venue looks nic. The ambiance is local friendly.",
      "My favorite Mexican in Miami!   Hands down the best Mexican and with recent upgrades it's even better.  It's a hole in a wall, next to a gas station with staff speaking almost no English.   90 percent of guests are Mexican, the food is no frills and reliably tasty.   Must visit but bring cash, as on some days (can't figure out the system) they do not accept credit cards.",
      "Miami River Cafe -  as authentic Mexican as they come in Miami.  When you are the only \"greengo\" every time you come in -  you know it's not your texmex cuisine.  My favorites are:  spicy guacamole ($8), all types of fajitas ($16-18) which come with rice, beans, mini-guacamole and tortillas, tacos ($1 on Tuesdays).   And did I mention it's only 10 mins from Brickell?   Two thumbs up.",
      "We ordered takeout from this restaurant on June 5, 2022 and what do I see on the bag? A LIVE ROACH. I'm more mind blown how neither the restaurant staff nor the delivery person noticed this. That's how careless they are and gives you an idea of how filthy that restaurant must be. STAY AWAY",
      "The food is not as tasty as Mexican food is supposed to be, the chicken quesadilla the chicken was dry and too hard with no flavor, the pico de gallo was not fresh, the burrito  was not ok as well, the beans hard and no seasoning at all.",
      "This place is a hidden gem. If you are longing for an authentic Mexican food, this place is for you. The portions are so generous and the quality of the food is top notch. Don't get mislead on how this place looks from outside. I am huge fan of chicken fajitas and hands down this place has the best fajitas ever. The service is excellent and even though the waiters couldn't speak English, they tried their best to communicate to us through Google voice translators and such. They were keen to make sure that we were completely satisfied. A must visit food place if you ever visit south Miami.",
      "Honestly an insult to Mexican cuisine. I ordered a Dozz XX it was flat. I ordered quedo fundido, the queso had to be Gum. The chorizo? Like ground pork and no seasoning. I ordered flautas, the chicken tasted like boiled chicken no seasoning, the beans were straight out of a can, and the rice? Diluted rice, not a single grain represented \"Mexican rice\". Last I ordered was the queso birria, it was dry and they gave us half a cup of sopa. Our biggest disappointment was the queso fundido. We took 1 bite each and didn't like it. When we asked to have it removed they said \"it doesn't matter if we took one bite, or didn't like it all, we still have to pay\". I am so disappointed. If you are Mexican as myself, do not come here. This was the worse in Miami.",
      "No, don't do it! Avoid!I recently came to this place due to finding it on Yelp and it looked good. After coming here, I am sad to say Yelp let me down for once lol I ordered the milanesa de res torta and tacos. I tried ordering just one but was told it has to be 2 or 3 tacos so I got 2. The tacos come with just the tortilla and the meat, we were never told about the topping bar but saw it before we started eating. Meat wasn't great tasting. WORST MILANESA TORTA EVER. The breading was weird and not crispy or anything, meat was tough, hard to chew and had fat pieces. At the end the server decided to tell us it was CASH ONLY. Beware!!! They were no signs or anything so we were forced to use their atm and get charged a $3 fee for debit. I would skip the trip here, no impressed.",
      "Actually called Miami River Mexican Cuisine.Really good tacos and burritos, Wednesday and Friday is cash only and the tacos are worth $2 with an all you can fit in them buffet (only spices lol). Ambient is very pleasant.",
      "I've driven by this spot SO many times over the years but recently decided to finally pull over and check it out (not gonna lie: the Cat logo definitely swayed me). The small hole-in-the-wall exterior is a bit deceptive. Once you enter, you realize the restaurant is large, airy & oddly, a bit of a hipster vibe with the decor. Traditional Mexican flays & pottery mix with large portraits of Frida Kahlo & El Chapulín Colorado (!). Our waitress was lovely & very attentive. We decided to try their natural lemonade (DELICIOUS), the Guacamole (obvy) & Queso Fundido (hold the chorizo, please!). While we waited for our starters, we perused the menu and realized that we were in luck! From Wed-Fri, they offer Taco Specials ( $1.50!!!) I chose the Nopal & the Calabazita. Unbeknownst to me, \"calabazita\" is zucchini to them & not actual pumpkin as expected but VERY tasty! They sear the vegetable beautifully with a bit of onion, tomato & light seasoning. Just delicious! For our mains (truth be told, I was already full but NEEDED to try more. Can't help it... I have a problem with over-ordering). My father went with the Tampiqueña (Grilled Churrasco, 2 Enchiladas, Mexican Sausage, Charred Jalapeño, Rice, Beans & Tortillas). I had originally ordered the Chile Relleno de Vegetales but they were out so I webt with the Tacos de Camarón instead. Everything was so good & so fresh. Great little spot near the Miami River with SUPER reasonable prices that I absolutely plan to visit again soon! Tip: forget the green sauce they offer & go for the red instead!",
      "So this lowkey Mexican spot is THE Mexican spot to go to if you want some AMAZING and AUTHENTIC Mexican street tacos. Being a California girl, my taco standards are VERY VERY high. I will say, these are hands down the best street tacos in Miami!! They are definitely giving Cali street taco vibes, which is very hard to find here. It's right next to a mechanic shop so it's kind of hard to spot when trying to find it. But once you walk in, it's like a little Mexico. The decor is amazing and vibrant, the tacos are 10/10, and the beer is well priced. I had some carne asade (steak) and pork tacos, queso dip, elote, and Mexican beers. On Friday's they have $1 tacos which is a great deal for these amazing tacos. I was so excited to eat that I didn't even take any pictures. I'll definitely be visiting this place again, especially on a Friday!!"

      "Thank you",
      "I came here for karaoke on a Wednesday and we had a good time. This spot is very interesting. It's a small \"bar\" with open seating and a full menu. You definitely have some good options to choose from. There's an area where you can play games like oversized Jenga. This spot is definitely a vibe I'll tell you that. The setup is a bit weird since the space is split up into almost 3 parts; the main area with the bar and karaoke, the area with the games is a few steps down, then there's a partition separating the food pickup alongside extra seating. It was hard to hear the music and karaoke even from the bar. The reason I say \"bar\" is because they don't serve spirits. The closest thing is sake and it's only in one of their mixed drinks (the drop the mic Miami drink). It was good but most of their mixed drinks are based from canned drinks, house wine, or beer. Ordering food and drinks is chaotic especially when there is only one person at the bar serving drinks and taking orders. He was nice but spread so thin and patrons had to suffer. I honestly believe they should separate food and drink orders (like food orders should only be by mobile order). Food is okay. I had the chicken Philly which I would recommend and the mini empanadas. I tried both beef and chicken and couldn't tell the difference.",
      "Nice to find a free comedy club in Miami . I must say that most of them were brand new as a stand up comedians and a few were really seasoned .They serve food at this location and have beer and wine . I got the draft beer for 5 but my friend picked a beer from a case and this was 10.00 . My friend was over charged for an extra beer but did not discover it till later on the next day . I like how especially they pick on people ,my friend was called a crazy girl  and truth is she really is a lot of fun . They asked me if I was looking for a guy and I'm married ,no thank you one man is enough.Over all it was a fun night and I would like to come back one day.  Parking is across the street .",
      "This place has everything you need, especially if you're going to a Miami Marlins game. Free parking with walking distance to LoanDepot Park, a pregame spot with 8 beers from breweries all over the place on draft, more beer, hard seltzer and canned cocktails in their fridge, a full bar food menu with $2 tacos during their happy hour from 6-8 pm, not to mention discounted beers during said happy hour. And open until 1 am to let you continue hanging with your friends after the game!I've had their mushroom tacos as well as their queso frito taco for a quick bite before the game. The mushroom tacos are strongly seasoned but that taste can be cut by the chopped onions and lime that come with it, and the queso frito taco had good heft to it. When I asked if my friends and I can take our beers to go, they gave us solo cups to take roadies. Such a helpful offering to make the 10 minute walk better lol!We returned after the game, and since it was Wednesday karaoke night, we were inspired to sign up and sing some songs! The atmosphere was welcoming since everyone in the bar (about all 10 of them, I mean it was a Wednesday) were enthusiastically getting up to sing. Whether it's group and single person karaoke, the DJ and the bar goers made it fun. We also played Cards Against Humanity against each other since they have a bunch of board games available, which again, is always a good time.My friend who doesn't drink beer much even found a blackberry sour that she liked. See, there's something for everyone here! With all the themed nights they host (karaoke, comedy night, crafts), there's a reason to come to Little Havana even when the Marlins aren't playing. See you there!",
      "I came here for pre-dinner drinks and I stayed for dinner and drinks. When I walked in, I was greeted my the owner who was friendly. I came during happy hour but the place was empty. I got to chat with the owner and his wife. They are cool people. He told me he has owned the place for 10 months after leaving his food truck business. They now have a thriving business going. Anyways, I grabbed the Bacardi mango mojito drink can from the fridge and it was a refreshing drink. I had the sweet potatoes fries for appetizers. The fries were ok. For happy hour, they have $2 tacos. I ordered 2 ground beef tacos and a Queso Frita taco per the recommendation of the owner's wife. I'm glad I did. The tacos come on a corn tortilla with meat (or the substitute), onion and cilantro with a slice of lime.  It wasn't too bad for the price. Let's talk about the decor of the place. The walls are painted by artists. The lights in there are cool too. It brings a whole vibe. They have different activities during the week like game night, trivia night, comedy's night, etc...",
      "Cute little spot great place to see comedy and eat. The thank you pb&j burger is delicious. And the pineapple sake martini was so good with the sugar rum couldn't stop drinking it. Love supporting our local small business community. The service was great and quick as well.",
      "Thank you !",
      "Came here this past Friday to celebrate my birthday and so glad we did.The place itself is really cute and decorated in true Miami fashion. I also love that they have murals on the walls and tables where they call out the artists. It seems that the owners put a lot of love into this place and it really shows. We were happy to find out that when we got there they had happy hour going on until 8 so we grabbed a few drinks and noticed they had some games and old school Nintendo which was really fun and nostalgic.On Friday nights that have a comedy show which was really funny and something different. During the comedy show there was the option to purchase wristbands that let you have bogo beers all night. I also saw they have karaoke on Wednesdays and open mic nights so looks like we'll be coming back for those!They also have food which is good but what's even better is how delicious it is! The Parmesan truffle fries and Brussels sprouts hit the spot and was the perfect munchie food but they also have burgers, empanadas and chicken if you come with a big appetite.I love how Thank You Miami is a true mom and pop shop with Alex and his wife Jo running the show. They definitely won us over and we will definitely be back!",
      "Thank you so much !!!!!!",
      "Low key spot with amazing food and really good beer! The music is always amazing and the decor is very Miami. The owner provides great service and makes everyone feel welcomed. They also have great entertainment throughout the week. If you're in the area (or not) come check them out!",
      "Fun little bar near Marlin's stadium, ideal to meet up with friends prior to games. You can park in their garage for free and leave your car there while you attend the game... its only a couple blocks away so its not bad at all.. they have fun happy hour special's, including beers & cocktails... they also have a fridge with variety of seltzers..",
      "This place is a total vibe now. Super sad I moved away when a great spot like this just really started hitting its stride in MIA. but that's ok! Now you all get to go and enjoy! The staff are legit, super friendly, and welcoming, the food is good and there is not only parking available BUT IT IS FREE PARKING. Additionally, the parking is COVERED. WHAT!!???? yep. And get this, get this ya'll - they advertise for you to come in and park to walk over to the Marlins game. Stop sleepin' on Thank You Miami, come over - grab a few brews and enjoy the vibe.",

It was made to perfection, the chicharrón de pollo was crispy and delicious with the onion vinaigrette. Support this local gem! This restaurant is very similar to Pio Pio in NYC for reference.",
      "Elena greeted us wholeheartedly when we brought our tired and soaked bodies into the establishment. After being seated on the second floor, we couldn't help but request the AC to be turned off as we were wet, and this request was met swiftly. Elena also provided us with six hot, small, delicious, complimentary chicken soups that warmed our bodies and hearts.In a party of six, we ordered Castigame Negra with a side dish of fried sweet potato, Alitas Del Senor De Los Milagros, and Chicharronada Bailable. The sweet potato was amazing, especially with the condiments provided (my favorite was Rotoco), so we ended up ordering another one. My favorite were the grilled chicken parts and veal hearts of Castigame Negra. Our party were extremely satisfied with other dishes too. I personally prefer eating chicken to beef in this establishment.I recommend this place to anyone, to Miami locals and tourists.",
      "Chicken was amazing, very moist and tender. I would recommend eating here, they are not great a listening to the directions on meal delivery. Portions were a little small for the price.Sister restaurant still much better.",
      "Nice place. Came by here with some family while on a trip in Miami. Great service. Chicken was amazing. Nice and juicy. We also had some rice and fries and yuca fries as well. They accommodated one of my cousins who is vegan with some delicious broccoli  Overall great dining experience would recommend eating here if you are ever in the neighborhood.",
      "Delicious casual place in Downtown miami.  Nice outdoor seating to people watch & enjoy the weather.  The service is friendly, but a little slow in taking orders and bringing the food.  It's faster if you sit indoors.  I had the aji amarillo ceviche and loved it, my friend had the classic ceviche and enjoyed it as well.   I would come again, i'm curious to try the chicken next.",
      "Man, I am happy I picked this place. Came to downtown Miami for work without knowing much. Just picked this place cause I was craving some authentic latin cuisine and was close to my hotel. Was surprise by the quality of the food! By the way, they serve the Ceviche from the restaurant next door, I also had the carne assada with rice. The service was also top notch and very welcoming and attentive.",
      "We decided to come give it a try after we heard someone say that their chicken was really, really good. This place does not disappoint.   When you are seated, they give you a taste of their specialty soup, which was fantastic. My husband and I ordered the half chicken which was enough for both of us. The meat was tender. The service was on par, and the experience was great.  We",
      "Anything less than a 5 star rating for this bombastic combo of mouthwatering food and elite level service. From the second I walked through the door I was greeted with genuine friendliness. Place is decorated in a cool way but that's just a small detail compared to everything else. First off Jorge took care of us like we were royalty. Above and beyond doesn't even begin to describe it, he should really be teaching servers how to make guests feel special because that's what he seems to do. Anyway, the food. The Mexico Lindo y Querido drink I offered was perfectly blended and balanced. Just the right amount of pineapple flavor. The appetizer we got wasn't on the menu but we went with Jorge's suggestion and we are so glad we did. It was a ceviche blended with avocado leche de Tigre shrimp and lobster. Jaw-dropping flavor, i mean like the best tasting ceviche I've had in years. Then we ordered the Tiradito clásico, and it was also a show-stopper, it was delicious down to the very last drop. I had to try the pollo so I got the 1/4 chicken and rice with salad. You'd think it would be ordinary since the ceviche seems to be the star but you'd be wrong because the chicken was tender and juicy, and the sauces they bring to the table are unbelievably good. Drown your chicken in it! You'll love it. I'd get a bottle if I could to go. This place is going to be a regular stop for me in MIA.",
      "Pretty solid Peruvian restaurant. I ordered the Saltado Mixto from Uber Eats and it was pretty satisfying. I will say though that my tastebuds were a little sensitive to the salt in this dish, but it was still very tasty. It was hearty meal, given that they served both fries and rice. I was one happy, sleepy girl once I finished it. I can't wait to dine in at this restaurant the next time I'm in town!",
      "The best peruvian food in Miami without a doubt. Service is great and everyone is very friendly. The food comes out quickly and is absolutely incredible. We split 4 plates among 4 people and everything was delicious including the lomo on fire, classic ceviche, la Tia veneno, and the acevichado roll. Sister restaurant to ceviche 105 which is right nextThe best part is it is all for a very reasonable price. I came here after a beach day and can't wait to come back."

Finger licking good!!!  Then we ordered the dolsot bibimba and the bulgogi with lettuce. These two dishes are a must if you're dining at this spot. The service was also really good- our server was super friendly. I will definitely come back to Fuchai to get my Korean food fix.",

Spectacular service from a super friendly waiter. I had the bulgogi, which comes with a side of rice.  Somewhat smallish portions but delicious.",

      "I took my mother there for her birthday as we craved Korean food. It was amazing! I have been lookin for good Korean food in miami since I moved back from California, and this place hit the spot. I will definitely be going back.",
      "Oh my, oh my. This place was so good! I've been day dreaming about eating here again, my bf and I decided to make it tradition to come once a month to try the whole menu. The spot is small but clean and cute. Service was exceptional. I got the bimbap bowl and he got noodles, both dishes were great and servings were giant. Wish I took pictures."

      "TLDR: beautiful decor; trendy new spot from Major Food Group in a trendy area, overall good food! SETTING: made a reservation for a Tuesday night at 6pm (only time they had available when I booked, though there was several tables both outside and inside that were empty throughout our meal). As other reviews note, it is a very beautifully designed restaurant. Pink velvet couches, extravagant lighting, Italian music, plush green loungey chairs - overall a  beautiful setting and very comfortable, buzzy vibes.FOOD: We ordered the whipped ricotta, the trio of cured meats and pumpkin ravioli to start. For our mains, we had the bolognese, spicy lobster pasta, veal Milanese and lamb chops. Sides of broccoli and polenta.Everything was very tasty but the standout for me was the spicy lobster pasta. Creamy, delicious pink sauce, perfectly cooked and many nice pieces of lobster mixed in. The veal Milanese was also delicious- great tender meat, perfectly breaded with a nice side salad of arugula. Didn't get to try the bolognese or lamb chops but our friends definitely enjoyed as both plates were cleared.SERVICE: service was great, but as other reviews mention, they really do push you to order a ton of food (even though it might not be necessary as portion sizes are quite large).VERDICT: great place to enjoy a nice meal, but not necessary to go out of your way to come here.",
      "Tried going to Contessa today.. I didn't have a reservation. It was 4pm and there were many empty tables, but of course the hostess was not friendly at all and said they were fully booked (whatever that means). I am really tired of the awful hospitality in Miami, especially from Major Food Group restaurants. I don't get how they are so expensive and still treat us like they are doing us a huge favor. Its humiliating. Tired.",
      "Had an amazing dinner here the other night. Service was great and the restaurant was beautiful. We ordered:- whipped ricotta- artichoke salad - mushroom pizza - lobster capellini - bistecca fiorentina - veal Milanese- branzino (would skip this)- scallops- Creme anglaise dessert- pistachio gelato - chocolate cake Everything was delicious and so well-prepared. We will definitely be back!",
      "Dined here on Christmas Eve and I was really looking forward to trying Contessa! The restaurant itself is decorated very nicely and I love the lounge type seating that is available. The outside patios will be perfect once this cold front leaves. We were seated promptly and handed drink menus. A server came by and only offered us panna still or sparkling water. He made it seem as those were the only options for water and of course we learned later on that still water was $9 for the glass. That's just a shady business tactic that really left a sour taste once we got the check. We ordered the whipped ricotta, meatballs, truffle & prosciutto pizza, spicy lobster & pumpkin ravioli. The waiter then made a comment \"having a light dinner? Are you sure you don't want to order more as people usually order more courses\". I thought he was joking as it was only my fiancé and I. Also, if we want more we will order more. This seems to just be a way to make more money off diners. The meatballs never even came out so I guess you can say it was a \"light dinner\". The whipped ricotta was delicious. It's drizzled with honey and served with the perfect slices of crisp sourdough bread. The pumpkins ricotta had the perfect hint of sweetness to it. The truffle pizza left a lot to be desired. It was very simple with no outstanding flavors. We ended up spreading some ricotta on it. Spicy lobster was good and a nice portion for two people. I'd skip the jungle bird cocktail as it had an odd aftertaste. Mojito was good, but I'd stick to wine next time. For dessert, the gelato is a must. The pistachio was perfect and the vanilla was very rich. Crema inglese was delicious as well as the chocolate torta. I will say that it doesn't seem to make any sense that each dessert is the same price $18.I will give contessa another shot in a few weeks when they have worked out some of the customer service kinks.",
      "I loved Contessa! I went a couple of weeks ago with some friends and we had a great time! To begin with the service was impeccable from beginning to end! From the hostess to the server and everyone else in between. The restaurant is also very nice and was quite lively on a Friday. Our group ordered red wine, which was nice, I think it was a pinot noir, but not sure, nevertheless it was tasty, and easy drinking. All of our food was really good, but the standout for me was the lobster pasta so please be sure to get that! We also had a truffle pasta that was lovely and light. We also had a squash carpaccio, which was one of the most interesting, unique, and delicious things I've had in a while. Trust me, please also get it! Contessa to me was a different type of Italian food that I have never had or at least the flavors are a little different than the norm that you usually think, but I LOVED it and I cannot wait to be back!",
      "Almost any place can make a plate of pasta. There are even a few other good Italian places here in Miami where I've had the pleasure of indulging. But one place where Contessa stands out is service and attention to details. Case in point, Alex the GM was quick to bring out a fresh plate of roasted potatoes after our dish (intended as a side) came up ahead of the main course. Along with Maritza our server and the others in their team, it made for a top notch evening! This is certainly a place to come by and celebrate reunions with great friends and other special occasions, or just because!I came by with my friend Cecilia who was back visiting Miami continuing our Italian dinner tradition. Seeing that Contessa opened during Basel, I got to work on making a reservation.The space has high ceilings and very artistic chandeliers, along with a stair to (perhaps) an upstairs VIP area. It is decorated in pinks and has some loungey banquettes with comfy cushions. They were perfect for me to relax after enjoying their sweet and fresh moscato or  their \"Jungle Bird\". Basically an Italian mojito, this smooth blend of rum, campari, and tropical juices was a great introduction for the weekend.There may be have been an espresso martini in there as well :)The dinner menu is meant for sharing, and we started with their plate of creamy burrata, yummy grape tomatoes and crisp bread. Be sure to order one of their pizzas, such as the truffle one. Served creatively as either a panini or deep dish, this pie has a nice aroma without being overwhelming and is stuffed with perfectly salty prosciutto and melted mozza. You don't even have to be fancy and can eat it with your hands. Along with the aforementioned potato side, my main plate was the veal milanese. Perfectly pounded and lightly breaded, this was a large and tender beef filet that was meat nirvana. It was also accompanied on a bed of fresh greens. We ended up having half of it boxed for takeout. Remember to hold space for dessert, because their creme anglaise / deconstructed tiramisu is creamy and delicious. It even has a full lightly crispy anisete cookie!",
      "The ambiance is everything, the pink and green decor is beautiful! I met with friends at the bar, while we waited to be seated, where the very sweet bartender,prepared something for me (sorry, not sure the name). When our table was finally ready, again we where treated with another great server (self tip, remember their names for next time). We started off with the Whipped Ricottagrilled focaccia and Prosciutto San Daniele Ahhhmazing! We also had Carciofi salad, hubby normally is not into salads but this he loved. We had the pumpkin ravioli, to me personally it was ok. We also ordered shrimp mezaluna, Margherita pizza and the classic veal Milanese which was to die for and a must if you go visit! And to end we ordered the Crema Inglese Great experience, looking forward to going back with the rest of the family!",
      "Visited this restaurant to celebrate my annual holiday dinner with my best friends. The restaurant is located on the corner across Tesla in the art district. We had a reservation at 5:45pm but got there at 5pm and they were able to accommodate us.The place is absolutely gorgeous, the decor and ambiance will take you to Europe, but the great music will take you to Latinoamérica, the music is really good.It gets really cold, so if you are seating by the bar, a jacket will help.We ordered drinks, the bird jungle is not that good, the waiter gave me the option to change it. Our waiter was ok, he could have been more attentive. He did recommended some options.The food was absolutely delicious. The spicy lobster pasta was my favorite and it's out of this world. The whipped ricotta was my second favorite. The truffle pizza it's good too, but you can go without it.We shared everything, the chicken and the Rosmery potato's were good as well.I hope you come and enjoy this place as much as we did.",
      "Had my birthday dinner a few nights ago and I truly felt like I was transported to Italy. The inside was so pretty with their pink and green velvet chairs and couches and fresh flower arrangements everywhere. I loved every part of it. Our waiters were great and very knowledgeable of the menu and made some great recommendations. We tried the focaccia and Meatballs Aldo to start off and the whole grain mustard sauce and pickled onions were amazing! I've never had that combination on my meatballs and I don't want to have it any other way from now on. My partner and I were starving and trying not to eat with our eyes so we took it easy and shared the Cinghiale Bolognese and Salumi pizza. The bolognese was my absolute favorite and felt pretty light. The pizza was spicyyyyy. I love spicy but the chili oil had me coughing and chugging my drink lol now for my drink, I ordered the only tequila cocktail on the menu (besides the tequila martini) called The Venetian which was simple but amazing with a little cinnamon on top and grapefruit garnish. We really wanted to try the olive oil gelato but were kinda skeptical so we had the chocolate hazelnut cake instead and it really hit the spot. Maybe next time I'll go for the gelato but all in all it was a great night, shout-out to all the great and friendly employees!",
      "Ate at Contessa on a Thursday night with family. The ambiance is 5 stars as is the decor and service. Michael was excellent and a pleasure. He really goes out of his way to get to know his clients. We ordered: 1) Whipped Ricotta: came with a large portion of toasted sourdough bread, a generous portion of whipped ricotta and a drizzle of honey. Good for sharing. 2) Carciofi: well balanced, unique salad made with shaved artichokes, Parmesan and almonds. Was very impressed and would order it again. 3) Margherita Pizza: comes with buffalo mozzarella. Thin and crispy crust, cooked perfectly. Great appetizer for sharing or as a main. 4) Grilled Mediterranean Branzino: comes topped with a mountain of sliced green olives. Not a highlight. 5) Classic Veal Milanese: comes with a side of arugula salad and pickled onions. Meat was tender, cooked perfectly and crispy. 6) Negroni cocktail: classic but made well. Nice presentation and worth it. 7) Spritz Contessa: too sweet for our taste. Might be better for those who prefer sweet cocktails. Overall great experience. Will definitely return!"

      "1 word, excellent. My steak was cooked to perfection. I ordered it to be prepared medium and it was just that. Juicy and well seasoned. I paired it with the Brussels sprouts and they did not disappoint. I was running late for my reservation due to the weather and the staff were extremely accommodating. I appreciated that. Great restaurant experience.",
      "Thank you Zakiyya, we take great pride of our Argentine beef and we're so glad it shows!",
      "I really really loved Grazianos. The service was excellent. Food was phenomenal and bill wasn't bad. We started out with their delectable bread and chimichurri both made in house. The chimichurri was perfect with the right amount of greens and garlic. We then got the chefs special. The spinalis cut. Which is the cap of the rib eye. O. M. G. so soft and delicious. Presented beautifully on this grill plate with rosemary. After turning to our friends on Yelp, we opted for the mushroom truffle risotto, which was like a dream risotto and the Brussel sprouts, which had this excellent combination with pancetta. We had leftovers as well!! We loved their wines. We decided to try dessert. Upon asking our wonderful waiter Robert, we chose the dulce de leche crepes. The crepes were perfect and you could really taste the orange liquor which paired great with a cappuccino. Service was wonderful, food was great. Will definitely be returning.",

      "I first visited this Graziano's location more than a decade ago when this restaurant hosted an event to celebrate Yelp Miami's first anniversary.  Since then I've patronized this restaurant several times for both lunch and dinner, and all have been great experiences.Most recently two of us came here, were greeted right away, were offered hand sanitizer and we chose to sit at the bar, though if our dog is with us we always ask to sit on the covered patio out front.   Service was great from attentive staff, seating was separated in accordance with Covid-19 restrictions, the manager checked in with us a few times to ensure we were happy, and the food was great as always.On this visit, we both had a mojito to start. If Brian is working...tall, skinny manager, ask for him to make your mojito as they're pretty incredible and those drinks alone have caused us to return here!  For our meals, we started with an order of provoletta cheese, which is served hot and sizzling.  We then ordered the skirt steak and the ribeye to share, along with mashed potatoes and asparagus for our sides.   Everything was excellent as usual, and we had enough steak and potatoes remaining after we were full to take home for lunch the next day.There's a valet lot adjacent to this restaurant (I believe Graziano's validates), or street parking can usually be found on 8th Street within a few blocks from here.   With all the more trendy (and expensive) steak houses in Brickell proper, some may not think about this Grazianos just up the street, but the service and food are always solid, prices are reasonable considering the quality and portion sizes of the steaks and sides, and because it's not in the middle of Brickell, this restaurant also seems a bit more laid back and less manic.",
      "Thank you so much Paul! We're always happy to welcome returning customers! We are delighted that you and your guest were able to enjoy our dining and drink options. At Graziano's, we always strived to ensure we provide our customers with nothing short of the best experience and we are so glad that we delivered! See you soon!",
      "Delicious lunch!My family and I visited this place for Sunday lunch and definitely enjoyed it! We split the 4 empanada sampler: beef, ham and cheese, chicken, and veggie. I tried the chicken empanada and I enjoyed it's flavor as well as the empanada dough they use.For my entree, I selected the Arugula Salad with skirt steak. The dressing was a bacon fat dressing which went really well with the steak and huge slices of parmesan. For drinks, we each got a mojito and it was very refreshing and made very well! Prices are fair for a place as nice as this.Pro tip: check in on Yelp for a free glass of prosecco! It's delicious!",
      "Thank you so much Carissa! Our empanadas are always the perfect option for sharing. We are so glad to hear that you enjoyed your Sunday lunch with your family and we cannot wait to welcome you back again soon!",
      "I really wanted to like this place because it has a really good vibe, everyone who works there is super nice and they're not over priced, but, the steak was of the quality level of a steak from Denny's. It tasted like it was frozen for a long time, or it was cooked too fast on too high of a temperature because It was super tough/firm and cooked unevenly. Rib eye should melt in your mouth. Mushroom risotto was not great either. Asparagus was great though, and the wine.",
      "El mejor servicio del mundo me encanto la comida, muy buena calidad y excelente servicio Arlett es lo máximo nos hizo sentir como en casa",
      "First upon stepping inside the establishment there was no one there in the front to greet my boyfriend and I. It was around 630-7pm that should be a busy time for dinner. So I would think they would be on their P and Q's for customers arriving at that time. We noticed one large party sitting at a table already. And came out a young waitress from the back with entrees for the table. She asked us what did we need and we said a table for 2. She told us sit anywhere so we picked towards the back where the tv with a fake fire was on the screen. It was a more nice ambience and not so loud next to the big party. Well after sitting there for a good 15 mins maybe that was a mistake because the waitress that told us to sit anywhere never came back to us until my bf got up eventually and asked for help. That already gave us a bad taste in our mouth. While waiting at the table I took the silverware out of the napkins and noticed how dirty they were. Listen I usually can look past water stains from the dishwasher. But I'm talking about sticky residue. All over the fork and knives. So I grab the extra pair next to me to see if that one was better. And same sticky residue! I just thought this was so ridiculous and wanted to let the server know once she gets to us. Well when she did I said something and all she did was grab off another table the silverware. Well guess what. That silverware was filthy as well!! So I'm thinking maybe it's just my luck, I ask to see my bfs silver and same residue. Smh. At this point we already put in orders so I did what I have to do and washed my own silver at the table with our drinking water and napkin. So disappointing. Once she came to our table we put in orders. I asked her if they had any salad choices since it wasn't in the menu. She said they have ceasar salad or garden salad. And I asked if she could put the garden salad as it would be an extra charge since it won't be considered a side to our meat entree, and we said it was fine. Eventually when they food came. I noticed the salad never came. But thought maybe they're just behind. When I asked her about it. She said I didn't mention anything about salads. Oh really so the whole conversation about salads and pricing was make believe. Anyway after that accusation she said well if I still want it it takes two mins to make. But since we ate into our meal already I didn't want it anymore. I just wanted to make sure they didn't bring it out towards the end of our meal if they forgot. Mind you the rest of the night she never came back to check on us. Another lady had came out to ask if we were ok and seemed like everyone else came to ask except her. She had the nastiest attitude and was quite rude when my bf was ordering with her to be honest I wanted to walk out right then and there. We should've because the rest of the night was a disappointment. The food was ok, but the experience left a bad taste in our mouth. There's so many places like this around. And I'm sorry for the pricing with a rude attitude I rather patron another establishment.",
      "Hi Rhonda, please accept our apologies. We are looking into this and have also contacted you via direct message. We value your feedback very much",
      "Graziano's, as I understand it from an outsiders perspective, is an institution. From humble beginnings as a butcher shop (analogous to Keens in NY), they've risen to a multi location powerhouse known for some of the best Argentinian offerings around. Some call it the best steak in Miami, I would say this is a solid entry into that contest given the dinner presentation last night. Our server Jose got us quickly situated with a table far from others (a plus in this environment) water, and bread accompanied by a house made chimichurri. Starters - grilled burrata with tomato, inhouse made chorizo Burrata was fragrant, well flavored and the saltiness that grilling it expressed was balanced perfectly with the tomato soaked in vinaigrette to cut through the richness. Chorizo was well spiced with just enough fat pockets to really the richness of the meat blend. Ratio is always important for a good sausage and they nailed it here. Now onto the meat:Both the bone in rib-eye and the sirloin had a perfect char. Crisp on the outside with a perfect pink cook on the inside. Rested as to not bleed, the kitchen knows what they're doing here. House chimichurri provided again along with a spicier version that was true to what our server described. Salted well, and fat rendered. This is what steak is, people. Salt fat and heat I will give an honorable mention to the mushroom risotto and the fried potato side which i forget the name of. Both are serviceable. 5/5; bottom line, order the damn steaks",
      "Thank you so much Jeffrey for sharing your dining experience with us! We take great pride in our quality food and service, and we're so happy that we could deliver. We're delighted that you enjoyed your experience with our server, in addition to your meal, especially our steaks. We cannot wait to welcome you back again to our locations, see you soon!"

He recommended us to have SAMOSA CHAATBUTTER CHICKENCHICKEN VINDALOO (Hot)CHICKEN SAAGPEPPER GHOST CHEESE NAANSPECIAL MANGO LASSIThe food was soooooo good!!! So flavorful!! Everything we tried was amazing. My sister and I favorite is the chicken vindaloo. We liked the hotness which it wasn't overpowering so we got taste the other seasonings.

      "I was really craving paneer a couple of nights ago. I miss indo-chinese since it's not very prominent down here in Miami and I'm originally from New York. It came in about 45 min although delivery stated. I ordered the chili paneer. I was disappointed that it was so soupy with tons of sauce and tiny pieces of paneer probably about 6-8 very very small pieces for 15.99. I appreciate they gave rice with the order but I rather have a proper portion. It was tasty albeit too liquidy, disappointed because I was still hungry. Won't order again due to small portions.",

      "Came in on a Thursday at 7:30pm and the line took about 30 minutes to get through. The place might not look like it's open from the outside, but it was poppin on the inside. You have your choice of grains, meat, and side with optional additional sides for an extra $1-$2. This carne asada plate came out to $14. This spot also sells a variety of desserts and drinks, but I didn't get any this time. I'm interested in trying their frozen desserts next time.",
      "Great value and variety and flavor.  We came because of the Yelp score, and we are glad we did.  So many good things: 1) attended parking lot (which was needed because it was always full; don't worry: they have a second parking lot across the street when needed),2) snaking line to order (also needed: there were about 20 to 30 people in line when we arrived, the whole time we were there, and when we left. This place is very popular, but they take and fill your order quickly.  I saw people ordering six and 10 meals to go yet the line still moved quickly), 3) video montage shows you the huge variety of menu choices they offer (needed, because I think they expect you to order quickly when you get to the front of the line), 4) amply staffed (they were probably 15 employees working behind the counter, quickly and efficiently, but pleasantly), 5) easy ordering (not all employees spoke English, but because the food is on display behind a glass case, it's easy to just point out what you want in your order), 6) friendly ambience (the man behind me in line, when he heard what I ordered, told me what I should order next time, and insisted I add the fried cheese (queso frito) to my order: he was so right! It doesn't look like much, but it tastes amazing.  Everyone, both customers and employees, seemed happy to be part of such a cool enterprise), 7) quick service (I am confident I got through the line, including payment and receiving my order, within 15 minutes), 8) Great variety (they have the usual choices of steak, chicken and pork, but also tongue and some things I didn't know how to translate the names of from Spanish into English; this is a Nicaraguan restaurant.  I tried it because, since I was visiting Miami, why would I want to eat at a chain restaurant?), 9) authentic flavor (a bit burned on portions of the exterior of my grilled chicken, but it tasted great, as did the rice & peas (aka kidney beans), plaintain (which was perfectly sweet and soft), vinegary sauce (provided on the side without me asking for it), and salad (also provided free, so you don't have to feel guilty for enjoying this guilty pleasure!), and 10) great value (I ordered the grilled chicken (pollo asada) for $10.  It came with two sides; after adding the fried cheese, my total, including tax, was $12.70.  It was enough food for lunch for two, but it tasted good enough for me to eat it all myself, which I did! :-). They had some very tasty looking desserts available, but I didn't try any of them.  The building's exterior and gravel parking lot don't look like much, but don't be put off by that: this place is a find!",
      "If you're still in the neighborhood after a baseball game it's the BEST most delicious option for Latin food by the pound. The line stays long but runs steadily. The staff is friendly when they're not running back and forth. The hustle and bustle of online orders, delivery and pick up station let's you know this place really was worth the amusement park style line to order. We grabbed steak, pork and chicken with their dark seasoned rice and sweet plantains.",
      "Hands down to the best Fritanga in town! The only downfall is the long wait time wether you're calling (lines are usually busy) or you come in person ( usually busy and I've waited in line for over 30 mins multiple times), but the food delicious!",
      "Wow, I had such a fantastic time at this Nicaraguan restaurant in Miami! The atmosphere was so cozy and inviting, I felt like I was dining in someone's home  The staff were all super friendly and made sure we had a great time. And the food, oh my goodness, the food was absolutely delicious! Everything was so fresh and flavorful, it was clear that a lot of care and attention went into preparing each dish  I particularly loved the traditional decor, it really added to the experience. I can't recommend this place enough, if you haven't been yet, you definitely have to check it out!",
      "Fritanga Cana Brava is popular spot in Miami for fritanga/traditional Nicaraguan food in Miami. General comments:Carne Asada / Grilled Steak - better than the cerdoCerdo Asado - get the hot (vinegarly) sauceBoth served with two sides of your choice. Don't get the yucca, it's a bit bland. Rice counts as a sideChicharon - super hard, teeth breaking and pretty salty. It's possibly old or just overdone. There's a reason no one gets thisQueso Frito / Fried Cheese - great, but a bit salty. Also extraChia Con Limon / Chia With Lime - recommendedMaracuya / Passion Fruit - sweet, juice, not specialTamales - not on the menu, but pretty good, very softThey offered to serve us separately from the other line. Not all staff can speak English. The line is long, service is a bit slow. I didn't like how there's no menu or pricing. I'm not sure if I was overcharged since I look different than their normal customers. But all the food pictured for $40.",
      "Sooo goood. I stop in everytime I fly back home to Miami. This place has authentic Nicaraguan food with huge portions. My usual meal is carne asada which includes two sides in which I choose gallo pinto and maduros. Additionally I get the queso frito which of every fritanga I have been to has the freshest queso. Some other places have queso that taste like rubber but NOT here. My favorite Nicaraguan food in Miami. The parking is very minimal and gets busy and hectic along with the line. There is also no menu board. Really enjoy this place!",
      "Delicious food, staff are very attentive, and super nice. Plus it's all at an affordable price.Can totally recommend it and will definitely come back again.",
      "Stopped by here in a Sunday - line was crazy long! Service was slow but good. The food is delicious! Definitely will be back!",
      "I ordered Carne Asada to go and the food arrive still hot. The meat was juicy and tender. It came with 2 big meat. I choose the red beans and rice with sweet plantains. It comes with cole slaw and a vinegar-y sauce. Great flavor, good price, and great portion. It is a must to go here if you are in town!!!"

      "Deelish! Located inside of 1-800 LUCKY,  they definitely filled my dumpling craving. While here I noshed on the soup dumplings. Loved every moment.  Nice size and portions.  You actually get soup with your dumpling LOL!I up charge for a buck and get their chili oil to dip your dumplings in! Unfortunately, I didn't try anything else. I ordered way too much food from the overall hall on this visit. No worries, I'll just need to return!",
      "Highly recommend... just skip the milk tea.. unless you like milk alone. THE PLACE: During my lunch break, I decided to try out YIP inside1800 Lucky. Per usual, parking can be tricky but always possible. I was in and out in under an hour. THE FOOD: Overall, the sampler (4/5) was very good, great presentation and fresh tasting and sure to surpass any cravings! As for the Taro Milk Tea (0/5), this was the biggest disappointment in a very long time. This either needs to be bettered or completely removed from their menu. The \"Taro\" milk tea was like 5% Taro and 95% milk, barely any taro flavor - I essentially had milk with ice.Oh and I also picked Taro (not only because I like Taro) because I was told it was the \"most edible\" of the two milk tea optionsTHE SERVICE:Staff was kind, however seemed misinformed, but perhaps this is also due to management.",
      "The other reviews were right :(I got the Taro Milk Tea because it's super sweet it couldn't possibly be watered down. It was watered down. So while it did taste like Taro, it was not the best. Also a very limited amount of boba. Overpriced as well.",
      "Yummmmy! I wanted to try something new at 1-800 so I stopped at Yip. It was my first time having boba milk tea and I loved it! I also ordered the dim sum sampler and everything tasted delicious.Everything was delicious, service was fast and great. I will be back!",
      "Back in my college youth era there was a cool and hip Chinese restaurant located off Lincoln and Meridian in South Beach called Miss Yip. This place was the bomb with great Cantonese dishes, plus the most delicious dumplings and buns. They closed many years ago and recently I heard of several of food stands opening baring the name Yip and decided to try it while we were in Wynwood. We ordered the Dim Sum platter which comes with spring roll, steamed shrimp, chicken and pork dumplings. I also decided to order the soft crab bao buns, everything was delicious and fresh. I am not sure if Yip is a descendant of the Miss Yip but it's taste gave me nostalgia of my carefree college years.",
      "The dumpling sampler was amazing! What a great opportunity to explore the menu. Every single dumpling was absolutely delicious. Whether it was steamed or fried, regular wonton or green wonton, shrimp or pork, I enjoyed everything about the meal. The two spring rolls were a perfect way to start the meal as well. The mango boba tea was almost like having a dessert.Will be back to explore more of the menu!",
      "It pains me to write this review for Yip because I am ALWAYS thrilled to have dim sum. However, Yip was mediocre at best. We ordered: *Dim Sum Sampler - okay great for the gram but just OK. All the deep fried stuff was pretty good but everything else was just OK. The har gow was SUPER fishy. *Soft Shell Crab Bao - The soft shell crab was super bitter and mushy. I read that as not very fresh. Yikes! *Xiao Long Bao - it was like lukewarm and the inside was mushy so either seemed like low quality ingredients or that it had been frozen for too long. I'll be back to 1-800 Lucky but most likely will not get dimsum again.",
      "A lot of variety and the way you order it and bring it to your own table created a casual eating vibe. The dim sum also varies. Some of them are amazing but some of them are overcooked. I think the flavor in general is good. If you compare it to New York Chinatown dim sum it is no place near it, but for Florida, it is pretty good. I also like the environment, like a fancy food court. If you go with someone don't like dim sum they can also order other food and you guys can eat together. I will go back for the music, ambiance, and casually eating some dim sums.",
      "I've been addicted to this place ever since we had a yelp deal to try the dumpling assortment. I've been addicted to the ones that look like Shumai and have pork and a green layer.. If you know you know. The other dumplings are also delicious and so are the crab buns. My favorite stand at 1-800! Their bubble tea is the TRUTH you have to get the black tea and they have plenty of dairy free milk options. The workers here are always the nicest and the service is quick. Thankfully I live close so sometimes I come here for breakfast and wait until they open I'm addicted. I can't go to wynwood without stopping at YIP.",
      "YIP Wynwood is located in 1-800- lucky-one of my favorite food halls. I've tried most of the food stands- by far YIP keeps me coming back!. My fave dim sum is the Shanghai soup dumpling. In the pictures you can see that I tried the dim sum sampler the green dumpling was shrimp/pork it looks small but it's it's quite big & flavorful, i prefer the steamed ones, I'm not too much into fried food, but they were tasty. When it comes down to beverages their Boba tea is nicely balanced as it's not too sweet, but definitely refreshing for Miami hot weather. 1-800-Lucky has a lot to offer, i do recommend giving the various stands a try!"

      "Hands down my favorite restaurant in Miami. Ambiance is upbeat and intimate. Food is AMAZING does not miss in the year I've been going consistently. Service is outstanding .",
      "Amazing steakhouse Our favorite was the the Australian Wagyu which I can only say was perfection. their sides were so perfectly complimentary. Truffle Mac and cheese, the Brussels sprouts, spinach, broccolini and cauliflower were excellent. Beef lettuce wraps were decent, beet salad was good, kids meals were devoured. ALSO if you're here for breakfast their buffet is great",
      "WOW - To say I was completely blown away by my first time dining here would be an understatement. Whether you're celebrating a special occasion or just craving a delectable meal that will leave you speechless, this is the spot that will be sure to leave a lasting impression. From the lavish and trendy decor, the out of this world dishes, beautiful presentations and impeccable service, every detail was taken well into consideration and perfected.I can say with certainty that this is one of the most gorgeous spaces I've ever eaten a meal in. The sultry vibe, elegantly designed interior, endless display of wine bottles scattered throughout the restaurant and the stunning bar will have you feeling like you're in the midst of dining amongst celebrities. There didn't seem to be a bad table to dine at in sight, but my parents and I were lucky enough to snag one of the beautiful half-moon booths toward the center of the room. When is the last time you've been to a restaurant that brings complimentary French fries to the table? And not just any regular ole' French fries, but a delicious trio of French fries each complimented by their own unique dipping sauce? Bet it's probably never happened before, unless you've eaten here. I thought this was such a neat but simple touch that really set them apart from other high-end restaurants. They also bring yummy rolls topped with sea salt to the table (between the fries & the bread, you might end up in a food coma before you even order if you're not careful). I ordered the tuna tartar for an appetizer and I was in heaven every time I took a bite. Not only does it melt in your mouth, but the presentation alone is enough reason to order this (the way they mix it for you makes for a fun video opportunity if you have your phone ready to record). My parents shared a shrimp cocktail that they both enjoyed - The shrimp were massive! Following the appetizers, I munched on a cesar salad which was perfectly dressed. Now... the STEAK. Holy moly, one of the best filet mignons I have had yet. It was ridiculously flavorful, tender & juicy. Melted in your mouth and bursted with flavor. If you're a steak lover, it would be a crime to come here and not order it. The mashed potatoes that accompanied it were also flavorful, but I thought they were a little too runny (my only complaint of the whole meal). If you're a fan of grilled onions, do yourself a favor and order a side of these to top your steak with and thank me later. The \"Smoked Chocolate S'mores\" dessert was ridiculously decadent and was the perfect finish to an impeccable meal. Yes, it's insanely pricy and yes, it's totally worth it. My experience here was one of the best dining experiences I've ever had in Miami - And that says a lot given the fact that Miami is one of the hottest spots in the country for foodies. This restaurant hit it out the park for me and I'm already searching for an excuse to go back to South Florida and to savor new dishes on their menu.",
      "The restaurant is spacious and nice. Bar is nice as well.Staff was friendly and attentive.For appetizers the tuna tartare was fresh and seasoned well.They also bring you French fries 3 different ways with 3 different sauces. I had the certified Angus rib cap cooked medium rare and It was good and flavorful. The side of Mac and Cheese was good as well.",
      "Our favorite was the the Australian Wagyu which I can only say was perfection.",
      "Ambiance was awesome. The dishes, coctails and the dessert were so delicious. All the employees were so polite and friendly. They celebrated our honeymoon with a cute card, it was so nice.They made our special day unforgettable.",
      "Wonderful experience! Fabulous service. Timing, everything was a 10.  Our server really made our night fabulous, she was awesome. Great steak, Mac and cheese with truffle was really nice. Molten cake was super good as well. I must say everything was impeccable.",
      "Phenomenal cuisine. Never have a enjoyed such a succulent and flavourful sea bass - it is one of their renowned specials. But the lack of bones in the fish was made up for by the pained bones in my rear.The decor was beautiful but very far from comfortable. The low chairs were too uncomfortable for eating. The benches; built for slaves.The overall experience was truly hampered by a god awful designer deserving of life in prison for her domestic terror on comfort. 4/5 not bad",
      "This plus is amazing! We had a private room & our server was Erin. Erin was very pleasant, patient, informative & very professional. She suggested several appetizers & dinner. It was our first time visiting this restaurant & it definitely won't be our last.",
      "Food was incredible. I love that when you get to the table instead of getting some bread you get french fries. Service was also impeccable and ambiance is very family friendly in my opinion"

Incredible. - Tiramisu OMG - get it. - Tableside Caesar - Very nice server - Ben - Foccacia bread The good: - Meatball App - The wine cellar and steak presentation as you walk in is a nice touch General feedback: - Dimming the lights a bit more would give it some real ambiance and a homier feel  - They JUST opened so cut the staff some slack. I've been on a team opening a restaurant before and it's so hard. They did great! - Good location - easy access with ample parking. A local steakhouse is just what the neighborhood needs - The staff was really sweet and everyone was really working hard all night.",
      "Went here for a birthday dinner. They have a great menu with all sorts of selections.  Our waiter was pushy and rude.  We ordered a NY Strip, Branzino, Pasta Bolonaize, Filet Minan, truffle fries and salad.  The steaks were ordered medium well done.  All the food was good except the steaks.  They kept bringing back the steaks rare and the waiter was angry with nasty comments toward us.  If you go here avoid this guy.  We told the mgr who seemed surprised.",

      "Hello my name is Nick. Of course I'm from New York. I usually don't write reviews specially bad ones we got to this nice restaurant very gorgeous inside. The bread was delicious. I have to say the first course was a pasta dish we split. It had a Bolognese sauce on it it was served hot and good. Little did I know that was the highlight of a dinner. My steak came out first they cut it up which I wasn't crazy about but it was cold. my friends ordered a veal dish a special order. They accommodated them but the dish also was ice cold. The dish presentation was very nice but it being cold was definitely a problem. I must mention the sides to twice cook baked potato was a baked potato not twice cooked. The cream spinach was nice fresh baby spinach sautéed with melted cheese on top. The menu, said cream of spinach. I do wish they would get their act together, and I would even consider trying it again. The Decour is very elegant. It was Christmas Eve. We got there at 6:15 and it wasn't that busy. There was no excuse for the cold food. I must say I was very disappointed. My name is nick hogan.",

If you don't right you can catch the live music as the sun sets, and the restaurant transforms to a lounge. Totally worth coming Parking is tricky, and if you're not paying attention you might miss it as you drive by. But it's a gem worth coming back to.",
      "Seaspice is known to Miami locals as a very high end resturant, frequented by celebrities.  I have no idea why.  The service is pretty awful.  The drink runners are horrible.  It takes about 30 minutes for just a drink to be brought out to you.  The food is mediocre.  It is definitely NOT worth the price, which is very expensive.  I am giving two stars because the view is amazing.  Seaspice is right on the water and has a gorgeous ambiance.  You can watch yachts drive by and some will even pull up and park.  The other star is for the tres leches.  This dessert was AMAZING, I would go back just to eat it again.  But otherwise, Seaspice is nothing special.  Save your money.",
      "A place that tries to be high end but fails to deliver.Service ? Mediocre Food ? Below parFirst thing when you check in is they tell you that you have a 2 hr max(tacky)",
      "I read this was one of the best patio dining AND a hot spot for celebrities in Miami, so I had to go check it out on our recent travels to this area...Initially I was worried about our luggage situation, as we had to carry our luggage to the restaurant since this was our last stop in Miami. However, they were very accommodating, and let us store some of our stuff in the closet, and we kept the big luggage with us, near our table.As expected, the patio scene was spectacular...city skyline and seaside views, with plenty of yachts passing by! The place indeed had that chic celebrity vibe...truly FAB! Loved the music overhead as well. Somehow, I expected some snobbiness...but not at all. Service was great!Then the food. OMFG...I've had some amazing foods lately, but this takes the cake. Even the complimentary bread was amazing (and unique)! My husband ordered this Wagyu Burger, and I chose this Ragu Pappardelle ( THE best Ragu Pappardelle I've ever had...EVER. ). Then this Pavola dessert...again, just beyond delish. Truly, this was foods for the celebrities.Honestly, I'm shocked at how low the rating is for this place. I assume that if the service isn't top notch, it would probably piss some folks off. The pricing was on the outlandish side...with even lunch entrees starting at around 40. There was even an appetizer item priced at around 70 bucks! Luckily, like I said, I felt that the foods and the service (and especially the spectacular ambiance) made up for it. There was this big yacht parked right near us, which somewhat blocked some of the views from the left. Still, we got our eyeful of seaside/yachtside views.In any case, this was a great way to end our trip in Miami.",
      "Went here with a group of girlfriends for brunch and everything was delicious, they were super accommodating as well.I had the froze , a cucumber and gin cocktail and 2 grey goose and sodas and all were fantastic.As a table we split the fresh fish and a couple sides and it was delicious. Also love the free bread It is definitely on the pricier side overall tbh but great for a fun \"fancy\" brunch",
      "Came here for Miami spice and although we spent more than we thought we would, we had a good time. Everything was delicious. The kale Caesar had pecans and Granny Smith apple slices, never had a Caesar like this but it was a nice change! The Shrimp Pesto Whole Wheat Spaghetti was my favorite, even though I'm not the biggest fan of pesto. The burger was good too just a little messy from the truffle aioli. The chocolate cremoso and tres leches was very good but I'd go with the cremoso for the cocoa nib crumble, yum! All in all, I think it's overpriced and I probably won't come here again because of that. The cheapest bottle of Chardonnay was $75 and most drinks were $20. I only came here for Miami spice and still spent almost $200.",
      "Given we still have Miami Spice going on until the end of the month we decided to try out the lunch menu @ Seaspice gorgeous location on the Miami River, sitting outdoor is really relaxing, so beautiful to watch the boats go by, really lovely To start we had the Comte' Cheese Soufflé, I have to admit this was a bit disappointing, it really did not have the texture of a real soufflé  but then............ the Shrimp Pesto Whole Wheat Spaghetti and the Pan-Seared Chilean Seabass were really good as dessert, both the Tres Leches and the Chocolate Cremoso were yummy Try it out before Miami Spice ends, you can check out the Miami Spice Menus on miamiandthebeaches.com@seaspicemia",
      "First time for me at Seaspice, it is located on the banks of the Miami River it is a gem that you should not miss. Sit outside in the courtyard enjoy your food and a drinks while watching the boats go by, just beautiful We had the Miami Spice lunch which has a very affordable fix price 3 course menu for $ 28, unfortunately this will end soon, nevertheless, I would defiantly go back again for sureRegarding the Miami Spice menu only one observation, they should have had more than one choice for the Entrees without the extra charge, right now you have 4 choices and 3 of these have extra charge on it, not really fair given that you are promoting the Spice menu, you should have at least two or three choices included in the price and one or two with the extra charge We had had Prince Edward Island Mussels, Grilled, the Grilled Faroe Island Salmon and the Profiteroles and Peaches and Cream. My favorite where the Mussels, the garlic pizza bread they brought for the table was absolutely delicious, the Salmon was good too. I had the Peaches for dessert and it was ok, not really my thing, my friend said the Profiteroles were great, next time I will not opt for the healthy dessert We enjoyed all with a good Albariño wine, our experience was made especially enjoyable by our waiter Fabrizio, he was really great ! Thank you Fabrizio @seaspicemia",
      "Bad first impression. Its not a nice feeling to feel like you have to beg to spend your money at a restaurant. Every year I look forward to Miami Spice. It's a great way to try out various restaurants and a unique spread of menu options. Seaspice was on my radar and happened to be one of the participating restaurants offering the Miami Spice menu. I contacted the restaurant in advance and made a reservation for 3:30p for a party of four. My mom who is from out of town was excited to join us for lunch. I advised the restaurant we were doing the Miami Spice menu. The restaurant made it clear that they charge $50pp for No Shows. At 3:15pm, we arrived for our reservation. The hostess Karin greeted us, and advised us that they were running behind on the reservations and because of this they will not be able to offer the Miami Spice menu. Only the a la-carte menu will be offered. This was a bit upsetting because we drove almost an hour to get there and the restaurant is refusing to offer the Miami Spice promotion. Our natural instinct was to just say forget it we will go somewhere else. I mean, at the end of the day who wants to beg to spend their money? It's absurd. If the restaurant is offering a promotional menu and because to no fault of our own they are running behind why should we be penalized?My Mom looked so bummed out. Because she was so excited to try this place. I decided to walk back in and ask for a Manager. The Manager took 20min to come out. When he finally did come over, he introduced himself as Collin. I explained to him what was going on and it seemed as though he wasn't aware that the hostesses were turning Miami Spice customers away. He decided to make it right and advised Karin to honor the Miami Spice menu. Impressive! Things were turning around. Besides the encounter at the hostess stand, the restaurant is beautiful. It is situated on Miami's waterfront were you can view the million dollar yachts passing by. They also have docks for those interested in docking and dining. You can view the downtown city skyline which I am sure looks amazing at night.The food was excellent. The Miami Spice menu offered a three course lunch for $28. You have the choice of a starter (Kale Salad, Cheese Souffle, or White Gazpacho). A choice of entrees (Seabass, Chicken Breast, Shrimp Pesto Pasta, Wagyu Burger, or Plant Bowl). And a choice of dessert (Tres Leches or Chocolate Cremoso). They also offer the option to add a Glass of wine for and additional $12. I ordered the Comte Cheese Souffle, the Green Circle Farms Chicken Breast, and the Tres Leches. The others in my party ordered the Kale Salad, Gazpacho, and Seabass. For starters, My favorites were the Kale Caesar Salad and Cheese Souffle. The Kale Caesar had a mix of shredded Granny Smith apples, pecans and a creamy Caesar dressing. The cheese Souffle was like a fluffy egg Souffle with a cream parmesan sauce and tomato chutney. Delicious!For entrees, both the Seabass and Chicken breast were amazing. The Chicken breast was tender and juicy, served on top of a creamy polenta and topped with corn, peas, and mushrooms. The seabass was seared nicely to give a nice crunch on the outside, while perfectly flaky and moist on the inside. It was served with stewed garbanzo, Swiss chard, and smoked potato. For desserts, we all had Tres Leches. It was served in a small Mason jar topped with 3 milks, and berries. Perfect way to end the meal. The portions are not large but it is filling. The flavors are fresh and very well balanced. The food presentation was notable. The Watermelon Tequila drink was delightful and refreshing. The froze was also a big hit. The cocktails were presented well and created perfectly. We enjoyed everything. Our waiter, Austin was very friendly. He made great recommendations and was very attentive.An 18% gratuity was added to the tab. There are lots of street parking accessible. In the end, the food was great. Ambience was amazing. The hostesses can use additional customer service training and learn to use better judgment to improve the customers experience. There was no need to escalate the matters to a manager. It could have been handled properly by showing empathy, apologizing, and finding a solution to the problem.",
      "Hi Kim,Thank you for dining with us and leaving a detailed review. It has been forwarded to our management team. Our apologies for the confusion at the door.  Glad to hear Collin accommodated you and your experience was turned around.  We are happy to see your great feedback regarding the food, cocktails, and Austin’s Service.  Hopefully you will join us again in the near future!",
      "This is my second time going to sea spice & I normally love it as the first time. I never leave bad reviews But this second time MY PHONE WAS STOLEN AND SECURITIES DID NOThing about it. Instead we're trying to blame me for the situation. I'm not drunk nor was drunk. I walked in with 2 phone and walked out with 1.We came as my friend USUALLY does and this is how they treated us  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME. I thought it was 5 star so nothing could go wrong. With a security right next to our table my phone STILLL got stolen. It was on the table. And to whoever has the time to steal phones is just sad imagine what else they can steal... I wil ask to review cameras but with the way I was treated when I let them know I lost my phone I doubt they will be helpful but I'll let every platform form of review know that they steal phones here. I know the exact time frame as well so they wouldn't even have to look much at the cameras. Let's see. BTW I BEEN HOME SICK AFTER EATING THESE OYSTERS I COULDNT Even celebrate my baby's birthday w him.",
      "Came here for my birthday dinner with my boyfriend for a 7:15 reservation (we called in advance for an outdoor seat dock side) we waited about ten minutes after our arrival for our table to be ready at the bar, the short wait was definitely worth it. Started with an aperol spritz at the bar then ordered octopus and gazpacho to start. Octopus portion was good but the olive oil tasted burnt since it came out on a sizzling hot cast iron looking skillet (its very easy to overcook octopus, please just bring a regular plate next time.) I also had the whole main lobster. Extremely delicious large portion of perfectly cooked and seasoned lobster, bravo. My boyfriend had the truffle coated Chilean sea bass and he absolutely loved it. Vibe: 5/5 this place definitely is a scene but not overwhelmingly pretentious or obnoxious. Absolutely loved the music as well. Service:3/5 A bit slow, our server was very attentive when we were able to get his attention but we had to always wave him down. Food: 4/5 everything was honestly pretty good (octopus could've had a bit more attention to detail)",
      "Hi Liz,Thank you for celebrating your birthday with us!  We are so happy to hear you had a great experience and enjoyed the food.  Your feedback regarding the octopus has been sent to our chef. We look forward to seeing you again soon!"

      "My brother and I visited the restaurant for Miami Spice. We got lucky and found parking in the street and made our reservation for 11:30am.I requested to sit outside because it was a nice vibe. We both ordered the Miami Spice menu, a drink and coffee. The food was excellent, the service was friendly and the vibe was chill with music from the pool.",
      "on the third floor of the goodtime hotel.very overpriced place for small portion food but amazing decor and staff service. Its so pretty and cute with the theme of strawberry, amazing bathroom, random nice living room. And very very very nice aesthetic atmosphere. The babaganoush was very good i would say that, i wanted a salad but looking at the price i rather eat shared plates. I didnt get too full on this meal but the pizza was just ok, it was really all very small.",
      "Service is terrible there but the food is good and the interior is nice. I usually go there for a brunch. Most of the tables are in the shadow which is very important in Miami. But again, the service is bad. Very slow and it's hard to find a waiter, they are always disappearing. Last time they brought me a greek salad forgetting about my allergy to bell peppers. I asked them to redo it. They just removed it so when I came home I had to take allergy pills because I felt terrible.",
      "I came across Strawberry Moon on Yelp when I was looking for somewhere to go for dinner around the area I would be in. I had seen on social media that this new hotel had opened this summer so I was excited to go check out Goodtime Hotel while having a nice meal.Strawberry Moon was a little hidden in terms of trying to find the hotel and then getting to the restaurant itself. There's lots of ads around the windows of the first floor of the hotel indicating Strawberry Moon so my guest and I were a little confused trying to open doors. We went in the lobby of the hotel and was told to go up to the 5th floor. We then arrived and wow, what a beautiful hotel! Definitely a chic spot with pink and greens.We arrived early and explored a bit. The restaurant ended up being able to seat us early. We made it just in time as it was the last day of Miami Spice so we were able to sample a 3 course menu from them at a cheaper rate.We each ordered different items to try a little of everything! We also had some wine and a cocktail. The Strawberry Moon cocktail I ordered was extremely strong. I was not expecting that. We had tried The Godfather and the tuna / salmon raw appetizer. Both really good! The Godfather is just like a pepperoni pizza. We also tried an impossible dish and the roasted chicken. They were both flavorful and a hit. I was recommended the roasted chicken by the server as that was one of the restaurant's most popular dishes. I thought the portion was a great size as I still had a bit leftover. We did finish the night with cheesecake and another dessert they had. Both had us really happy that we came here for dinner even though it wasn't too price conscious. We were here on a Friday night and just when we were about to leave, the DJ was setting up. It looks like they have a DJ on the weekends at night. Service was decent but we couldn't find out server for the majority of the night. By the time we asked someone else for him to bring us the check, we gave him our credit cards. He ended up removing the original receipt and just giving us the credit card slips to sign. To tip was an option on these receipts. The total looked off to me so I asked to see the original receipt. The original receipt included a service charge of 20% so I made sure to tell my friend. The server wouldn't have told us and nothing on our slips indicated that we would be leaving an additional gratuity. It was a bit sneaky from our end. End of the night, we had a rideshare to come pick one of us up. The rideshare ended up being on the other side of the hotel to pick us up so just watch out for that. As they have a major street on Washington and then an alley for cars / valet.",
      "Visited Strawberry Moon for the first time to celebrate a friends birthday and we had a good time. It's a pretty swanky restaurant/ bar located in the Goodtime Hotel in SoBe. The place was sort of empty considering it was a Friday night during Happy hour but I truly had no complaints as I try to avoid crowded areas now a days. We just stayed to enjoy their happy hour menu which isn't too large but included plenty of cocktails with tequila and small bites.",
      "I came here for my birthday and it was a beautiful restaurant with amazing service. I love how perfectly d the room was and the food options were amazing. The octopus salad was delicious and I forgot the name of my drink but it was refreshing and sooooo good. That first sip was amazing. They also gave me a birthday shot  totally unexpected. The restaurant was located in such a beautiful hotel and there was a lot to see especially the pink library.",
      "Hmmm honestly I really don't know what the hype is. Maybe it's different during the day from what I heard but when we had our dinner at night it was \"ok\". There was really nothing special about it to be frank. Lighting was ok, food was ok and a little overpriced for what it was. I honestly didn't see what the hype was all about. Maybe I need to come back during the day to see if there's a difference. Overall it was just \"blah\" meaning ok to me. I mean would I go back....probably not but who knows. Sadly I wasn't impressed",
      "Trendy restaurant on the 3rd floor of the goodtime hotel. The have a great heated pool deck",
      "Strawberry Moon has hands down quickly become a favorite restaurant of mine in Miami that holds a special place in my heart. Why? Well, I spent this year's Birthday Celebration in Miami and got to enjoy partaking of Strawberry Moon's wonderful food and cocktails while staying at The Goodtime Hotel during this trip. Strawberry Moon is the top highlight to staying at The Goodtime Hotel (w/ the exception of relaxing by poolside- the pool is great). Side Note- One of the things that made poolside so spectacular was hanging out there while devouring the Plant-Based Chicken Shawarma w/ French Fries dish ($18) that we ordered via Strawberry Moon by Poolside. It was So Good!!! Strawberry Moon is on the 3rd Floor of the hotel. You can make a reservation, let the hostess.know that you want to go inside of the restaurant or just walk-in, especially as we were able to do that because it was quiet w/ a few patrons there during the happy hour. Strawberry Moon has both Indoor and Outdoor Dining. We enjoyed both during our stay. Both have vibrant, beautiful, bold colorful decor including the walls, artwork, chair & table settings ,cool lighting fixtures, etc. The Outdoor area is breathtaking to view w/ gorgeous lighting at night. Strawberry Moon has dope music they play duirng the dinner service which included 80's / 90's Hip-Hop, R&B, etc. We thoroughly enjoyed Strawberry Moon's Happy Hour two of the three days we stayed at the hotel. We had the following during Happy Hour : IL Capitano Cocktai ($8)l- Brugal Rum, Malibu Rum, Pineapple, Cranberry, Orange, Raspberry.Purple Reign Cocktail ($8) - Avion Silver, Tequila, domaine dc canton, shahu, butterfly pea lavender,  yuzuSpicy Jaja Margarita ($8) - Jaja Tequila, dos hombres Mezcal, Mango, Lime, habanero.Godfather Pizza ($8) - Flatbread Shaped Pepperoni PieHummus w/ Pita Bread - ($8) Ashley makes fabulous cocktails. They were well-mixed, well-prepared and tasted so smooth and were refreshing. Both the Pizza and Hummus w/ Pita Bread were marvelous. Everything was DELICIOUS!Ashley, Reggie and the rest of the Extraordinary, fantastic, lovely, hardworking, professional, dedicated, friendly, warm-hearted, courteous, gracious Strawberry Moon staff are one of a kind. Strawberry Moon also helped me ring in my Birthday w/ special Birthday Dessert.  If you are in Miami and are looking for a good place to eat and have drinks, consider Strawberry Moon. This place is a definite Gem. Oh and I forgot to add that we enjoyed some Strawberry Moon Cocktails while singing during their Karaoke Night which is on Tuesdays. We performed.Beyonce \"Break My Soul\" and of course Doja Cat \"Nedd To Know\". Fun Times!Hours of Operation- Monday- Thursday - Noon - 10pmFriday & Saturday -11am - 11pmHappy Hour is 4pm-7pm (Excellent Happy Hour!)Lunch - Noon -4pm / Dinner - 6pm-10pmWebsite- strawberrymoonmiami.comInstagram- @strawberrymoon"

      "It was not the best among the chain. They use way too much sauce on their beef sushi. So much that the rice falls apart. Don't need to overwhelm the taste buds when the meat and presentation is super quality. Maybe a ponzu based sauce would be better with any kind of beef sushi. Our server was great and very attentive and responded anytime we called him. I was a bit shocked that they brought out all the meat at the same time. Would be better if they send out unmarinated items first and then switch out the grill and go with the marinated. Still a very good experience. Highly recommended!",
      "We had a delicious meal here. Our server was very friendly and efficient. I liked the salad and the shrimp appetizer especially. The miso soup was a bit bland. The steak with rice appetizer was OK. I wish Inremembered even half the names of the meats but they are not typical names. I loved all of the meats except for the fatty one. It resembles bacon but it was too fatty for me so we switched it out for shrimp. The shrimp was excellent. You cook your meal and it is fun. You can cook it exactly to your liking so that is great. My Margarita was pretty tasty. I really enjoyed the smore's dessert and wish there was more of it. This is a unique place to eat in Brickell or really anywhere. I highly recommend it.",
      "Love this place with a passion. Every time we're in Miami we come here because of how much we love it. Coming from SoCal this has been one of our favorite restaurants. The service here is great. Our waiter Jorge was super friendly, attentive, and such a help. We hope to have him every time we come. We love the all you can eat option. Prices have def increased since two years ago though. Use to be about half the price which is a shame. One of my favorite items here is the tuna crispy rice , soooo amazing. The toro and short rib are also our favorites. We cannot wait to come back again.",
      "I really loved this place back when I first discovered it in 2017, but slowly over time. I've started to lose my excitement for this establishment. The concept is a great idea, but at the end of the day, I believe there are more affordable and accessible Korean BBQ places in South Florida. I went here for New Year's Eve during lunchtime with my family. Don't get me wrong, the food was delicious, but I can't help but feel the price pushing it. Our waiter was apathetic and didn't check in on us or refill our drinks. He came over once, ordered, and we didn't see him again until the bill arrived. It felt rushed at times, and we were still hungry by the end, but you don't get endless restocks on the meat. At the end of the day, I'll not rush back here to eat Korean BBQ.",
      "Really enjoy this place. Make sure you make reservations as sometimes they get full.Staff has been friendly and attentive.I enjoyed the spring rolls, garlic noodles and Kimchi for appetizers.I like the approach of ordering different meats to cook so you can taste it.Personally, the Kalbi is my favorite. Thin sliced and very flavorful. The waiter will tell you how long to cook each meat.The skirt steak isn't bad either. Tasted others and nothing bad so far.If you have room for dessert you can get smores. Brings 2 for each order.",
      "Cool concept for a cook it yourself restaurant. Can make RSVP or just pop in or make reservations. The premium meats were excellent and so was the fried rice. Extensive menu with a great variety of meats to select.",
      "Talk about yummy! I love being able to sit around a table and share making a good meal with my family. We ordered so many different items. Veggies, chicken, shrimp, multiple beef cuts, mushrooms to make in the grill. Everything was so good. We got the fried rice which was so good, comes in a hot pot! Get the app and you can get discounts, I got 10 dollars off my meal.",
      "Food is great you get the experience of cooking for yourself on the table, service was a bit slow but it was really full the night I went !! Can't forget to mention that the mojitos were super tasty  Ambiance was nice .",
      "Great place, great atmosphere, amazing staff will definitely suggest this place all my friends!",
      "I'm not a Korean BBQ fan but this place is great!My personal faves:Spicy shrimp 10/10Beef Sukiyaki Bibimbap 10/10Smores 10/10Service is overall good, the place gets really busy so expect a bit of a wait. Will definitely be back!!"

      "Had a fantastic time to celebrating my buddy's birthday at Esotico recently. From the decor, to the service and the overall vibe Esotico is a unique and fun location to visit. There are many exotic cocktails as well as a solid menu - in particular I'd call out the lamb burger (80/20 mix of lamb and wagyu beef) as a must. Others enjoyed the pineapple fried rice and wontons very much. Our serve Lorenzo was very helpful as we navigated the drink menu and had questions about the mugs, locale, etc. Looking forward to our next excuse to visit Esotico.",

I had calamari...was a little fishy Spring rolls...good Guac...good Drinks..decentI did the steak and asked for medium.... let's just say the chef cooked the cow twice. How do you burn and dry steak out? I didn't send it back... didn't want to be a bother. They missed the mark. I was underwhelmed. Cutesy place...but it stops there.",

Everyone ordered at least one drink and we all loved it. Some drinks you have the option to take home the souvenir cups. Loved the drinks - too bad we didn't order one of their more special one that includes a mini show. Their drinks reminds me of Trader Sam's in downtown Disney. We also ordered some food, my best friend and I got the pineapple fried rice and loved it. Overall, great spot to hangout. I'd come back here to try more drinks and food!",

I was really intrigued by the octopus hot dog but I ended up going with the Lamborghini burger and a cocktail. I can't remember which cocktail but it was good. I've never had lamb before especially on a burger, so this is a First and it was actually really good. I liked that It was paired with the goat cheese, and the flavor combination was new for me.  The fries are really nice and crispy and we really enjoyed our experience overall. We were seated outside, so I can't really speak to hell the restaurant looks inside, but our area was really nicely lit and it was a really chill night.  there were a few other parties there and they are dog friendly!",

      "Esotico will always have a special place in my heart because my boyfriend & I had our first date here! They have one of the best food & drink happy hour's in Miami and the service is always amazing! During Happy Hour the drinks are $10 & you honestly you can't go wrong with ordering any of the drinks because they are all so good! If I had to choose 2 favorites they would be the El Tikilero & Sexy Colada! Bites are also $10 during Happy Hour, they change up the menu so they usually have different things but everything I've tried is super yummy. I always order the chips & guacamole even when it's not on the happy hour menu! Last time we went I ordered the Ahi Tuna Poke Bowl on happy hour & it was so much food for $10 it was so worth it! Highly recommend for groups & even date night the happy hour usually isn't super packed so it's nice that you're able to sit, talk & enjoy fantastic tiki drinks!",

He seemed very attuned to the person taking on night shift as a bartender and not very interested in his one customer.  Message received.  I am staying in the building where your restaurant is located.  You had a captive audience.  I did enjoy the fun interior, not the service or drinks. For as expensive as it turned out to be with the built in tip, not worth it. Feel like the service was lacking and lazy for an auto tip.   meh.",

      "The food is always to die for here!  I always come when it's slightly cold.. I always order the DanDan noodles or the soul ramen ! It always hits the spot..Tonight my friend and I waited outside for like 15 minutes (when it was like 50 degrees outside). they did not have a wait list and the waiter was trying to remember people in order (which was ok but it could be more organized ).Ambiance of the place is always intimate. Every one of the wait staff is so nice. I'm grateful for Marcus (who's always giving great hospitality!) and his warm welcome. The cooks like they are always busy ! But I can say, from walking in to ordering our food, it came in like 8 min max! It was sooo fast ! We were so happy! I will always be a return customer",
      "If I'm being honest, service was 3 but the food tasted too good for me to give this place anything but 5.I'll get straight to it, my Ichimi ramen was amazing. Very flavorful thick broth, awesome house made noodles, just the right amount of greens. But just 3 very thin pork slices... It was disappointing. I'd order it again, it was that good, but non-existent amount of (delicious!) meat was almost insulting. Get extra meat when you order!We came on a Tuesday night and it wasn't particularly busy, that said our server was very brief and didn't even introduce herself. A little smile could go a long way. The vibe of the place is quite enjoyable though. But again, the ramen was just too good to rate this place anything but 5!",
      "Nice restaurant!The ambiance is classy and quiet, which I love. The service was wonderful from the guy, but pretty mean from the female server.The food overall was okay-ish! I was expecting pretty high standards for the amazing atmosphere and high ratings, but there were some key ingredients that were missing in the broth. Maybe it's because I've had real ramen in Asia so I was comparing too much, but at least the presentation was great!",
      "Amazing spot for a quick bite. The service is extremely fast to get seated and also to get your food. They have great ramen and rice dishes for a variety of diets which I love. Lately I've had the veggie one but in the past I've tried their signature pork base which is delightful. I would definitely recommend this place for a quick dinner.",
      "Pros: Outstanding service. The shrimp bao bun was packed with veggies and a huge shrimp, so delicious. The vegetable ramen was sooooo good! I can't wait to go back!Cons: the GPS sent me to another location, so I had a hard time finding it, but I'm glad I didn't give up!",
      "The location  of this restaurant is great. Parking was easy to find since we came early in the evening on a Thursday night. I can't begin to stop thanking whoever was in charge of the music because it set a great ambiance. I had the chicken gyoza and wasn't disappointed at all. Wish I could take a whole box of frozen ones home just to have. The texture of it was spot on so not soggy! Crispy but soft  & just the right amount of meat inside. Due to an amazing staff. The ramen came out fast and ready to eat. The broth wasn't too hot. If you're dying of hunger I would suggest that you just get a bowl of ramen, I couldn't finish mine. There was so much to enjoy, I added shrimp and wonton to my already-filled bowl of different toppings. Do not skip the eggs. Bon appetite!",
      "To my surprise the shrimp bao to start was very light and crispy despite the frying. Full of flavor from the pickled veggies and sauce. The spicy miso ramen that I optioned with Shrimp was a flavor explosion. Thick broth just brimming with that satisfying umami flavor and great texture. The eggs were also cooked to perfection with runny yolks. Very satisfying and hit the spot. This is a must for Ramen lovers.",
      "Ordered food from here during our stay in Miami. We used Uber eats to order and our food was delivered hot and ready. We had everything we needed to enjoy this wonderful meal. I ordered the ichimi pork ramen for myself and the chicken fried rice for hubby. Portions were nice and the food was very good. We thoroughly enjoyed it and would love to eat/order food here again.",
      "Ichimi was disappointing. My threshold for good Asian food in Miami is low, but the food here was still disappointing nonetheless. I got the lunch special with spicy miso ramen, pork gyoza, and crab salad. The pork gyoza was sweet and more on the soggy than crispy side. The spicy miso ramen was where it was most disappointing. It looks good, but the broth is not spicy and not very flavourful. I would keep taking sips of the broth expecting another flavour profile, only to be let down again. I'm glad other reviewers liked Ichimi though, it's just not for me.",
      "I was in a soup mood and this was the closest place serving soup. Service was very fast and our food came out quickly. We got the Ichimi ramen which was pretty good. However it wasn't hot enough and some of the ingredients were still room temperature since the broth wasn't hot."

I had to constantly ask for another mimosa and wait about 15 min to get each one sometimes even longer. Sometimes I had to even ask servers who weren't even my own waiter. If I am paying that much for bottomless mimosas I shouldn't have to chase down my waiter for my next mimosa. And to add to that the check already includes 20% tip so if the tip is included as well the service should match. Just a little disappointed cause I was really excited to try this place.

      "Order the Benedict.  Came out with overcooked eggs, server grabbed the plate to redo.  Second plate comes out - same.  Hard boiled eggs!  They take it back to the kitchen and try again.  They come back with a to go box?!? I said oh, are we getting kicked out?  The waitress didn't know what to say.  I pulled the food out  of the bag, no potatoes, no hollandaise.  I asked her what was going on.  She was going to have the kitchen make it again.  I said, it's been an hour and half, I need to go.  So embarrassing for this place.  It \"looked\" good.  Fortunately there's a Starbucks next door so I grabbed and breakfast sandwich and off to work.  I wouldn't recommend this place.",
      "Overall good brunch. We got a croissant with eggs Benedict which was really well made. The crepe was fresh and not too heavy. Service was quick and kind. They do charge an automatic 20% tip on top of their Miami (expensive) brunch prices. But the food is good and they have a simple, straighforward menu with good options and good flavor.",
      "Fantastic little spot. It is quite small but well arranged and it doesn't feel crowded at all. Even though it was quite busy and most people sat inside due to the rain, I was able to enjoy my meal. The staff was super friendly and the service was fast. I love their decor and music. The whole experience was divine. The menu is extensive and has options pretty much for everyone. Their beverage menu is rather small but can't never go wrong with coffee, right? Now I am used to my latte's foam having a little piece of art but my latte here was just boring foam lol the latte was pretty good though and I love that they had alternatives to lactose. The eggs Benedict with ham was so fulfilling. Perfect portions and the egg was perfectly runny.I totally recommend this place if you visit Miami. No parking readily available that I saw though. I took an Uber, but there is little street parking if you get lucky you may find a place within the block.",
      "Visited while in Miami for weekend brunch. The restaurant was busy and has a very cute ambiance. I had an excellent server who was kind and attentive. I had the bottomless mimosas and the breakfast crepe which was delicious. I would recommend Cafe Bastille and look forward to visiting again.",
      "This is a cute breakfast/lunch spot in downtown Miami. I will say it's pretty small but we got there later in the day so there wasn't a wait time for us. The Dj wasnt bad but it wasn't the lit brunch i thought it would be..kind of misleading on social media in terms of the vibes.I had the burger and shared the French toast bites with my table. Everything was pretty yummy and standard for breakfast items. I absolutely loved their truffle fries. I would return again! My only biggest con was the location of the bathroom.. being that the place is so small they probably can't help it. But I had on heels and almost broke my legs trying to maneuver past the kitchen/storage area. It was a super busy  with kitchen staff and a tight space with wet floors. The people were pretty helpful but I almost fell twice .",
      "I've been coming here for over 10 years and it's always been one of my favorites. I haven't been in quite some time but the eggs Benedict is still the best in miami. They are very busy now (well-deserved) and I am happy to see that they will be expanding on the same block. That is wonderful! I would love them to open a location in Edgewater or midtown closer to where I live now. I would invest!! I truly love this place from way back when and am very happy for their booming success. The staff is wonderful! The hostess is delightful and what looks like a manager and possibly an owner we're on the floor hands on making sure everything was moving smoothly and everyone was happy. Really a phenomenal job!  My only request is that you bring back the warm baguette  with butter and jam  it is the simplest pleasures that are the best",
      "So disappointed :( used to come eat here 2-3 times a week and I came back today craving the eggs Benedict and they refused to make it for me because it was 12:15Really?!? They always used to make it for me and sometimes I would come in at 1:30 in the afternoon and they would always make it for me but I guess the people have changed and so has the service :-/ Must be why there were only 2 people there eatingToo bad.. I always bragged about this place to everyone and now I guess I have to take it to the other French restaurant a few blocks away. Thank goodness there are so many good ones downtown. I will miss you Cafe Bastille! We had a good run together for the last 3 yrs but now it's time to move on.",
      "Café Bastille in Miami is a great place to go for delicious and well prepared food and much more in a cool and relaxed atmosphere. I really like the location and everything that they have available here. The staff here is very friendly and accommodating to make sure that you have a great meal.",
      "Loved our brunch.  We arrived a couple days before a cruise and decided to try this place out.  It was delicious.  Service and food was great!"

      "A great cheap meal option!! FOODFrita suprema: I think the plantains and slab of cheese elevate this so much and makes it less salty/fry. If you're hungry, I recommend getting an app or sharing something else as well. Yucca: a little disappointed in this because it was $4 for so little yucca. It was really well fried though. SERVICE Service was good, got our waters topped off multiple times. It's a diner style though so it's not like they come and check in on you. MISC there's limited parking in the lot in front but also plenty of street parking.",
      "This was delicious. Had seen this restaurant reviewed on YouTube and have meant to check it out with each visit and we finally made it and it's worth it.  Zero% fancy diner.  Tons of options but I knew what to order from YouTube.  Looks like a hefty portion; meat is thin so a double is not an unreasonable order.  This had plantains, hamburger and a good helping of queso.  Bread was light.  Soooo good.  Will return.",
      "Nothing fancy, but good cheap food. A group of us came before closing and we didn't feel rushed.They have a good number of shakes. The trigo (wheat) shake was definitely interesting, a little sweet and filling. We got the yuca frita (fried yuca) and frita doble. I liked the frita doble as it was flavorful and I enjoyed the crunch from the fries; definitely recommend it. The yuca frita were good, but nothing special.Service was good and friendly. However, they forgot two dishes so we canceled them since they were closing soon. We were not charged for the two forgotten dishes.",
      "It turns out this is a small chain.  But it was highly recommended, so we made a point of visiting.It's like a diner inside.  Service was mediocre in terms of how long we had to wait after being seated.  Also food delivery was slow.We ordered the vaca frita, sopa pollo, and a filetillo plate.  Plus flan.  They frita was never delivered, and we weren't charged for it.  I don't know why.  Given how slow they were, I didn't bother asking.The sopa pollo was nothing special.  The filetillo was very flavorful.  The meat was well-seasoned.  I would love to know the seasoning mix so I could do it at home.  The flan was flan.  Pretty good, but nothing special.The one thing this place is known for (apparently) is the beef, and that certainly was very good.  Everything else was fine, but nothing special.  Service was friendly, but slow and scarce.",
      "The food is absolutely amazing! The service was amazing and the staff is very nice. Feels like a old school atmosphere. 10/10 recommend this spot forFoodies or someone looking for good burgers! Fritas con queso !!!",
      "I've been wanting to come here for a long time now. Not sure why I've never bothered to come on all my visits to Miami. The inside is very spacious and they have a lot of workers there. I understand that Cubans are very laid back people, but damn where the hell is my food?I ordered their Frita Especial con Queso. I should have ordered their double honestly. But that's my fault. They initially took forever to take my order; and after placing it, I thought it would come out within 5 minutes. 25 minutes go by and no Frita. I had to ask what the hell was going on. I guess my order slip fell, so they never made my order. I then relieved my Frita shortly after that. I also asked one of their workers for a refill on my water, she said sure, but never returned. The Frita itself was delicious. A ground beef patty with onions and potato chips on top. You get this greasy patty, crunchy potato chips and soft bread to make this amazing \"burger.\" The bun is kind of thick though, so I would have preferred more meat, so I will definitely be ordering a double next time and their supreme as well.",
      "Food Memories are tricky.  They get triggered by sounds, smells, and cravings....On this latest visit, how I remembered the Frita with Platanos and what was delivered on my plate was distinctly dysfunctional.The Beauty of this burger concoction was its balance of sweet and savory and the conflicting textures.This time around the burger was over seasoned, over cooked and partially burnt.  We didn't achieve balance.  The service while friendly, was a little off as well.Don't know when the next craving will hit -- but not sure I'll be returning.",
      "What can I say but this place had some tasty food.  We were exhausted, sick, hot, sleepy.  We needed coffee for the long drive home and the Cuban coffee was strong and good. The lady behind the counter even though she spoke no English was really nice and helpful.  Again, I need a tutor for some Spanish lessons so I can communicate better. She suggested which was the most popular frita and we got the original and one with egg.  It was definitely different but good. The meat was a little salty and greasy. The beef empanada wow I've had lots of these but this one was light buttery and so good, I'm craving this now thinking about it and will have to stop by again. The flan with coconut, wow great flavor. Overall, I'll stop here every time I am in town.",
      "Saw this place featured on Netflix and ran to it as fast I could when we were in Miami. There were 6 people ahead of me in line at the window and it took nearly 20 minutes for them just to take my order. Also no one that I noticed spoke any English there which is not uncommon when in Little Havana. I ordered a Frito Doble con Queso, basically their version of a double cheeseburger. It took another twenty minutes for it to come out.Whatever I went through to get this burger was 100% worth it. My bun was super fresh, soft, and doughy. The beef patties, which I can only describe as beef chorizo patties were mmm salty and was just intensely flavorful! Onions added a nice bite to it too. But cmon the ocean of potato crisps in my burger made this experience one unlike any other. I watched my wife's eyes roll back into her head lol. One of my top 5 all time favorite burgers!",
      "Always a great place to stop to get an authentic Cuban meal in the heart of Little Havana.  Stopped by today and indulged in an authentic Cuban sandwich, frituras de malanga (super good), and order of tostones.  This place also has diet Jupina and Materva which tend to be hard to find in diet form.  Today we splurged and we got home made buñuelos (almost balled my eyes out reminiscing on how much I use to love my mom's buñuelos) and guarapo juice made fresh (ask for plenty of ice in this)! Don't miss this place. It's fantastic and an original.  So much better than the \"other\" Cuban restaurant that everyone raves about that is just down the block from this place. Servers were spectacular and I felt like I was home in my Cuban aunt's house having one of her perfect Meals.  Try their fritas with homemade tiny itty bitty papitas deep fried to perfection and placed all over the hot frita.  Yum!!  See you soon, Rey de las Fritas!!!"

      "That the Dolphins won and (squeaked) into the playoffs made it that much sweeter! I stopped in at the tail end of an impromptu semi UYE with a few fellow yelpers after a morning of adulting. Our group had a booth near the bar and right in front of the TV  showing the Dolphins-Jets game.Culinarily, few things go with sports on TV better than a beer and some meat, and Tap 42 hit the spot. They had a good variety of local brews, of which I enjoyed the Funky Buddha Floridian Hefeweizen. It had a nice wheat color ands smooth flavor, pleasantly light for a Sunday Funday.  Served with nicely crispy fries, and both ketchup & bbq sauce included for dipping, the ribs themselves were glazed with a sweet bbq sauce and generous on the tender, fall off the bone meat. The full rack is definitely a full rack and you may end up leaving a few them.Service was fairly attentive; our waitress checked on us during the meal and was helpful in resolving a little Happy Hour billing snafu.Their patio is also pet friendly and Luna made a yorkie friend as well.",
      "Aside from the inside smelling like a smelly feet locker room and the music being played at volume 9000, the food was good. Chicken Lettuce Wraps  8.1/10 (Korean Style Marinated & Grilled Chicken * Sweet Soy Glaze * Butter Lettuce Cups) pretty delicious. Love Korean marinated meat. Great topping sauces as well Crispy Asian Calamari Tower  8.9/10 (Asian Slaw * Sweet & Sour Sauce * Scallions * Sesame Ginger Drizzle) huge calamari's pieces that were very tender. Had GREAT dipping sauce. Truffle Street Corn Guacamole 9.5/10 (Bar Rita Signature Guac * Charred Corn * Truffle Crema * Cotija Chile-Lime Spice) this was spectacular. Some may say life changing",
      "This restaurant is a cool vibe on a Sunday. My main and only gripe was that the music was BLASTING. It was so loud you couldn't even converse. If this was a day party / restaurant I'd understand the need for the high volume but it didn't give those vibes at all. Nonetheless the food was great! The only reason I took a star off was due to the volume of the music (the playlist was fire though - just turn it down a notch lol).",
      "Little Sunday fun day took place and tap 42 was our spot this week. The servers were very nice about looking for our particular games with hometown teams. For brunch time no reservations except for really large groups didn't mean that we had a long wait. Just the opposite, I was able to get a booth and wait for everyone who was parking (it's midtown. Parking is terrible.) I tried a seltzer from funky Buddha that was tasty and light, and the other went into the draft list (no sours unfortunately) and one did the endless mimosa/Bloody Mary (this ends at 3 so watch your time and service if it's after 1 to make sure you get the anticipated drinks for dollars in). The grilled wings were tasty and a nice break (sauce your own) from a traditional Buffalo. The green eggs and ham was on the smaller side portion wise but also quite good.",
      "Excellent service and food once we were seated. Outside seemed to have limited service. The portions are huge, so don't over order your apps.",
      "We all know Tap42 never disappoints. It's always a reliable stable. This review is for the Truffle Guac (not pictured) because EVERYTIME I GET IT I wonder who the heck came up with this heavenly dish. It's everything I love with good texture, sweet truffle crema served with warm chips. This dish is top 5 in my life. I tried the poke bowl for the first time which was very scrumptious. I added jalapeños for some extra spice",
      "Loved the atmosphere and the music. Went on a Friday night. Was seated outside without being asked if I preferred inside or outside. Our waiter was David, he just did his job. I think he was aggravated with one of his other tables who didn't want to pay their bill. Overall the food was good, nothing special. The drink I had was really good, nice and strong. That's all I can say about this restaurant.",
      "This is one of my new local go to spots. We come here often for happy hour from 5 to 7 PM during the week for drink specials ( make sure you ask if your drink selection is part of  the happy hour or expect to pay double be warned )  and discounted light bites. The chicken wings are great. The ribs are absolutely delicious. Salmon tosttones and chicken fingers are also very good. Staff is always friendly and accommodating. They also allow you to bring your dog which I really appreciate it.I absolutely love their prohibition burger! So tasty and the truffle fries are amazing! It never disappoints!!!.Half price burgers on Mondays from 4 to close",
      "Just got in town and found this place on yelp. Let's get right to it the food was a 4 to 4.5. I had the Truffle Filet Steak Sandwich and split the Spicy Salmon Tostones both were excellent choices. Looking at the happy hour specials I think the best time for a good deal would be right after work.  Now I have one critic the service was extremely slow and it was not crowded. When we sat down, they put us in an area with 10 empty tables and only 1 other table occupied. We didn't see a waiter till we asked the extremely nice hostess if anyone was assigned to the area. The night continued with that theme of just slow service but I won't let that take away from the food. So overall great food choice but bring a friend, so if the service is slow, you will have someone to kill the time.",
      "I went here for brunch over the weekend with family that was in town. I had never been but always saw it poppin at brunch time so thought we should try it out! We got there right at noon when they opened and it was completely empty, which was kind of nice. The hostess was pretty unfriendly to us. Our server made up for it though and was very nice to us.The apps were so good - especially the elote guac and calamari tower. Yum!!For my entree I got the pulled pork Benedict. I was expecting a little more...it was decent but didn't hit the spot. I may have just ordered the wrong thing because everyone else loved their entrees, especially my husband and my brother-in-law who both got the Tres Leches French Toast. That was soooo good! Will definitely go here again.",
      "I really loved the vibe of this place - so bustling  and aesthetic and really nice lights everywhere -  So I had to get a meal here on my trip to Miami.At least an order for pickup for Barbecue Grilled Chicken Breast with a side of roasted Brussels Sprouts. The order was ready much before the pickup time so I was really happy.The chicken was so so perfect and tender cooked I was shook!  Literally really so delicate and I just have no words I even saved some for the next day and it was just as soft!The barbecue sauce had something to it .. I don't know what, but it is a really good one.The  Brussels Sprouts were really good!  Got a good aroma as soon as I open that box.  They had some sauce over there ... I don't know what it was, but it just went really well. They were also roasted perfectly and cooked just right."

Staff is super friendly, place is clean and they have many options at a good (really good) prices.We also had the flautas, crunchy and delicious. I'm Mexican so you can 100% trust my review, grateful I found a good local spot for my cheat meal",
      "Coming from California ... Yelpers hands-down this is the best authentic Mexican food in Miami!I had a steak burrito here with no cheese that was absolutely delicious. You can get their burrito with any type of meat you would like from pork, beef or chicken. I love the fact that they were very welcoming even though they did speak great English. They TRIED which I was happy about and I spoke the best Spanish I could to make sure my order was correct!It is a small restaurant/ business with table to eat for 2. The owner was awesome and wanted to make sure I was taken care of.  They are originally from Cali which was awesome! Great food I'll definitely be back.Thank you so much for this yummy burrito",
      "Wonderful staff.  The front desk lady was extremely courteous and organized!!  They had hand sanitizer ready but most importantly.. freakishly delicious tacos, OMG i had the three tacos, one al pastor and one de res and one chorizo and wowed so good all three hit the spot!!   Also the guacamole and chips..  incredibly good n fresh. A must return for me.. not many tables though so other than the small space wow unreal flavors.  Thank you very grateful customer.",
      "The delicious steak and chicken burrito with guac. Oh my goodness they give you sauces to eat with the food and they are bomb.",
      "The food had its ups and downs... overall good. For starters, the guacamole was fresh, but lacked taste/flavor. The chips on the other hand, had a great authentic and fresh taste. Definitely home made. The Birria tacos were exceptional to say the least! Had lots of flavor and tasty, cheesy and more than well portioned! Delicious! The elote was on the same boat with the guacamole. Lacked flavor, but had a nice bold and flavorful cojita cheese on top. I added paprika/cayenne and it was great! Will come back to try the Enchiladas Verdes. Super inexpensive too and great customer service!",
      "This place is a hole in the wall and I really want to support it because the staff is so friendly and nice and I can tell they are working super hard. I appreciate it so much to see them put so much hard work and effort. But the place....It has its pros and cons. The tacos are GIANT. for $8 you get three loaded tacos! Its really a great deal. However I found them to be too big to fit in my mouth and also very greasy. I wasn't in love it it. Is it a great place to pick up and maybe have some extra tortillas? Yes probably a better idea. Its not really a dine in spot because the space is limited. I liked the Red Salsa, very flavorful and spicy. it was a plus for me. But back to the taco, I thought the Pastor was way too greasy, I felt a little unwell all night after that. The barbacoa was good, juicy fresh meat. The Carne Asada was dry and hard in my opinion and I wouldn't do that again. The Carnitas was very well done and definetly what I would order 3x. This place is slammed though, the take out orders dont stop so maybe I got a mediocre batch and need to give it another try. More tacos? Why not?!"

      "My partner and I had a great experience at bartaco. We walked in and were immediately greeted by super friendly staff who gave us an option of either indoor dining or outdoor dining- We opted for outdoor as it was a beautiful night!We sat down and found that you order from your phone, so we first placed an order for some drinks and apps. Drinks-wise, I enjoyed the sangria the most, and they included lots of cut up fruit that we enjoyed after finishing the drink. The guac had a great texture and the salsa verde had the perfect amount of heat! The chips came in large rounds and you break them apart yourself, which I found to be a fun and different element to the eating experience.After enjoying our apps, we ordered some tacos and, of course, a children's quesadilla (who doesn't love a good quesadilla??). My personal favorites were the duck taco and the tuna taco. The shrimp taco was good too, though more spicy than we were expecting, so be warned! We will very likely come back at some point, whether it be their Miami location or in another city on our travels.",
      "If you're in the mood for tacos in the Wynwood area other than the hole in the walls, this is the place. Bartaco is a lovely restaurant with really nice aesthetics and the music is selection is awesome. The restaurant has and indoor/outdoor area that was absolutely lovely and the indoor area has a big bar with booths around it. We were sat pretty quickly and the menu and concept of the restaurant was explained- menu is in form of a QR Code. You can order as many times as you want and the food is made fresh to order. Also, keep in mind it is 1 taco per order therefore, make sure to order as many tacos as you plan to eat in that one order. A cool concept was the blue card on every table; when placed up, a waiter will come and assist with any questions you may have. One of the managers was Sabrina who was super sweet and very attentive to everyone in the restaurant that- she was amazing. In fact the customer service in general was great!! For drinks we had the Mexican Tecate Larger which was pretty good. As for our tacos, we had the following: Baja Fish- absolutely delicious! (10/5)Chili-lime Shrimp- needed a bit more flavor but really good nonetheless. (4/5) Sesame Ribeye- a bit too sweet (3/5)Glazed pork belly- a bit dry (3/5)Roasted duck- delicious! (5/5)Overall, nice experience, concept, and customer service was excellent. Nice restaurant to sit down and have some tacos amongst other type of \"Mexican food\" if you don't feel like eating in a small and crowded place.",
      "I am soooo confused with the reviews below! This place is TRASH! One of the worst taco experiences I've ever had. Loved the concept of having an outdoor area for some quick tacos and then the inside to have the full menu. I was excited to try this place. The ambiance was cool airy, hip right in the heart of wynwood. Nice Latin music to cater to the neighborhood, the staff was very welcoming and nice. However, the food was TRASH! The short rib taco was the driest and the most tasteless tacos I've ever had in my life. The short rib was over cooked extremely hard in texture, no flavor whatsoever, hard to chew and the presentation was very disappointing. My friends ordered the beef bowl and the chicken verde bowl. Another huge disappointment. The beef bowl was also tastes less and the beef was chewy like gum. The veggies tastes more Asian style than what a taco bowl is suppose to taste like. I would never recommend this restaurant or stop by this place again. I see the potential but failed with the execution. Never again",
      "We have been here twice and the atmosphere is nice. They have good prices, both times we sat at the bar, the drinks were good. The staff are nice the food is good but not traditional it's more of an Asian fusion. We will definitely be back as we have enjoyed it just don't come craving authentic Mexican food. Try the churros.",
      "We have been in Miami for three days and we have experienced nothing but rude people and we've been disappointed with all the restaurants. This was our first positive experience and they went above and beyond. All the staff here was extremely friendly and helpful with everything. The food was the best we've tried since we've been in the city. In fact, I think these are probably the best tacos I've ever had and that says a lot considering I grew up in Southern California with Mexican food everywhere. I don't think you can go wrong no matter what you order on the menu. We tried multiple types of tacos and they were all amazing.",
      "There are many options in Wynwood for Mexican food. The place across the street had a line out the door so we checked out Bartaco. No wait. Great indoor and outdoor seating options. The food was good and the service was friendly however the pricing is too high given the portion sizes.",
      "Stopped in on a whim and enjoyed some yummy food. The ambiance inside is very nice and chill and the staff were friendly. I thought it was interesting that you use the menu to mark what you want with a pencil. Very sushi-place for a taco-place. We ordered 2 special tacos from outside (lobster and steak) and then a couple from inside (chicken and fish). All were small but yummy. We also got the duck bowl that was good. Honestly, the best part of our meal was the ginger mint iced tea carafe (I know!) but it was perfectly sweet and refreshing.",
      "- I've been to their chain location in Virginia so was excited to try this place- Order individually on your phones or on one phone together-  Their cocktails don't really taste of alcohol. Not in a good way but in a bad way. Seems like they've skimped on the booze.- The taco was so tiny so you probably need 3-5 to feel fulfilled and even that counts as a snack - They have inside and outside seating- The outdoors is decorated really well- Service was great- Great for large groups",

      "Living in Miami for about a year, I have been trying new restaurants on the weekends. I have yet to go to a place that is like Bartaco. The food was absolutely delicious. As a Mexican, I can tell you that these tacos honor authenticity while bringing in modern elements. The customer service was absolutely amazing. The staff greeted us immediately and made sure we were taken care of since it was our first time. You will not find $3.00 tacos that are impeccable anywhere else!! I loved it here!!!",
      "Obsessed with this place! The quality of the food was just as good as the ambiance. Drinks were good and strong and I just love the order as you go concept straight from your phone. My personal faves were the esquites, the fried fish taco and the pork belly tacos! So fresh and full of flavor, just an overall great experience."

I also got the rice and beans and grilled shrimp and this was incredible as well. Logistically there are tips of street parking spots (during the weekend) and the entrance is on the side by the subway.",
      "Multiple place here. Love atmosphere and the folks, assume are the owners always see them very nice.  I love the flavors i inly woshbit had more choices for vegetarians",
      "If you work near University of Miami Medical School or Jackson Memorial Hospital, this IS the Creole food spot to go to.They used to have lunch specials, but they no longer offer it.I recommend the stewed chicken (it is not in the official paper menu, you have to ask) since it is quite filling and affordable for only $13.They replaced the previous creole place that was located in the same plaza. I would say this place is more \"refined\" and has a less homely/grandma made it vibe compared to the previous place. Nevertheless, I would still urge people to stop by and try it!",
      "Food so damn good Amazing customer service everyone is nice over there. Definitely recommend this place",
      "Authentic haitian food! The food is flavored so well!Wonderful customer service! They always have black rice with the real taste not the fake one with black Maggie!Will definitely recommend! I have been back plenty time!!!",
      "Once the Miami foodies discover this joint, the reservation is gonna go 3 to 4 weeks out. Since it quietly opened in April, I had walk past this place to and from work nearly every day, but somehow it never occurred to me to try it until I saw it on Ubereats. I figure I will order food from there and then just bring it home for dinner. Wow wow wow, boy it was delicious! I tried the goat stew, which was pretty much the epitome of Caribbean meat stew, with a mix of spice, savory and exotic flavors. The pork my partner ordered was magically, perfectly seasoned and extremely soft, and the accompanying rice (both the dark and brown) were pretty much entrées onto themselves. And the servings were huge! Unstopping mouth-gasms. This is the kind of place I wish they have more of in Brickell and Wynwood, and who knew it was just tucked away in a quiet medical school campus. This joint is a destination itself.",
      "I visited this place and was so satisfied with the food, tasty and made to order. I was sold from the first meal and didn't eat anywhere else for my stay in Miami for the week. I basically tried everything in the menu and enjoyed each one of them, distinctively! I recommend this place to anyone who wants to activate their tastebuds to eat there, and you won't regret. Clean and neat!",
      "This is a local gem. This is my home away from home. Whenever Im in the mood for good Haitian food, I just order from Gregs. Good customer service, food is always point. You should try the Tasso Kabrit-Fried Goat- very tender and delicious.",
      "The food here was sooo good  I have been at least 3x already.. it's the whole fried snapper for me.. don't go here dressed like you going to a 5star restaurant although I have it five stars .. casual dine in experience but food is good.. price the price of going outside these days lol.. either you in the house or you outside ‍.. but it's worth it check it out",
      "My first time having Haitian food and This food is delicious! Everything we had was. Id recommend. Expect a wait because everything is made from scratch"

      "Hands down my favorite restaurant in Miami. Ambiance is upbeat and intimate. Food is AMAZING does not miss in the year I've been going consistently. Service is outstanding .",
      "Amazing steakhouse Our favorite was the the Australian Wagyu which I can only say was perfection. their sides were so perfectly complimentary. Truffle Mac and cheese, the Brussels sprouts, spinach, broccolini and cauliflower were excellent. Beef lettuce wraps were decent, beet salad was good, kids meals were devoured. ALSO if you're here for breakfast their buffet is great",
      "WOW - To say I was completely blown away by my first time dining here would be an understatement. Whether you're celebrating a special occasion or just craving a delectable meal that will leave you speechless, this is the spot that will be sure to leave a lasting impression. From the lavish and trendy decor, the out of this world dishes, beautiful presentations and impeccable service, every detail was taken well into consideration and perfected.I can say with certainty that this is one of the most gorgeous spaces I've ever eaten a meal in. The sultry vibe, elegantly designed interior, endless display of wine bottles scattered throughout the restaurant and the stunning bar will have you feeling like you're in the midst of dining amongst celebrities. There didn't seem to be a bad table to dine at in sight, but my parents and I were lucky enough to snag one of the beautiful half-moon booths toward the center of the room. When is the last time you've been to a restaurant that brings complimentary French fries to the table? And not just any regular ole' French fries, but a delicious trio of French fries each complimented by their own unique dipping sauce? Bet it's probably never happened before, unless you've eaten here. I thought this was such a neat but simple touch that really set them apart from other high-end restaurants. They also bring yummy rolls topped with sea salt to the table (between the fries & the bread, you might end up in a food coma before you even order if you're not careful). I ordered the tuna tartar for an appetizer and I was in heaven every time I took a bite. Not only does it melt in your mouth, but the presentation alone is enough reason to order this (the way they mix it for you makes for a fun video opportunity if you have your phone ready to record). My parents shared a shrimp cocktail that they both enjoyed - The shrimp were massive! Following the appetizers, I munched on a cesar salad which was perfectly dressed. Now... the STEAK. Holy moly, one of the best filet mignons I have had yet. It was ridiculously flavorful, tender & juicy. Melted in your mouth and bursted with flavor. If you're a steak lover, it would be a crime to come here and not order it. The mashed potatoes that accompanied it were also flavorful, but I thought they were a little too runny (my only complaint of the whole meal). If you're a fan of grilled onions, do yourself a favor and order a side of these to top your steak with and thank me later. The \"Smoked Chocolate S'mores\" dessert was ridiculously decadent and was the perfect finish to an impeccable meal. Yes, it's insanely pricy and yes, it's totally worth it. My experience here was one of the best dining experiences I've ever had in Miami - And that says a lot given the fact that Miami is one of the hottest spots in the country for foodies. This restaurant hit it out the park for me and I'm already searching for an excuse to go back to South Florida and to savor new dishes on their menu.",
      "The restaurant is spacious and nice. Bar is nice as well.Staff was friendly and attentive.For appetizers the tuna tartare was fresh and seasoned well.They also bring you French fries 3 different ways with 3 different sauces. I had the certified Angus rib cap cooked medium rare and It was good and flavorful. The side of Mac and Cheese was good as well.",
      "Our favorite was the the Australian Wagyu which I can only say was perfection.",
      "Ambiance was awesome. The dishes, coctails and the dessert were so delicious. All the employees were so polite and friendly. They celebrated our honeymoon with a cute card, it was so nice.They made our special day unforgettable.",
      "Wonderful experience! Fabulous service. Timing, everything was a 10.  Our server really made our night fabulous, she was awesome. Great steak, Mac and cheese with truffle was really nice. Molten cake was super good as well. I must say everything was impeccable.",
      "Phenomenal cuisine. Never have a enjoyed such a succulent and flavourful sea bass - it is one of their renowned specials. But the lack of bones in the fish was made up for by the pained bones in my rear.The decor was beautiful but very far from comfortable. The low chairs were too uncomfortable for eating. The benches; built for slaves.The overall experience was truly hampered by a god awful designer deserving of life in prison for her domestic terror on comfort. 4/5 not bad",
      "This plus is amazing! We had a private room & our server was Erin. Erin was very pleasant, patient, informative & very professional. She suggested several appetizers & dinner. It was our first time visiting this restaurant & it definitely won't be our last.",
      "Food was incredible. I love that when you get to the table instead of getting some bread you get french fries. Service was also impeccable and ambiance is very family friendly in my opinion"

      "Overall: Amazing food. We will definitely be back! The Great: - Biscetta allá Fiorantina. We got the serving for 2. Incredible. - Tiramisu OMG - get it. - Tableside Caesar - Very nice server - Ben - Foccacia bread The good: - Meatball App - The wine cellar and steak presentation as you walk in is a nice touch General feedback: - Dimming the lights a bit more would give it some real ambiance and a homier feel  - They JUST opened so cut the staff some slack. I've been on a team opening a restaurant before and it's so hard. They did great! - Good location - easy access with ample parking. A local steakhouse is just what the neighborhood needs - The staff was really sweet and everyone was really working hard all night.",
      "Went here for a birthday dinner. They have a great menu with all sorts of selections.  Our waiter was pushy and rude.  We ordered a NY Strip, Branzino, Pasta Bolonaize, Filet Minan, truffle fries and salad.  The steaks were ordered medium well done.  All the food was good except the steaks.  They kept bringing back the steaks rare and the waiter was angry with nasty comments toward us.  If you go here avoid this guy.  We told the mgr who seemed surprised.",
      "The staff and Marco was amazing! The food, absolutely Devine, the portion the flavor, the attention to detail were all perfection. Thank you for making my husband's 40th bday so memorable.",
      "Hello my name is Nick. Of course I'm from New York. I usually don't write reviews specially bad ones we got to this nice restaurant very gorgeous inside. The bread was delicious. I have to say the first course was a pasta dish we split. It had a Bolognese sauce on it it was served hot and good. Little did I know that was the highlight of a dinner. My steak came out first they cut it up which I wasn't crazy about but it was cold. my friends ordered a veal dish a special order. They accommodated them but the dish also was ice cold. The dish presentation was very nice but it being cold was definitely a problem. I must mention the sides to twice cook baked potato was a baked potato not twice cooked. The cream spinach was nice fresh baby spinach sautéed with melted cheese on top. The menu, said cream of spinach. I do wish they would get their act together, and I would even consider trying it again. The Decour is very elegant. It was Christmas Eve. We got there at 6:15 and it wasn't that busy. There was no excuse for the cold food. I must say I was very disappointed. My name is nick hogan.",
      "Nice bar.  Quality food.   Good service    Except bartender Angie.  Good wine and liquor selection",

Just like his song, our experience was great! The place feels intimate and has a great ambiance for a date night. The food was also incredible! Yet, the best part was the service. Our server Andrea was so sweet and helpful the entire night. I highly recommend!",

      "Perfect place for date night! The food was amazing and the staff very friendly and attentive. Can not go wrong with the BURRATA CAPRESE for starter and my favorite the FILETTO DI MANZO! So many tasty options can't wait to go back next time I am in town!"

      "Seaspice was amazing. It's a fantastic restaurant with a great view right on the Miami River. If you don't right you can catch the live music as the sun sets, and the restaurant transforms to a lounge. Totally worth coming Parking is tricky, and if you're not paying attention you might miss it as you drive by. But it's a gem worth coming back to.",
      "Seaspice is known to Miami locals as a very high end resturant, frequented by celebrities.  I have no idea why.  The service is pretty awful.  The drink runners are horrible.  It takes about 30 minutes for just a drink to be brought out to you.  The food is mediocre.  It is definitely NOT worth the price, which is very expensive.  I am giving two stars because the view is amazing.  Seaspice is right on the water and has a gorgeous ambiance.  You can watch yachts drive by and some will even pull up and park.  The other star is for the tres leches.  This dessert was AMAZING, I would go back just to eat it again.  But otherwise, Seaspice is nothing special.  Save your money.",
      "A place that tries to be high end but fails to deliver.Service ? Mediocre Food ? Below parFirst thing when you check in is they tell you that you have a 2 hr max(tacky)",
      "I read this was one of the best patio dining AND a hot spot for celebrities in Miami, so I had to go check it out on our recent travels to this area...Initially I was worried about our luggage situation, as we had to carry our luggage to the restaurant since this was our last stop in Miami. However, they were very accommodating, and let us store some of our stuff in the closet, and we kept the big luggage with us, near our table.As expected, the patio scene was spectacular...city skyline and seaside views, with plenty of yachts passing by! The place indeed had that chic celebrity vibe...truly FAB! Loved the music overhead as well. Somehow, I expected some snobbiness...but not at all. Service was great!Then the food. OMFG...I've had some amazing foods lately, but this takes the cake. Even the complimentary bread was amazing (and unique)! My husband ordered this Wagyu Burger, and I chose this Ragu Pappardelle ( THE best Ragu Pappardelle I've ever had...EVER. ). Then this Pavola dessert...again, just beyond delish. Truly, this was foods for the celebrities.Honestly, I'm shocked at how low the rating is for this place. I assume that if the service isn't top notch, it would probably piss some folks off. The pricing was on the outlandish side...with even lunch entrees starting at around 40. There was even an appetizer item priced at around 70 bucks! Luckily, like I said, I felt that the foods and the service (and especially the spectacular ambiance) made up for it. There was this big yacht parked right near us, which somewhat blocked some of the views from the left. Still, we got our eyeful of seaside/yachtside views.In any case, this was a great way to end our trip in Miami.",
      "Went here with a group of girlfriends for brunch and everything was delicious, they were super accommodating as well.I had the froze , a cucumber and gin cocktail and 2 grey goose and sodas and all were fantastic.As a table we split the fresh fish and a couple sides and it was delicious. Also love the free bread It is definitely on the pricier side overall tbh but great for a fun \"fancy\" brunch",
      "Came here for Miami spice and although we spent more than we thought we would, we had a good time. Everything was delicious. The kale Caesar had pecans and Granny Smith apple slices, never had a Caesar like this but it was a nice change! The Shrimp Pesto Whole Wheat Spaghetti was my favorite, even though I'm not the biggest fan of pesto. The burger was good too just a little messy from the truffle aioli. The chocolate cremoso and tres leches was very good but I'd go with the cremoso for the cocoa nib crumble, yum! All in all, I think it's overpriced and I probably won't come here again because of that. The cheapest bottle of Chardonnay was $75 and most drinks were $20. I only came here for Miami spice and still spent almost $200.",
      "Given we still have Miami Spice going on until the end of the month we decided to try out the lunch menu @ Seaspice gorgeous location on the Miami River, sitting outdoor is really relaxing, so beautiful to watch the boats go by, really lovely To start we had the Comte' Cheese Soufflé, I have to admit this was a bit disappointing, it really did not have the texture of a real soufflé  but then............ the Shrimp Pesto Whole Wheat Spaghetti and the Pan-Seared Chilean Seabass were really good as dessert, both the Tres Leches and the Chocolate Cremoso were yummy Try it out before Miami Spice ends, you can check out the Miami Spice Menus on miamiandthebeaches.com@seaspicemia",
      "First time for me at Seaspice, it is located on the banks of the Miami River it is a gem that you should not miss. Sit outside in the courtyard enjoy your food and a drinks while watching the boats go by, just beautiful We had the Miami Spice lunch which has a very affordable fix price 3 course menu for $ 28, unfortunately this will end soon, nevertheless, I would defiantly go back again for sureRegarding the Miami Spice menu only one observation, they should have had more than one choice for the Entrees without the extra charge, right now you have 4 choices and 3 of these have extra charge on it, not really fair given that you are promoting the Spice menu, you should have at least two or three choices included in the price and one or two with the extra charge We had had Prince Edward Island Mussels, Grilled, the Grilled Faroe Island Salmon and the Profiteroles and Peaches and Cream. My favorite where the Mussels, the garlic pizza bread they brought for the table was absolutely delicious, the Salmon was good too. I had the Peaches for dessert and it was ok, not really my thing, my friend said the Profiteroles were great, next time I will not opt for the healthy dessert We enjoyed all with a good Albariño wine, our experience was made especially enjoyable by our waiter Fabrizio, he was really great ! Thank you Fabrizio @seaspicemia",
      "Bad first impression. Its not a nice feeling to feel like you have to beg to spend your money at a restaurant. Every year I look forward to Miami Spice. It's a great way to try out various restaurants and a unique spread of menu options. Seaspice was on my radar and happened to be one of the participating restaurants offering the Miami Spice menu. I contacted the restaurant in advance and made a reservation for 3:30p for a party of four. My mom who is from out of town was excited to join us for lunch. I advised the restaurant we were doing the Miami Spice menu. The restaurant made it clear that they charge $50pp for No Shows. At 3:15pm, we arrived for our reservation. The hostess Karin greeted us, and advised us that they were running behind on the reservations and because of this they will not be able to offer the Miami Spice menu. Only the a la-carte menu will be offered. This was a bit upsetting because we drove almost an hour to get there and the restaurant is refusing to offer the Miami Spice promotion. Our natural instinct was to just say forget it we will go somewhere else. I mean, at the end of the day who wants to beg to spend their money? It's absurd. If the restaurant is offering a promotional menu and because to no fault of our own they are running behind why should we be penalized?My Mom looked so bummed out. Because she was so excited to try this place. I decided to walk back in and ask for a Manager. The Manager took 20min to come out. When he finally did come over, he introduced himself as Collin. I explained to him what was going on and it seemed as though he wasn't aware that the hostesses were turning Miami Spice customers away. He decided to make it right and advised Karin to honor the Miami Spice menu. Impressive! Things were turning around. Besides the encounter at the hostess stand, the restaurant is beautiful. It is situated on Miami's waterfront were you can view the million dollar yachts passing by. They also have docks for those interested in docking and dining. You can view the downtown city skyline which I am sure looks amazing at night.The food was excellent. The Miami Spice menu offered a three course lunch for $28. You have the choice of a starter (Kale Salad, Cheese Souffle, or White Gazpacho). A choice of entrees (Seabass, Chicken Breast, Shrimp Pesto Pasta, Wagyu Burger, or Plant Bowl). And a choice of dessert (Tres Leches or Chocolate Cremoso). They also offer the option to add a Glass of wine for and additional $12. I ordered the Comte Cheese Souffle, the Green Circle Farms Chicken Breast, and the Tres Leches. The others in my party ordered the Kale Salad, Gazpacho, and Seabass. For starters, My favorites were the Kale Caesar Salad and Cheese Souffle. The Kale Caesar had a mix of shredded Granny Smith apples, pecans and a creamy Caesar dressing. The cheese Souffle was like a fluffy egg Souffle with a cream parmesan sauce and tomato chutney. Delicious!For entrees, both the Seabass and Chicken breast were amazing. The Chicken breast was tender and juicy, served on top of a creamy polenta and topped with corn, peas, and mushrooms. The seabass was seared nicely to give a nice crunch on the outside, while perfectly flaky and moist on the inside. It was served with stewed garbanzo, Swiss chard, and smoked potato. For desserts, we all had Tres Leches. It was served in a small Mason jar topped with 3 milks, and berries. Perfect way to end the meal. The portions are not large but it is filling. The flavors are fresh and very well balanced. The food presentation was notable. The Watermelon Tequila drink was delightful and refreshing. The froze was also a big hit. The cocktails were presented well and created perfectly. We enjoyed everything. Our waiter, Austin was very friendly. He made great recommendations and was very attentive.An 18% gratuity was added to the tab. There are lots of street parking accessible. In the end, the food was great. Ambience was amazing. The hostesses can use additional customer service training and learn to use better judgment to improve the customers experience. There was no need to escalate the matters to a manager. It could have been handled properly by showing empathy, apologizing, and finding a solution to the problem.",
      "Hi Kim,Thank you for dining with us and leaving a detailed review. It has been forwarded to our management team. Our apologies for the confusion at the door.  Glad to hear Collin accommodated you and your experience was turned around.  We are happy to see your great feedback regarding the food, cocktails, and Austin’s Service.  Hopefully you will join us again in the near future!",
      "This is my second time going to sea spice & I normally love it as the first time. I never leave bad reviews But this second time MY PHONE WAS STOLEN AND SECURITIES DID NOThing about it. Instead we're trying to blame me for the situation. I'm not drunk nor was drunk. I walked in with 2 phone and walked out with 1.We came as my friend USUALLY does and this is how they treated us  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME. I thought it was 5 star so nothing could go wrong. With a security right next to our table my phone STILLL got stolen. It was on the table. And to whoever has the time to steal phones is just sad imagine what else they can steal... I wil ask to review cameras but with the way I was treated when I let them know I lost my phone I doubt they will be helpful but I'll let every platform form of review know that they steal phones here. I know the exact time frame as well so they wouldn't even have to look much at the cameras. Let's see. BTW I BEEN HOME SICK AFTER EATING THESE OYSTERS I COULDNT Even celebrate my baby's birthday w him.",
      "Came here for my birthday dinner with my boyfriend for a 7:15 reservation (we called in advance for an outdoor seat dock side) we waited about ten minutes after our arrival for our table to be ready at the bar, the short wait was definitely worth it. Started with an aperol spritz at the bar then ordered octopus and gazpacho to start. Octopus portion was good but the olive oil tasted burnt since it came out on a sizzling hot cast iron looking skillet (its very easy to overcook octopus, please just bring a regular plate next time.) I also had the whole main lobster. Extremely delicious large portion of perfectly cooked and seasoned lobster, bravo. My boyfriend had the truffle coated Chilean sea bass and he absolutely loved it. Vibe: 5/5 this place definitely is a scene but not overwhelmingly pretentious or obnoxious. Absolutely loved the music as well. Service:3/5 A bit slow, our server was very attentive when we were able to get his attention but we had to always wave him down. Food: 4/5 everything was honestly pretty good (octopus could've had a bit more attention to detail)",
      "Hi Liz,Thank you for celebrating your birthday with us!  We are so happy to hear you had a great experience and enjoyed the food.  Your feedback regarding the octopus has been sent to our chef. We look forward to seeing you again soon!"

A few years ago, after visiting all of the fancy, popular spots on our visit, I decided to research the local favorites and this topped the lists. We arrived right when they opened and we're blown away by the food. Fast forward to December, 2022, we returned to South Beach and made a reservation weeks ahead of time on Yelp for our 18th anniversary dinner, it was the one place we had to return to. It was just as we left it and far exceeded any meal we had at any other establishment. Don't miss your chance to  experience this restaurant. It brings you back in time and is so authentic and charming you will never forget it.",

Both were good but the egg plant stood out as something that tasted authentic and very well prepared.Dinners - spaghetti piccorino tossed in an aged cheese bowl, and green gnocchi with sage  Drinks - 2 bottles of vino to wash it down! Desserts- fresh piped cannoli!! Mic drop  If you're in Miami hit it up, you'll thank me later!",

Our waiter Gianluigi, gave us excellent service! I love that you can watch someone making pasta from the window outside the restaurant.Food was great! We had the grilled octopus for an appetizer, it was very fish and flavorful. I ordered the spaghetti alla ruota, I loved the cheese wheel presentation that goes with it. My sister had the Cacio e pepe, and she enjoyed it as well. For dessert, we had both the tiramisu and crème brûlée and both were delicious! Will definitely recommend this restaurant and return here.",
      "Place had great reviews and lived up to the hype. Portions seemed small but were actually quite generous and very well seasoned.  The lobster was really soft, buttery and perfectly cooked.  They also served some focaccia bread that was warm and quickly devoured. Went on Xmas eve and it was a great choice. Thanks!",
      "This is one of our favorite Italian spots in all of south Florida - the pasta is incredible. I always recommend sitting inside at this place because the ambiance of the restaurant is so intimate. We come here about once a month and always bring guests from out of town. You definitely need to make a reservation for the night time - call to make reservations and make sure to request to be seated inside. Every time we come, we do family-style so that everyone gets to try a variety of the dishes and it works out perfectly!The service is also amazing and the chef is very passionate about his craft which we love!",
      "Absolutely amazing \"the best meal\" we had in Miami. Stayed in Miami for 3 nights and canceled one of the other restaurant to come back to this one again.Their lasagna had perfect balance of the meat and the sauce. And THE BEST TIRAMISU! I will def be back!",
      "This little hidden gem in the heart of Miami Beach, where the ambiance is low key and very romantic with dimmed lights and antique decor. The staff was amazing, they truly made us feel special. We started with the cesar salad with bacon, it was fresh creamy and delicious, the bacon gave it such a savory taste. For the main course we had the gnocchi with fresh basil and red sauce, it was fantastic. The only reason for the 4 stars is because my pasta was highly recommended but it wasn't all it was hyped up to be, it lacked flavor.The staff/ manager really went above and beyond to make up for the pasta, but by that point I was fine. Definitely try the pastas with red sauce. The tiramisu was out of this world and to make up for the pasta they gave us another dessert which I don't remember the name, but it was fantastic.  I loved our experience at this restaurant and recommend everyone to stop by. Can't wait to return so I can try the lasagna. Thank you to the staff at Pane & Vino.",
      "Amazing. We were recommended this place by the front desk at the Hyatt. So glad we took his recommendation. Outstanding service, great atmosphere, and DELICIOUS food. Will be back. Everything is so fresh and literally melts in your mouth."

      "V gelato is the ULTIMATE (vegan) (dairy free)  that just opened in Wynwood! Slammmminnnnn....  (Located just outside of Wynwood walls.) The staff was extremely friendly and sociable. The Son & Mom combo \"Eric\" the GEALTO MAESTRO!!! YES GEALTO master... It was a pleasure meeting you brother! I'll be back soon... OK so lets get to the GEALTOS lol, literally the mom gave us all the gelato flavors! I couldn't choose but i TBH they were all very very good... So choose carefully LOL! Enjoy...",
      "V gelato is a *super cute* cafe that just opened on a cozy, art filled street in Wynwood. (Located just outside of Wynwood walls.) The staff was extremely friendly and sociable. We had the pleasure of meeting Johanne and C. They were very knowledgeable about their tasty vegan gelato flavors and gave us a few samples to try before we were ready to make the ultimate commitment to the scoop of our choice! Scoop prices were very reasonable adjacent to portion sizes AND biodegradable cups/utensils (environmental win.) The mural outside is colorful and beautiful reminiscent of a world made from gelato ~I would love to jump into this one. I would recommend this spot if you're in the area to enjoy the scenery, company and a delicious cool treat all at the same time. We will be back.",
      "All the flavors are sooo delicious, flavorful, creamy. And it's all DAIRY FREE.Also the chef is so passionated, nice and kind. MUST TRY!!!",
      "Truly the best gelato I have had in the USA...I tried almost every flavor and there were no misses. The mango gelato tasted like a real mango! Would 100% come back",
      "What a treat! The owner crafts his gelato to taste like ice cream while being gluten and dairy free. This is vegan gelato and is delicious. The gelato has real fruit and is not sickly sweet like some places . We were warmly greeted and given plenty of samples. Excellent customer service and super clean. We will be back."

      "The food was amazing! Conch fritters, seared scallops, grilled grouper. We sat on the first floor, next to the water. It felt like we were on a boat! Which by the way we had a boat show on the river that was fun to watch. The entertainment was great. The young man and lady were very accommodating to our requests. I even got a dance in with the manager. I highly recommend Garcia's.",
      "This place really disappointed me. My group ordered the snapper, shrimp scampi, and the creole. The worst part of every dish was the seafood. Overcooked and definitely was not cooked to order. All the food came out barely warm.  The snapper was dry and over cooked. Shrimps were really tough and were not seasoned. I expect to pay 15 dollars for this meal, but for around 25 dollars a plate I really expected more. DO NOT COME HERE.",
      "My friend suggested I visit Garcia's for fresh grilled seafood when in Miami and so I did. I took myself out for a lovely lunch to begin my vacation. I got a patio seat over looking I believe the bay. They are located next door to Casablanca. Upon entering I passed the market area and took the stairs up to the dining room. There is also an elevator you can use. You can see all the history and memories near the elevator/bathroom on their walls.I started with the large stone crab claws it came with 4 in the order. I loved the light creamy Dijon aioli that is provided with it. It's not overwhelming and compliments just right imo. I also ordered the small mixed seafood platter with grilled veggies and a salad. They had multiple sides to choose from including rice, fries, mashed potatoes, maguros and more. They also offer a daily happy hour from 4-7pm during the week. I'm visiting Miami next week and will most likely eat here again!",
      "Had one of the BEST fish dishes of my life here recently, a special of the day, Sea Bass in a green cilantro sauce... Absolutely to die for! Buttery, delicate, creamy & herbaceous! Could eat that every day. Colossal Stone Crab Claws were insane but next time we'll go for the jumbos.",
      "Always fresh & always good, albeit  WAY more expensive than I thought! I always thought of Garcia's as a casual seafood shack but don't be fooled by the rustic riverside deck. Oysters are amazing, scallop spoetizer is delish & i LOVE their conch fritters! Fresh seafood & fantastic Miami River views.",
      "My little sister's birthday is on NYE so for her day, my father wanted to take her to a miami classic, Garcia's. I'll admit, I've always been a \"Casablanca\" girl, myself but the last time I went, I was super disappointed! Menu & food quality had changed drastically & I was not a fan... anyways, back to Garcia's... my father had arrived super early (as he's prone to do) and snagged us a table, riverside. By the time we got there, there was a line to get into the takeout & fish-market but we were able to walk right in & found our table. The service was pretty terrible from the start. Everyone was super nice but all seemed to be on their own separate planets... within 30 min, we had no less than 3 waitstaff take our order, fast forward 30 more minutes & we were STILL waiting for our drinks... luckily they got it together towards the end but more importantly the food was GREAT! To start, we went with the Smoked Fish Dip (really good, but Bahamas on 8th is better), Seared Scallops in garlic and lemon sauce (DELICIOUS, perfectly cooked & the capers were an added bonus. Only wish there were more!), and Conch Fritters (SO GOOD & surprisingly light. Not greasy and really yummy batter chock full o' conch). My dad & sis also split the Fried Lobster (I stopped eating lobster a few years ago), & said it was great! For her entrée, my sis went with Stone Crab Claws & I did the Grilled Salmon with a tamarind mustard sauce. For dessert, we split the key lime pie. Everything was fantastic, SO fresh & delicious! I'm officially a Garcia's convert.",
      "This is the second time that we came here and had to return after such a great visit on a prior trip to Miami. I really loved being outside on the lovely patio area and to be able to watch the boats go by as I ate. Our group of four was seated at a four-top and given our menus as well as complimentary fish dip which was DELICIOUS!!Our server was attentive to us to take our orders but didn't really check up on us during the meal which was fine however since there were no issues. For our meals, we tried the tuna nachos, two sandwiches, and lobster which came with two sides. The tuna nachos aren't advertised as raw on the menu and although I wasn't expecting it, it was alright. I might just keep this in mind if your not used to consuming raw fish. The plating for the nachos was also a bit strange, more like deconstructed nachos but the setup didn't take away points from all the delicious flavors coming from the soy glaze and spicy mayo topping the tuna. The sandwiches both come with fries which they are very generous with. The bread is nice and soft on the sandwhiches and both the grilled chicken and fish had a nice char. Lastly the lobster was cooked perfectly, nice and simple. The tostones were also very crispy!!",

      "We were looking for stone crab, not knowing the season is not until October - but ENJOYED Garcia's nonetheless!From the amazing fish dip, samples for trying come when you sit, to the friendly service and wide range of food we couldn't have been happier to try this place out!Karen, our server, was quick to get our order in of mahi fingers for our little one and our drinks in asap (always necessary).We WILL be back for stone crab season, and often because we like an early dinner with lots of seafood options. This place seems like a locals favorite and I like that it's on the river with people watching that avoids too much of the ruckus. There's valet when you pull in too FYI (tips needed of course)",
      "Ohhhh Yes must visit and must go back, place was awesome, staff was very welcoming. Food was great!!! No bad reviews at all!I love this place, will be going back for our next date night. Thank you Garcia's",
      "Out for more seafood while in Miami and last stop before heading to Maryland. Have not enjoyed Chilean Sea-bass in a while and the time was right. Started with grouper soup that was just ok, the spice could be better. Had a shrimp cocktail with less than large version, (they must not know what jumbo or colossal shrimp are) and was disappointed, order fish spread that came with crackers (they must not have heard of bread) which did not light my fire and the sea bass was two small chunks, slightly overcooked.  Eating at a fine restaurant or when cooking this at home, it's a large chunk allowing you to sear each site, then place in the oven for the last 10 minutes, this delivers a flaky buttery fish, my dish here was not. This $34 dollar fish bites meal came with mashed potatoes and veggies i.e. 1carrot slice & 2 zucchini slices. This place has a reputation for fresh seafood but at $156.00 for my son and I with two beers, I won't be back."

I had the pleasure of meeting the chef, amazing person and super nice. The decoration is very tasteful. For those like me not accustomed to Turkish food, this is a MUST try.",

The food was fantastic. We had the zucchini pancake, skirt steak, and the Italian fish dish...everything was cooked perfectly. Our wine choices and carrot cake baklava was so tasty. Would definitely recommend. So thankful we stumbled upon this find that was a short walk from our Airbnb.",
      "Probably one of the most underrated spots in Miami. Jass Kitchen, a Turkish inspired restaurant located in design district is an experience you won't want to miss out on. I checked it out for the first time last Thursday and fell in love instantly. If you're a lover of romantic, home-y vibes like I am this is truly a gem you'll love. With live jazz music playing all night love, delicious homemade Turkish bites and a beautiful wine selection, I wish I can give it more than 5 stars. Here's what I ordered: - mante dumplings - lamb chops- Turkish sampler - carrot baklava Everything was spectacular! Mante dumplings are a must! The lamb chops were cooked to perfection and tender and the sampler was filled with flavor and authentic. Don't sleep on this spot, and save it to your must-try list, trust me!",
      "I went to this restaurant right at the beginning and I was a bit disappointed with the overall experience. Here is the breakdown:Food-The food was OK. Did not blow me away. The choices looked good but didn't enjoy the dishes we order. It was missing flavor. Service- The team was attentive but no sense of urgency except for the manager or owner who was extremely polite and friendly. She was seeking feedback so appreciate her reaching out.Ambiance-The restaurant A/C was maybe not working? It ruined the experience of the jazz and we were not able to enjoy as much. Decor- Enjoyed the decor of the restaurant. Very well decorated and unique.Overall: I would wait a bit and give the restaurant another try. I feel there is potential and I truly enjoyed their concept but for no, unfortunately, 3 stars.",
      "Hi Al! Thank you very much for your great feedback. We were very new by the time you stopped by. We are trying to fix as much as we can by the help our guests +/- feedback. Please give us another chance to fix your experience with us.",
      "I went to Jass kitchen to celebrate my partner and mother's birthday. It has great reviews and a good location by the Design District so I made a reservation. The restaurant is really beautiful. Very nice decor everywhere, even the bathrooms. The chandeliers are a nice touch, and ceiling is painted as well. The menu is an array of nice and appetizing Mediterranean dishes. There are no cocktails, only wine and beer. The only beer is Heineken and the wine menu is lacking. They serve Seaglass, Concha y Toro and other inexpensive wines at a very expensive price. We sampled the sangria but it was a bit too sweet so we stuck to just water. We ordered the zucchini pancake and kopoglu to start. The pancake was tasty, a little cold but good flavor. I couldn't really taste the halloumi in it so maybe it diced within the pancake. The kopoglu is potato, eggplant, zucchini, tomato sauce, and garlic yogurt. Unfortunately, it was cold and bland. We kindly sent it back. The server brought a fresh batch a few minutes later as compliments from the chef. Still, there was something lacking. The veggies were a bit soggy and the flavor was lacking but at least it was warm. For the entree I ordered the salmon that came with baked potato and broccolini. I imagined a baked potato for some reason but it was 3 tiny slivers of sliced potato that I guess were baked. The broccolini was really tasty, as was the tiny bit of potato. The salmon had good flavor at first bite, a bit over cooked. I was never asked how I wanted the salmon cooked. I am usually asked in restaurants how I would like the salmon. So overall the flavor of the dish was great until I started biting into salmon pin bones. I found one and kept eating thinking it was just one that was missed but ended up finding 5 pin bones. I didn't feel comfortable eating the salmon at the point. The server asked if everything was okay and we informed her and showed her what happened. I've never had so many pin bones, if any, while ordering filleted salmon at a restaurant. She asked if maybe we wanted the branzino and I said it was okay. A few minutes later she brought garlic shrimp from the chef. I'm not a big shrimp fan but still tried it and it has good flavor. The music started at 7pm and there were two talented musicians, singing and playing guitar. A nice show and refreshing to see in Miami. Overall, the restaurant is beautiful and has a lot of potential. The wine/beer list could use an improvement as could some of the dishes. My mom enjoyed her steak dish, the only complaint was how small the portion was for her, which I felt with my sides for the salmon dish. Staff is mostly nice. I know we had a few mishaps so that never helps with service but our server was mostly kind, she seemed a bit annoyed at times. Again, can't blame her but we also did not enjoy having to send back two dishes. I look forward to the development of the restaurant and appreciate the chef's attempt by sending the dishes to try.",
      "Beautiful Dining Experience. You can feel the love the moment you walk through the door. From the kind hostess, the buss boy and our great server Burcu. I am Vegan and considering there are not a lot vegan options on the menu what was available for me was just perfect and amazing. The Tabouli Salad was the best I have ever had., the hummus!! Wow! The tea was delicious! Will definitely be back. Much love and success.",
      "It's always great seeing an old favorite location come back to life with a new energy, a new vibe! So is the case with the old location of The District, reborn as Jass Kitchen! With its live jazz music on the weekend (a great play on the owner's name) there's a great spot for Turkish and Mediterranean food in the Wynwood / Design District area.. I saw the work on the renovation driving by a few months back, and am glad it finally opened. Coming from the full moon party, I was in casual wear and was still welcomed to eat inside. Jasmine and her staff were very attentive and pleasant. Although I didn't get a response first in calling the restaurant, Jasmine did call back and assured me that even though it was near closing time they would still welcome me. I appreciate that level of dedicated service!They have a variety of warm and cold mezze, which I started with the hummus and stuffed grape leaves. The grape leaves had a delicious citrusy tang, garnished with a lemon and packed with other tasty yums. Similarly, i also enjoyed the hummus with its subtle blend of spices. Medium well as I requested, the skirt steak was a generous portion of juicy and aromatic cuts.Crispy brocoolini spears and a handful of baked potato pieces rounded out the flavor. Although they didn't have moscato, their attentive and friendly bartender helped me to select a perfectly light rose. Coupled with the fluffy crispy peanut butter base Anatolian Pavlova and its filling with cream and fresh fruit, it makes for a great closing.",
      "Omg This place is incredible! They have  Live jazz music  thursdays Friday Saturdays. We has a trio of cold appetizers Mix Trio Mezze of Muammara, Eggplant Salad, Beet Pink dip. It came with pita to dip and was so good!.The lamb chops were great, but the Branzino was my favorite. It was so soft, almost creamy, and had roasted tomatoes that were so sweetWe had three desserts. My fav was the baklava, but the other was phenomenal as well. I am going back next week I love it so much",
      "Divine.. Everything I ordered was delicious and fresh, the ambiance is beautiful. The (waitress/actually maybe she's the owner) was kind and seemed like a genuinely great person. The male waiter kept looking at me,it was kinda awkward and uncomfortable, lol. I ordered the steak dinner and the Tzatziki. The steak is soooo tender and perfectly seasoned. The potato's could use a bit more flavor so I just dipped them in my ziki. The ziki sauce was some of the best I've ever had and they serve it with what I think is housemade bread. The bread is the best bread ever, it's soooo good. Next time I will order more. They also have a in house spicy sauce that's delicious. I definitely will be back the food was just too good and affordable with great portions. I've already referred a online buddy to dine here on her vacation.",
      "Wow wow wow. I had high expectations for this place based on other reviews and wow they were met. The ambiance of the restaurant is awesome, very cute spot with live jazz music. Definitely a great spot for a date night. We had 4 people at our table and we struggled on what to order, so we ended up over ordering but I'm so happy we got to taste so many things (& everything is very well priced)We got the trio mezze appetizer which is cool because you can pick any 3 dishes you want. We went with the tzatziki, red pepper dip and eggplant dip. It also came with warm pita. They were all amazing but the red pepper was my favorite. We also got the zucchini pancake and green salad. For entrees we all split the lamb chop, steak, branzino and clay lamb. All delicious but my favorite was the steak (the chimichurri was to die for). My fiancés favorite was the lamb chop, he wished he didn't have to share it lol. I can't wait to come back!"

      "Parcela is the most adorably delicious cafe in Little Havana.First of all, it's oozing in ambiente. There are plants, there are comfy chairs, there are couches, there is tropical wall paper. Essentially, I wish whoever designed this would come to my apartment and give it a revamp.Second of all - the menu is delicious. Chef Perse P is preparing some really satisfying fare that tastes as good as it looks. It's got some twists on Little Havana Classics and also some unexpected veggie forward hits.I've visited for lunch twice so far. On my first visit I enjoyed a delicious salad along with hummus topped with sofrito. *drools*Last week I enjoyed a Pan con Bistec. It is served on the most airy of breads and features my fave - churrasco. Not to be slept on is their coffee game. They use counter culture here, as well as a locally made almond milk if plant milk is your thing. It happens to be mine, and I will most definitely find myself there more often. Shout out to Nicole for making my latte dreams come true!This is the kind of place you can find yourself sitting and enjoying great food and great conversation.They have wifi, and a nice community space to post up and catch up on some emails or just enjoy the people watching that comes from sitting in the lobby of a hotel.The best part of all of this (besides their wonderful chef and staff) - parking is freeeeeeeee!",

Great improvement Solid burger spot right on coral way super nice outdoor seating will definitely take advantage of that once it gets a bit cooler in Miami but great vibe my only recommendation is that instead of going to the tables with the device have a check book right down there order and than type it in looks super unprofessional having it at the table I work in the industry it's just a recommendation but over all definitely will be back ! Craving another burger now actually !",

      "Juanchis burger is legit!I wanted to try this place for a while now so since I was in the are but early...  decided to wait 'till they open and try it.What a great decision that was. So i got there 11.30 maybe ... and they would open at noon. 30 minutes later .... I'm it.Waiter recommended home run burger which I said.. why not. Medium rare please!.The seasoning in the patty itself is so good. Very flavourful. You can actually taste the beef and that is important. The bread hold the burger and all ingredients perfectly including sauces... some burgers fall apart but this bun was good, fluffy and sturdy at the same time.Also, ordered the truffle French fries which are shoe string fries cut extra thin and are not grease at all. Very crispy in fact. Light truffle flavor and nicely seasoned. Now.... what is wrong with regular ketchup these days.... I mean, I like sauces and all...  but regular ketchup for fries... can't beat that. Anyway,  if you want ketchup you will probably have to ask for it.Great place, awesome burger and great service and staff.",

      "I have been trying to make it to Caja Caliente for some time after following Chef Mika Leon.  Her creations have made me salivate for quite some time and I was dying to try the restaurant first hand.Well, I can't wait to go back and try some more! Or... repeat some spectacular items. We ordered the \"bolas de plátano rellenas de picadillo\" and the \"bolas de yucca rellenas de picadillo\" my favorite was the plantain bolas but they were both delicious and paired beautifully with the sauce! We also ordered the tamal cubano. This was a cool dish as I have had tamales before, but not quite like this. This was plated as best case scenario of toppings a Cuban would put on their beautifully seasoned tamal. And, well we cleaned the plate because it was also delicious !I couldn't leave without trying the famous tacos! They were loaded and full of flavor!! We tried the octopus, the vaca frita, and the lechón taco. All had their shine and jam packed with flavor! Lastly, our server recommended that we try the fish. And well since we had been so pleased with the food so far... I said Dale !  The fish was fried to perfection, crispy, and with a beautiful adobo. This was plated with a side of moros and plantains (also delicious). Overall wonderful experience ! I will be back ! Thank you for sharing your family's recipes with us and giving us a chance to eat these delicious Cuban creations executed beautifully! Thank you Chef Mika !",
      "Love  coming to Caja Caliente !!This place has that delicious MOM & POP feel because all of the food is delicious. I decided to go for Brunch and ordered the Disco Volador which means Flying Saucer  in Spanish. They were very popular in Cuba and the tradition has now flown to Coral Gables. Then I split the pancake portion with my date. So if you are near Ponce de Leon & sw 8 st ,make sure you stop by and taste all their goodie available.",
      "Let me start off by saying that this place is not a food truck. It's an actual restaurant. I don't know why the Yelp says Food Truck. I came here on a Friday night near closing and I was hesitant because when I walked in it was empty but I stayed and I am glad I did. The waitress was very kind and gave me some recommendations. I decided to go with their most known item- tacos. I ordered a vaca frita taco and an order of the spicy goat cheese croquetas.  The croquetas were delicious! The mixture inside was so cheesy and savory and the dipping sauce was the perfect kick. I am a huge fan of cheese croquetas and this one hit the spot. Then came my taco. The taco was pretty big and had so much vaca frita. The taco for me was the best. The vaca frita was so tender and flavorful and the cebollas were tangy. I came back the next day and tried the arroz con pollo and the vaca frita burrito and oh my god! The arroz con pollo tasted like home. This place is delicious!",
      "Food was okay. Everyone had something different and most of it was hit or miss. Service left much to be desired. Our server seemed annoyed to have to wait on us - not sure what that was about. Maybe homie was having a bad day, but it was kind of a bummer.",
      "Absolutely fantastic. Stopped in for an early dinner and found an adorable restaurant and an incredibly friendly server. Liannys was very attentive and helped make suggestions that were ultimately fantastic, even helping us navigate the difference between a La Reina vs a Jai Alai. The bolas de yuca rellanas con picadillo came with a delicious cilantro-based sauce and were absolutely delicious. The Cuban tamal was massive and beautifully plated, and somehow even more delicious than the first dish. We also tried an empanada de pastelon - unsurprisingly delicious. Finally, we finished with a disco volador with guayaba and queso crema, as Liannys recommended. We were far from disappointed. Truly a tasty dessert!Between the food and Liannys, this place is magical. Do not miss it.",
      "So delicious. Mika has an awesome menu that reminds us of our childhood. The disco voladores are majorly addictive!!",
      "Fabulous food and service.  I had the vaca frita burrito. To. Die for. Huge portion so I'm bringing half home. My friend had fish tacos and ate all of them. We ordered the spicy goat cheese croquetas. Not very spicy, but yummy.  Margarita not too sweet. Cortadito is perfect. Flan is as good as my mom's.  What else can I say?",
      "Delicious spot for lunch! I ordered the mahi mahi taco and beef empanadas. Both were winners! Mahi mahi was a generous portion and well seasoned. The other components of the taco were also flavorful and would have satisfied any vegetarian I like to just have the veggies. Beef empanadas were stuffed full of flavorful beef and the outside was perfect!  The staff working were also very nice and made the experience that much more enjoyable.",
      "I can't believe I've been living so close to this spot and never dropped in. I love that you don't see it when you turn on Ponce- and it's the perfect hole in the wall. We started off with their empanadas, they bring a few small ones which are perfect to start. I ordered the ahi tuna poke bowl that was so good! I wish I would have put the sauce on the side cus it was a little much after a while (so that's my first tip). The shrimp and steak tacos were perfection. Definitely quality meat. The sauce on those does have mayo - so if you're not a fan of mayonnaise, make sure to order without it. One taco is pretty filling, two will have you really full. Then I ordered the flan de coco- the owners know what they're doing. I LOVE flan, this was hands down the best I have ever tried. Overall, great food, great atmosphere. Will come back on my next cheat day :)!",
      "Amazing food. Great service! Honestly, this plate didn't disappoints. I thought I selected a less tastier plate because everything else sounded and looked amazing but I was going for healthy and delish and this plate was everything that I ate every bit of quinoa rice with the steak because it was so tasty. Highly recommend it."

      "Visited multiple times and always a great time with a beautiful view! The service is always top notch and my server Aloni was very kind on my last visit. The food and drinks are very good with my personal favorites being the nachos and a frozen strawberry daiquiri after a long day at the beach.",
      "First off, I just want to highlight how amazing the food and drinks were. But, really the reason I'm leaving this review is because of how absolutely kind and accommodating the manager, Joseph was. I've never left a review for any restaurant, i've never cared or felt the need to. But, Joe made our experience so unforgettable. We arrived around 6pm and ended up staying until they closed at 9pm because we were enjoying ourselves so much. I work as a recruiter/brand manager for a notable restaurant group in Detroit and one aspect of my job is responding to reviews, such as yelp reviews like these. So, I fully know and understood every type of review you can get. That's why I felt so compelled to leave this review. We sat at a table a little bit away from others dining, which is what we wanted, since most places in Miami are loud and busy. We wanted something quiet and quaint. Joseph came over to greet us and from there sparked a wonderful conversation between he, my mom, and I. We talked for a majority of our dining experience (which i loved), we learned so much about him, he learned so much about us. We had a wonderful conversation between the 3 of us, during our experience. He also brought out the Chef, who was so wonderfully nice, for us to meet, which was so cool and something i've never experienced before. I loved that I was able to thank and tell the Chef himself how amazing the food was. We got to converse with him as well and learn a lot about him. All and all the experience was so wonderful. The staff was so kind, the food was amazing, the drinks were amazing, and the atmosphere was amazing. Everyone should dine here! We had the best time and both my mom and myself said it was the best dining experience out of all the places we've tried in Miami. Thank you so much to Joseph and to the staff at Whiskey Joe's. We can't wait to come back the next time we visit Miami!",
      "Great view but there's so much more.  Our server Jonathan was simply excellent.  It's like he was reading my mind.  The mussels app was delicious. As was my grouper sandwich.  The burger was tasty but not exceptional.  Very pleased.",
      "We went to Key Biscayne to spend the day at the beach. Once we arrived we saw how dirty the water looked and all the seaweed floating around so we decided not to get in the water. After realizing swimming wasn't in the cards for us, we thought we get something to eat since it was lunchtime. I first looked at the menu online to see if it's the type of place we wanted to eat and decided it was. They offer a variety of options, something for everyone. They had a nice cocktail menu as well. We parked outside in the parking lot with no issues or fees. The staff was ok but has a lot of room to improve. There were several (4-5) people behind the bar area, where you place your order but none seemed to enthusiastic about helping you. I found it a little strange that you had to place your order at the bar, no wait staff comes to your table. When our food came, we asked about eating utensils, and the waitress mumbled and nodded her head towards the bar.We finally figured that she wasn't going to hebring us any utensils so we walked over to the bar where they had some. That was a little annoying. Not the best service. I ordered chips and guacamole and a pulled pork sandwich. Everything was just okay.  They have an indoor area bar as well but that seemed dead. The best thing about this place is the location and view. Not the worst experience but there's nothing making me want to go back...maybe to have a few drinks but nothing more.",
      "It was the perfect place to watch all of the games this afternoon. (Well, minus the Houston Texans game)Our service by the bartender Luz was fabulous and friendly. The icing on the cake was when Chef Jaq came out to check on us. His food was fantastic! Besides, it was fabulous to come in from the beach and enjoy the World Cup in a relaxed atmosphere that was laid back and fun.",
      "I was recently at Whiskey Joe's and enjoyed the atmosphere and service. the British gentleman was especially helpful and kind .",
      "Terrible service and terrible drinks. Not returningNever saw manager to help and bartenders were rude when i finally got service at bar. I waited long time and then they would go to others randomly,Unorganized, slow and rude.",
      "The good:The atmosphere and proximity to the water gives this place an additional star. There's a lot of indoor and outdoor seating options. The outdoor space overlooks the marina so it's scenic and breezy. I tried the fish nuggets, key lime pie and rum runner cocktail for my husband's birthday. I liked the sauce underneath the pie and I enjoyed the tart flavor and smoothness of the pie filling. The music was bumping and the atmosphere was very party-esque when I came on a Friday afternoon. The bad:The mahi nuggets were all random sizes with some of them being tiny. Some pieces were more batter than fish and it had the appearance of leftover crisps from a fry basket. It was over cooked. The sweet and sour sauce tasted like the packaged or store-bought kind. The key lime pie crust was soggy. The interesting:When we came, you had to order and pay ahead at the bar (even for food). You get a table number and then seat yourself.",
      "Amé la vista, una de las más hermosas que obtendrás en Miami del downtown y la bahía, porque estás casi sentado en el agua, lo cual tiene como beneficio el poder despejar la mente con el sonido del mar y la vista con las luces a lo lejos que iluminan la ciudad, pero el olor no es el más agradable :(No obstante vale la pena muchísimo ir a tomarse un trago y comer del menú americano que ofrecen. Para alguien que esté visitando MIA o de paso por poquito tiempo este restaurante es un tiro certero para llevarse la imagen del paisaje que conforman los edificios en Brickell vistos del otro lado del puente de Key Biscayne. También para una cita romántica puede funcionar o para quedar con los amigos y conversar un rato lejos del tráfico y el bullicio que hay cruzando el mar. Vayan aquí al menos una vez, que no hay otro lugar así en un gran diámetro...",
      "I have been to Whiskey Joe's more times than I would like to ever admit to. Whiskey Joe's is the perfect place to go after a day of paddling, with a beautiful view of Virginia Key and the outline of Brickell in a distance. A casual ambiance with a covered outside patio, and on warm days, there is always a gentle breeze to keep you cool. Add to that scenery and cold glass of cold beer and good food, and you may end up spending more hours there than you had anticipated. The only drawback is that, depending on who is working, the service can be slow at times. If I am thirsty, I often go to the bar and get my first drink because I never know how long the service may be. But with that first glass of beer, the waiting doesn't feel that bad.",
      "While staying in Miami, we thought this spot sounded cool and went there to have a few drinks. The view of Miami and the water is very pretty and you can watch the people working at the marina taking boats out of the water which I thought was cool. Our server was friendly. I had a couple of beers and then tried their margarita which was tasty. My boyfriend tried a watermelon margarita and enjoyed it. We also shared an order of gator bites and they were really good as well. The only odd thing is our server kind of suddenly cashed us out when we weren't really planning on leaving right away and hadn't mentioned leaving. I know sometimes their shift may be over and I'm fine with cashing out with them before transferring to someone else, but she didn't make a mention of this nor did someone else come and check on us after so we ended up leaving after we finished our drinks. I'm sure if I'd asked, someone would have reopened a tab so it wasn't a huge deal, just odd in my opinion. Overall, it's a nice spot to relax on the patio and have some drinks or food while enjoying the lovely view."

      "10/10 I come here quite often and it's one of my favorites! I love it here. The place is such small, quaint, and such a vibe. The sandwiches here are THE BOMB. They stuff them with  lots of meats and are really just so good. Everything is made fresh and in house. If you are a fan of lemonade you have got to try theirs. It doesn't not disappoint. The cróquetas are also some of my favorites in Miami. This spot is perfect for lunch, it's filing and delicious. Try Tinta y Cafe you won't regret it",
      "Hubby and I stopped by Tinta y Café for a quick breakfast while in Miami for the weekend. I hopped out and placed our order, hubby waited to park. Their lot isn't too big but he only waited a few minutes for a spot.Our order was ready within 15 minutes or so. We got lucky and snagged a table on their patio.The cafe con leche was sweet and delicious. Just like my abuela makes it! We ordered 2 different breakfast sandwiches to share - 1. Seared ham, egg, Swiss cheese and guava preserves - my favorite! The seared ham was very good. Guava preserves on this sandwich is a must! It really adds an extra layer of deliciousness and pairs well with the seared ham.2. Bacon, egg, mozzarella cheese and guava preserves - also very good. The bacon was cooked well. Yummy, toasty media noche bread.I would for sure return for breakfast if in the area again!",
      "This little cafe is the cutest neighborhood spot. It's a family run restaurant and it feels like it too! Everyone is super sweet and friendly. But what about the food? Incredible. The sandwiches are so delicious! My favorite is La Carlena. It has this amazing cilantro mayo sauce that tastes amazing. Great breakfast and lunch spot. The coffee is spectacular ! And the croqueticas too!!!",
      "If you've never had the perfect sandwich, hurry and head to Tinta y Cafe to get your Callejero sandwich. This cute little spot in Coral Gables has a ventanita where you can get your favorite coffee on the go, the best croquetas, empanadas, and chose from a variety of delicious sandwiches!",
      "This place is just amazing. The Madurito has maduro in the sandwich giving it a sweet tone to a salty classic. The guajira is one of my personal favorites here. It can be in pork or chicken but I always opt for chicken. A flavorful mojo marinated chicken with thin delicious onions and gooey cheese. I can write a review just on that sandwich forever. The croquetas are like no other. A tinta croqueta is iconic and known by almost anyone any time it makes a cameo. The Jamon one is the way to go (if you want the classic route). If you're in Miami and haven't been here (why not tho) give this spot a try. You're going to love it instantly!",
      "This is where the cool kids and Miami plastic surgery people go to eat traditional and reinvented Cuban sandwiches and coffee. Cute space with indoor and outdoor seating. Some parking with off street parking as well. I tried the egg, ham and cheese with blueberry jam. Reminded me of a montecristo sandwich but it had a little too much butter. Will be back  when I'm in the area.",
      "It was my first time trying a Cuban sandwich. I was originally going to try Sanguish but it was wayyy too packed, so I found this spot and I'm so glad I did!! There wasn't a line when I went. I got the Cuban sandwich & it was so delicious I want to fly back to Miami to eat another one with their coffee",
      "Absolutely delicious! Dare I say one of the best Cuban sandwiches I've had in a while! I ordered the El Patria, basically the traditional Cuban. Perfectly put together, juicy, fresh and savory. They have a little window you can order from for to-go service. Otherwise you can wait to sit inside. Cute little area to sit in the outside if you want to do the Togo. Overall I highly recommend to come here!",
      "The most delicious breakfast sandwich! Super cute spot on Ponce De Leon in Gables. They have a window in case you wish to order on the go. Once you enter there's a few tables to sit and a bar like area where you can watch your food being made. They seem to get pretty busy, we got there a little after 9AM and finishing up a wave of people came in after. I also tried their dirty chai latte with oatmilk, unfortunately I finished it before taking a pic! Next time, because I'm sure to be back!",
      "Tinta y Cafe is an absolute treasure where you really can't go wrong. The rave reviews do not lie.Delicious sandwiches are always guaranteed. Their bread alone is top notch.Freshly fried delicious croquetas also guaranteed. Pro tip: Do not sleep on the spinach croquetas.As a croissant aficionado, I am sincerely impressed with their plain croissant.Fresh squeezed OJ should always have the pulp and I really appreciate that they get that."

      "I don't know anything about the food here. Just the drinks and they're alright. My friends and I stumbled into the patio area of this restaurant one night during Art Basel after we weren't able to get into a party we waited in line for an hour for. The DJ was really doing his thing playing a mix of Caribbean music and afro beats that we could dance to. The vibes were immaculate all around. Truly an underrated spot. Hundreds of other people were standing in line at bars all up and through Wynwood and we made this place our party.",
      "The service at Nostimo is friendly and what you'd hope for at any restaurant. However, the food did not exactly live up to the hype of these amazing reviews. The food was not bad, but definitely could have been better. We ordered a platter, green salad, and loaded Greek fries. The fries were plain and we were not told about them no longer making the loaded fries until they showed up at the table. The chicken was a bit dry and the rice had very little flavor. We did enjoy the tzatziki was tasty, as was the Greek salad, although I would have preferred a bit more dressing. Atmosphere was lively and open air to party central out front. Parking was no issue on a busy night.",
      "Server was kind and sweet.  Generous portion and decent quality food.  It was a Friday night and the dinning room was pretty empty.I don't have comparison in Miami as this is the only Greek restaurant we tried but it's not as good as where we used to live in LA, CA.  Probably won't go back for a second meal but if you are craving for mediterranean and didn't want to pay $30 a plate, you will want to check out this place.",
      "The type of place that doesnt give you a printed check, automatically adds an 18% gratuity and STILL shows you a screen to add 15/18/20%. Of course, the waiter didn't disclose the 18% was already included. We have to start getting rid of this tomfoolery in Miami.Casual place. Good food.",
      "I was pleasantly surprised by this place. I must say when you walk in, it doesn't look like a Greek restaurant at all honestly. More like a sports bar. The reviews were good, and it was one of the only spots open in wynwood at 2 in morning so we gave it a go. Their prices were decent too. It wasn't until the food arrive that I realized we really got a bang for our buck. Portions were huge! And honestly, the food was so satisfying. All of it was flavorful: falafel was fluffy and fresh, rice was perfectly cooked, even the salad was delicious. It might of been a little on the salty side for some people but I personally tend to like things on the salty side. I would say to skip the baklava though! Dry and stale. The Nutella somewhat saved it. For 2 am in wynwood, this meal certainly exceeded my expectations. Will be back.",
      "I am giving this bad rating due to their forced regulations. I had ordered a to go pick up order. Upon pick up I was asked to pay and when I reviewed the receipt in full I noticed they were charging an 18% gratuity. It was not pointed out to me but I actually had to read to notice this. I questioned It since I was not receiving any table service, I simply ordered a to go order. I was shocked then when they told me It was mandatory to pay It. 1 -Since when is a tip mandatory?  Table service or not. Customers have a right to change It. 2 - since when is a 18% tip mandatory on a \"take away order\" with no table service. If they did not have this I would have given It 4.5 stars for their gyros and lamb souvlaki. But I have to give the worst rating possible since I feel like I was just scammed out of being forced to pay their employee wages. I normally do tip for take away, but not based on percentage like a server would be.  I travel all over the world. And lived in Miami all my life. Never have I experienced such a thing. This is just plainly insulting that a restaurant in the city I am from is doing this and getting away with It.",
      "Best gyros in Miami!! I don't write many reviews but had to for this place. Every time I eat here it never disappoints. Whatever you order, I promise you'll love. I've had their gyros, souvlaki, Greek salad, and dolmas. All were excellent. Not only is the food delicious, but the service is great. You can tell that they put an emphasis on customer service and ensuring that customers leave happy. That's really important to me as a customer and is one of the many reasons why I keep coming back.",
      "When you need a quick Mediterranean  fix this is the place to order from. But stick to the gyros which are actually really good. This was my second time ordering from here and decided to go with the bowl. Upon arrival my plate was extremely heavy upon opening it, there was already 5 pounds of tzatziki over my lamb over rice and salad. I literally had to scoop out the sauce, I think it was enough for a family of 20 (not exaggerating) I think they should be considerate and maybe put it on the side. I hate when there's no love put into a dish.",
      "Look no further than Nostimo for delicious, authentic and affordable green food in wynwood! we went all out in our last visit and had the lamb platter with rice, the Greek salad, falafel and homemade baklava for dessert. Very single plate was absolute perfection! so yummy and with ingredients perfectly paired together. The falafel were soooo full of flavor! Make sure to save room for dessert--- the baklava is TO DIE FOR! Highly recommend.",
      "For the price this place could use much improvements! I ordered the shrimp salad and got what appeared to be small shrimp appetizer for $20! Whereas my coworker got a massive chicken gyro for $13! Ingredients did not taste fresh but overall the food was edible. Would not return but if your feeling a Gyro on a budget this is your spot for lunch!"

      "Amazing steakhouse Our favorite was the the Australian Wagyu which I can only say was perfection. their sides were so perfectly complimentary. Truffle Mac and cheese, the Brussels sprouts, spinach, broccolini and cauliflower were excellent. Beef lettuce wraps were decent, beet salad was good, kids meals were devoured. ALSO if you're here for breakfast their buffet is great",
      "WOW - To say I was completely blown away by my first time dining here would be an understatement. Whether you're celebrating a special occasion or just craving a delectable meal that will leave you speechless, this is the spot that will be sure to leave a lasting impression. From the lavish and trendy decor, the out of this world dishes, beautiful presentations and impeccable service, every detail was taken well into consideration and perfected.I can say with certainty that this is one of the most gorgeous spaces I've ever eaten a meal in. The sultry vibe, elegantly designed interior, endless display of wine bottles scattered throughout the restaurant and the stunning bar will have you feeling like you're in the midst of dining amongst celebrities. There didn't seem to be a bad table to dine at in sight, but my parents and I were lucky enough to snag one of the beautiful half-moon booths toward the center of the room. When is the last time you've been to a restaurant that brings complimentary French fries to the table? And not just any regular ole' French fries, but a delicious trio of French fries each complimented by their own unique dipping sauce? Bet it's probably never happened before, unless you've eaten here. I thought this was such a neat but simple touch that really set them apart from other high-end restaurants. They also bring yummy rolls topped with sea salt to the table (between the fries & the bread, you might end up in a food coma before you even order if you're not careful). I ordered the tuna tartar for an appetizer and I was in heaven every time I took a bite. Not only does it melt in your mouth, but the presentation alone is enough reason to order this (the way they mix it for you makes for a fun video opportunity if you have your phone ready to record). My parents shared a shrimp cocktail that they both enjoyed - The shrimp were massive! Following the appetizers, I munched on a cesar salad which was perfectly dressed. Now... the STEAK. Holy moly, one of the best filet mignons I have had yet. It was ridiculously flavorful, tender & juicy. Melted in your mouth and bursted with flavor. If you're a steak lover, it would be a crime to come here and not order it. The mashed potatoes that accompanied it were also flavorful, but I thought they were a little too runny (my only complaint of the whole meal). If you're a fan of grilled onions, do yourself a favor and order a side of these to top your steak with and thank me later. The \"Smoked Chocolate S'mores\" dessert was ridiculously decadent and was the perfect finish to an impeccable meal. Yes, it's insanely pricy and yes, it's totally worth it. My experience here was one of the best dining experiences I've ever had in Miami - And that says a lot given the fact that Miami is one of the hottest spots in the country for foodies. This restaurant hit it out the park for me and I'm already searching for an excuse to go back to South Florida and to savor new dishes on their menu.",
      "The restaurant is spacious and nice. Bar is nice as well.Staff was friendly and attentive.For appetizers the tuna tartare was fresh and seasoned well.They also bring you French fries 3 different ways with 3 different sauces. I had the certified Angus rib cap cooked medium rare and It was good and flavorful. The side of Mac and Cheese was good as well.",
      "Our favorite was the the Australian Wagyu which I can only say was perfection.",
      "Ambiance was awesome. The dishes, coctails and the dessert were so delicious. All the employees were so polite and friendly. They celebrated our honeymoon with a cute card, it was so nice.They made our special day unforgettable.",
      "Wonderful experience! Fabulous service. Timing, everything was a 10.  Our server really made our night fabulous, she was awesome. Great steak, Mac and cheese with truffle was really nice. Molten cake was super good as well. I must say everything was impeccable.",
      "Phenomenal cuisine. Never have a enjoyed such a succulent and flavourful sea bass - it is one of their renowned specials. But the lack of bones in the fish was made up for by the pained bones in my rear.The decor was beautiful but very far from comfortable. The low chairs were too uncomfortable for eating. The benches; built for slaves.The overall experience was truly hampered by a god awful designer deserving of life in prison for her domestic terror on comfort. 4/5 not bad",
      "This plus is amazing! We had a private room & our server was Erin. Erin was very pleasant, patient, informative & very professional. She suggested several appetizers & dinner. It was our first time visiting this restaurant & it definitely won't be our last.",
      "Food was incredible. I love that when you get to the table instead of getting some bread you get french fries. Service was also impeccable and ambiance is very family friendly in my opinion"

If you don't right you can catch the live music as the sun sets, and the restaurant transforms to a lounge. Totally worth coming Parking is tricky, and if you're not paying attention you might miss it as you drive by. But it's a gem worth coming back to.",
      "Seaspice is known to Miami locals as a very high end resturant, frequented by celebrities.  I have no idea why.  The service is pretty awful.  The drink runners are horrible.  It takes about 30 minutes for just a drink to be brought out to you.  The food is mediocre.  It is definitely NOT worth the price, which is very expensive.  I am giving two stars because the view is amazing.  Seaspice is right on the water and has a gorgeous ambiance.  You can watch yachts drive by and some will even pull up and park.  The other star is for the tres leches.  This dessert was AMAZING, I would go back just to eat it again.  But otherwise, Seaspice is nothing special.  Save your money.",
      "A place that tries to be high end but fails to deliver.Service ? Mediocre Food ? Below parFirst thing when you check in is they tell you that you have a 2 hr max(tacky)",
      "I read this was one of the best patio dining AND a hot spot for celebrities in Miami, so I had to go check it out on our recent travels to this area...Initially I was worried about our luggage situation, as we had to carry our luggage to the restaurant since this was our last stop in Miami. However, they were very accommodating, and let us store some of our stuff in the closet, and we kept the big luggage with us, near our table.As expected, the patio scene was spectacular...city skyline and seaside views, with plenty of yachts passing by! The place indeed had that chic celebrity vibe...truly FAB! Loved the music overhead as well. Somehow, I expected some snobbiness...but not at all. Service was great!Then the food. OMFG...I've had some amazing foods lately, but this takes the cake. Even the complimentary bread was amazing (and unique)! My husband ordered this Wagyu Burger, and I chose this Ragu Pappardelle ( THE best Ragu Pappardelle I've ever had...EVER. ). Then this Pavola dessert...again, just beyond delish. Truly, this was foods for the celebrities.Honestly, I'm shocked at how low the rating is for this place. I assume that if the service isn't top notch, it would probably piss some folks off. The pricing was on the outlandish side...with even lunch entrees starting at around 40. There was even an appetizer item priced at around 70 bucks! Luckily, like I said, I felt that the foods and the service (and especially the spectacular ambiance) made up for it. There was this big yacht parked right near us, which somewhat blocked some of the views from the left. Still, we got our eyeful of seaside/yachtside views.In any case, this was a great way to end our trip in Miami.",
      "Went here with a group of girlfriends for brunch and everything was delicious, they were super accommodating as well.I had the froze , a cucumber and gin cocktail and 2 grey goose and sodas and all were fantastic.As a table we split the fresh fish and a couple sides and it was delicious. Also love the free bread It is definitely on the pricier side overall tbh but great for a fun \"fancy\" brunch",
      "Came here for Miami spice and although we spent more than we thought we would, we had a good time. Everything was delicious. The kale Caesar had pecans and Granny Smith apple slices, never had a Caesar like this but it was a nice change! The Shrimp Pesto Whole Wheat Spaghetti was my favorite, even though I'm not the biggest fan of pesto. The burger was good too just a little messy from the truffle aioli. The chocolate cremoso and tres leches was very good but I'd go with the cremoso for the cocoa nib crumble, yum! All in all, I think it's overpriced and I probably won't come here again because of that. The cheapest bottle of Chardonnay was $75 and most drinks were $20. I only came here for Miami spice and still spent almost $200.",
      "Given we still have Miami Spice going on until the end of the month we decided to try out the lunch menu @ Seaspice gorgeous location on the Miami River, sitting outdoor is really relaxing, so beautiful to watch the boats go by, really lovely To start we had the Comte' Cheese Soufflé, I have to admit this was a bit disappointing, it really did not have the texture of a real soufflé  but then............ the Shrimp Pesto Whole Wheat Spaghetti and the Pan-Seared Chilean Seabass were really good as dessert, both the Tres Leches and the Chocolate Cremoso were yummy Try it out before Miami Spice ends, you can check out the Miami Spice Menus on miamiandthebeaches.com@seaspicemia",
      "First time for me at Seaspice, it is located on the banks of the Miami River it is a gem that you should not miss. Sit outside in the courtyard enjoy your food and a drinks while watching the boats go by, just beautiful We had the Miami Spice lunch which has a very affordable fix price 3 course menu for $ 28, unfortunately this will end soon, nevertheless, I would defiantly go back again for sureRegarding the Miami Spice menu only one observation, they should have had more than one choice for the Entrees without the extra charge, right now you have 4 choices and 3 of these have extra charge on it, not really fair given that you are promoting the Spice menu, you should have at least two or three choices included in the price and one or two with the extra charge We had had Prince Edward Island Mussels, Grilled, the Grilled Faroe Island Salmon and the Profiteroles and Peaches and Cream. My favorite where the Mussels, the garlic pizza bread they brought for the table was absolutely delicious, the Salmon was good too. I had the Peaches for dessert and it was ok, not really my thing, my friend said the Profiteroles were great, next time I will not opt for the healthy dessert We enjoyed all with a good Albariño wine, our experience was made especially enjoyable by our waiter Fabrizio, he was really great ! Thank you Fabrizio @seaspicemia",
      "Bad first impression. Its not a nice feeling to feel like you have to beg to spend your money at a restaurant. Every year I look forward to Miami Spice. It's a great way to try out various restaurants and a unique spread of menu options. Seaspice was on my radar and happened to be one of the participating restaurants offering the Miami Spice menu. I contacted the restaurant in advance and made a reservation for 3:30p for a party of four. My mom who is from out of town was excited to join us for lunch. I advised the restaurant we were doing the Miami Spice menu. The restaurant made it clear that they charge $50pp for No Shows. At 3:15pm, we arrived for our reservation. The hostess Karin greeted us, and advised us that they were running behind on the reservations and because of this they will not be able to offer the Miami Spice menu. Only the a la-carte menu will be offered. This was a bit upsetting because we drove almost an hour to get there and the restaurant is refusing to offer the Miami Spice promotion. Our natural instinct was to just say forget it we will go somewhere else. I mean, at the end of the day who wants to beg to spend their money? It's absurd. If the restaurant is offering a promotional menu and because to no fault of our own they are running behind why should we be penalized?My Mom looked so bummed out. Because she was so excited to try this place. I decided to walk back in and ask for a Manager. The Manager took 20min to come out. When he finally did come over, he introduced himself as Collin. I explained to him what was going on and it seemed as though he wasn't aware that the hostesses were turning Miami Spice customers away. He decided to make it right and advised Karin to honor the Miami Spice menu. Impressive! Things were turning around. Besides the encounter at the hostess stand, the restaurant is beautiful. It is situated on Miami's waterfront were you can view the million dollar yachts passing by. They also have docks for those interested in docking and dining. You can view the downtown city skyline which I am sure looks amazing at night.The food was excellent. The Miami Spice menu offered a three course lunch for $28. You have the choice of a starter (Kale Salad, Cheese Souffle, or White Gazpacho). A choice of entrees (Seabass, Chicken Breast, Shrimp Pesto Pasta, Wagyu Burger, or Plant Bowl). And a choice of dessert (Tres Leches or Chocolate Cremoso). They also offer the option to add a Glass of wine for and additional $12. I ordered the Comte Cheese Souffle, the Green Circle Farms Chicken Breast, and the Tres Leches. The others in my party ordered the Kale Salad, Gazpacho, and Seabass. For starters, My favorites were the Kale Caesar Salad and Cheese Souffle. The Kale Caesar had a mix of shredded Granny Smith apples, pecans and a creamy Caesar dressing. The cheese Souffle was like a fluffy egg Souffle with a cream parmesan sauce and tomato chutney. Delicious!For entrees, both the Seabass and Chicken breast were amazing. The Chicken breast was tender and juicy, served on top of a creamy polenta and topped with corn, peas, and mushrooms. The seabass was seared nicely to give a nice crunch on the outside, while perfectly flaky and moist on the inside. It was served with stewed garbanzo, Swiss chard, and smoked potato. For desserts, we all had Tres Leches. It was served in a small Mason jar topped with 3 milks, and berries. Perfect way to end the meal. The portions are not large but it is filling. The flavors are fresh and very well balanced. The food presentation was notable. The Watermelon Tequila drink was delightful and refreshing. The froze was also a big hit. The cocktails were presented well and created perfectly. We enjoyed everything. Our waiter, Austin was very friendly. He made great recommendations and was very attentive.An 18% gratuity was added to the tab. There are lots of street parking accessible. In the end, the food was great. Ambience was amazing. The hostesses can use additional customer service training and learn to use better judgment to improve the customers experience. There was no need to escalate the matters to a manager. It could have been handled properly by showing empathy, apologizing, and finding a solution to the problem.",
      "Hi Kim,Thank you for dining with us and leaving a detailed review. It has been forwarded to our management team. Our apologies for the confusion at the door.  Glad to hear Collin accommodated you and your experience was turned around.  We are happy to see your great feedback regarding the food, cocktails, and Austin’s Service.  Hopefully you will join us again in the near future!",
      "This is my second time going to sea spice & I normally love it as the first time. I never leave bad reviews But this second time MY PHONE WAS STOLEN AND SECURITIES DID NOThing about it. Instead we're trying to blame me for the situation. I'm not drunk nor was drunk. I walked in with 2 phone and walked out with 1.We came as my friend USUALLY does and this is how they treated us  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME. I thought it was 5 star so nothing could go wrong. With a security right next to our table my phone STILLL got stolen. It was on the table. And to whoever has the time to steal phones is just sad imagine what else they can steal... I wil ask to review cameras but with the way I was treated when I let them know I lost my phone I doubt they will be helpful but I'll let every platform form of review know that they steal phones here. I know the exact time frame as well so they wouldn't even have to look much at the cameras. Let's see. BTW I BEEN HOME SICK AFTER EATING THESE OYSTERS I COULDNT Even celebrate my baby's birthday w him.",
      "Came here for my birthday dinner with my boyfriend for a 7:15 reservation (we called in advance for an outdoor seat dock side) we waited about ten minutes after our arrival for our table to be ready at the bar, the short wait was definitely worth it. Started with an aperol spritz at the bar then ordered octopus and gazpacho to start. Octopus portion was good but the olive oil tasted burnt since it came out on a sizzling hot cast iron looking skillet (its very easy to overcook octopus, please just bring a regular plate next time.) I also had the whole main lobster. Extremely delicious large portion of perfectly cooked and seasoned lobster, bravo. My boyfriend had the truffle coated Chilean sea bass and he absolutely loved it. Vibe: 5/5 this place definitely is a scene but not overwhelmingly pretentious or obnoxious. Absolutely loved the music as well. Service:3/5 A bit slow, our server was very attentive when we were able to get his attention but we had to always wave him down. Food: 4/5 everything was honestly pretty good (octopus could've had a bit more attention to detail)",
      "Hi Liz,Thank you for celebrating your birthday with us!  We are so happy to hear you had a great experience and enjoyed the food.  Your feedback regarding the octopus has been sent to our chef. We look forward to seeing you again soon!"

Incredible. - Tiramisu OMG - get it. - Tableside Caesar - Very nice server - Ben - Foccacia bread The good: - Meatball App - The wine cellar and steak presentation as you walk in is a nice touch General feedback: - Dimming the lights a bit more would give it some real ambiance and a homier feel  - They JUST opened so cut the staff some slack. I've been on a team opening a restaurant before and it's so hard. They did great! - Good location - easy access with ample parking. A local steakhouse is just what the neighborhood needs - The staff was really sweet and everyone was really working hard all night.",
      "Went here for a birthday dinner. They have a great menu with all sorts of selections.  Our waiter was pushy and rude.  We ordered a NY Strip, Branzino, Pasta Bolonaize, Filet Minan, truffle fries and salad.  The steaks were ordered medium well done.  All the food was good except the steaks.  They kept bringing back the steaks rare and the waiter was angry with nasty comments toward us.  If you go here avoid this guy.  We told the mgr who seemed surprised.",
      "The staff and Marco was amazing! The food, absolutely Devine, the portion the flavor, the attention to detail were all perfection. Thank you for making my husband's 40th bday so memorable.",
      "Hello my name is Nick. Of course I'm from New York. I usually don't write reviews specially bad ones we got to this nice restaurant very gorgeous inside. The bread was delicious. I have to say the first course was a pasta dish we split. It had a Bolognese sauce on it it was served hot and good. Little did I know that was the highlight of a dinner. My steak came out first they cut it up which I wasn't crazy about but it was cold. my friends ordered a veal dish a special order. They accommodated them but the dish also was ice cold. The dish presentation was very nice but it being cold was definitely a problem. I must mention the sides to twice cook baked potato was a baked potato not twice cooked. The cream spinach was nice fresh baby spinach sautéed with melted cheese on top. The menu, said cream of spinach. I do wish they would get their act together, and I would even consider trying it again. The Decour is very elegant. It was Christmas Eve. We got there at 6:15 and it wasn't that busy. There was no excuse for the cold food. I must say I was very disappointed. My name is nick hogan.",
      "Nice bar.  Quality food.   Good service    Except bartender Angie.  Good wine and liquor selection",
      "Great new restaurant. Not crowded yet. We got frutti dimare and branzino, both dishes were excellent. I especially liked that unlike many other places they go easy on a salt. Highly recommend!",
      "Rippoff stupid place out of place Does not belong among working class neighborhood Just close down and go to Ball Harbor",
      "Ridiculous prices for a basic Italian restaurant It will never make it in NMB Will not bring lunch customers at this prices Dinner customers will go to a well known reliable restaurant",
      "My boyfriend and I had been waiting for what felt like an eternity for this place to open because we love Frank so we had to check out a place named after his iconic song. Just like his song, our experience was great! The place feels intimate and has a great ambiance for a date night. The food was also incredible! Yet, the best part was the service. Our server Andrea was so sweet and helpful the entire night. I highly recommend!",
      "One of the most authentic Italian restaurants I've ever eaten at!  First rate and class-  Look forward to having many more meals at My Way!  Thanks to the incredible staff for an incredible evening.",
      "Perfect place for date night! The food was amazing and the staff very friendly and attentive. Can not go wrong with the BURRATA CAPRESE for starter and my favorite the FILETTO DI MANZO! So many tasty options can't wait to go back next time I am in town!"

      "We love Pinocchio! Great happy hour with Italian and other varietals of wine from 5-6.... Friendly staff and yummy croissants and juice and gelato and pasta and vegan cheesecake ..And a quiet ambiance you can bring your pets to. We probably moved to Edgewater because of moving this place so much ...",
      "There's nothing like Salmon toast with a view! We love love love Pinocchio! We come here at least 3 times a week for happy hour (5-6 pm) or breakfast (amazing croissants and pastries) or a pasta dinner!The staff is very warm and friendly - we started coming here and fell in love with the neighborhood so now are walking distance away which is such a blessing. We might move in lol....The salmon toast is my favorite I've had in the area, and the lowest price and cost. We enjoy lots of wine options, vegan dessert options, and a cool cafe ambiance. There's juice options too! Dogs are welcome - even inside! So we bring our pup often.",
      "This is a great little spot to come and enjoy coffee, tea, or even a glass of Italian wine! We were at a park down the street and stopped in for water while checking out this area in Miami. The staff was very friendly and there was so much to take in. Art and collectibles are all over. People had their pups on the patio and inside the cafe. There were candies and desserts I hadn't seen before, including vegan options which were nice. We were able to pause and have a glass of wine from a selection that was not only reasonably-priced, but of varieties, we were unable to get anywhere else but at Pinocchio. We stop in whenever in the area to check out all of the goods, which also include a bunch of salad and pasta options if you're more hungry than just looking for a snack or treat.",
      "This just wasn't the place for us. Nice views though.He got a scrambled egg special with prosciutto and arugula. Not impressed at all. It was supposed to be on a multigrain bread, but it wasn't. He said he burped it up all day and into the night. I got a margarita pizza. It was fine - would've been better before the put a bunch of olive oil on it. And it was just a cheese pizza with 4 basil leaves. Not a true margarita pizza with tomatoes. We both wanted unsweet tea - and the guy at the register told us there was Italian drinks in the cooler. I picked out Joe T green tea with ginseng. Holy crap - 60 grams of carbs. Taste was not for me. He got a tea with lemon and it was also loaded with a bunch of sugar. Our fault for not looking at the label - but shame on the guy for not saying anything to us when we asked for unsweetened tea and he rang these up. I mean, I guess I can't blame him when he's charging $5 for it.Again, a place that pops up a standard 15% tip for someone to walk my food out. Yes, you can change it. Seems a little presumptuous for a tip for someone taking my order and walking food to my table. I'd rather you call out my number and save myself the $5.",
      "This is our place to go on Saturday after a long walk. This is such a cute place, the food is always on point and the service is always good. I love the decor , the outside seating area. Their juices are amazing, we have tried almost all of them. Thy also have wine and beer. Love this restaurant",
      "Nice little Italian spot in front of Margaret Pace park. We were taking a bicycle ride in the park when suddenly stumbled upon this little gem. Eclectic indoor seating area and charming outdoor seating patio. It is a small place but very welcoming. It is also pet friendly. Seemingly a locals favorite spot. We just did a quick stop so we only got drinks. Macchiatone coffee was creamy and balanced. It didn't need any sugar. A glass of cold prosecco was just what the doctor ordered for a hot afternoon. Nice authentic Italian music playing in the background creating a  serene atmosphere. Rilassante! Prices are affordable for the area. Definitely a great spot in Edgewater. A presto!",
      "This was just okay.  Cute place inside and out with a nice view of the bay from the patio.  but the food was just okay.  I got the avocado toast however it was really a tomato toast with egg and a few slices of avocado.  Bread was a little doughy.  I don't recommend it. It was not enough avocado.   Hubby got the potato Española and it was tasty.",
      "Cute coffee and cafe snuggled under the quantum near Margaret pace park. The Pinocchio art and kitchy vibe are great, you can sit at a table, sofa a la friends central perk, or outside on the plant shaded patio. My dirty chai was well made, and there's also a refrig of other natural bottles and canned drinks.",
      "Omg! I think I found my new favorite spot! This place is great, truly a hidden gem. They have everything ranging from breakfast, pastries, drinks, coffee and ice cream. The atmosphere is very cool and corky especially tying in the Pinocchio theme. All the food we had was delicious, this has to be the best mimosas I've had in Miami, super refreshing. For the price definitely worth it! If you go definitely try one of the empanadas for they are bomb. Very veggie/vegan friendly; the pastries are to die for, had the almond croissant and it's better than Starbucks hands down. I will definitely be coming back. The nice this about the place is you can sit outside and it over looks the bay and it dubs as a market where you can buy specialty foods and drinks such as crackers, candy, wine etc. Great place to eat and hang out.",
      "This is awesome eclectic beachy cafe. They are located right  off of Biscayne Blvd. They are a community cafe. They offer breakfast and lunch items as well as smoothies/shakes. They have a lot of fresh baked items and a selection of beverages including wine. I had an opportunity on a couple of visits  to try a smoothie  and a sandwich. They were both great. Definitely worth the visit. The staff  will greet you with a smile.",
      "Came to this little cafe for a late breakfast to go today. My husband & I ordered an avocado toast, a prosciutto & scrambled eggs on a toast, and a passion fruit mango smoothie. My husband enjoyed his meal & I absolutely loved the smoothie. However, the avocado toast was subpar. It wasn't your typical avocado toast with avocado spread and I truly was not satisfied. Also, the bread was a multigrain nut bread (which was not specified), and I'm allergic to nuts so there goes that. The owners were great & I can tell that this a staple place for many of the people that live in the area. I wanted to try the coffee so maybe next time!"

      "Boia De is one of my favorite restaurants so of course made a reservation at Walrus Rodeo the second I heard about it. Ordered way too much for 2 people but wanted to try as many dishes as possible in case reservations become impossible. Everything was delicious but highly recommend the 'Rodeo Za' and the gnocchiThe only thing I would skip next time was the carrot tartare (a bit bland and just didn't compare to everything else)Hopefully I can come again soon!",
      "Made a reservation at Walrus Rodeo after a recommendation from a friend and wow! There is simply nothing like this in Miami. Every dish is cooked in a wood-fired oven, meant to share and carefully thought out (from the mix of ingredients & flavors to the cute menu item names). The restaurant is tucked away in an unusual location but iykyk. The restaurant was full with lines ups  throughout the night. We started our meal with the Charbroiled Oysters (topped with jalapeño and breadcrumbs) and the Chicory Salad (topped with hazelnuts and a green goddess dressing). The oysters were fresh and had a unique flavor. The chicory salad was simple but a nice palette cleanser. The Schmaltz Roasted Maitake Mushroom (topped with heirloom beans, roasted kale, sesame seems) was our favorite dish and a must have! The Rodeo Za (white anchovies, tomatoes and maple-butter crust) was ok. The maple crust was tasty, however the pizza lacked flavor and richness (felt like we were eating bread topped with bread. For dessert, we shared the Busta Rhymes graham churro. It comes with topped with a marshmallow puree and chocolate drizzle. Beautiful presentation and delicious.Service was outstanding and the wine list is great. Overall, great experience and look forward to trying other dishes!",
      "I was so excited to try this restaurant, as I genuinely love boia de, but sadly, I'm very disappointed by the service. A few nights ago, my friends and I had dinner there and ordered a white pizza- one of their specials. The waiter failed to mention the price of the pizza when discussing the specials, but it sounded yummy, so we ordered it. However the pizza was very average and extremely thin. Nothing special. After paying, we noticed the price of the pizza. It was $95. Yes. $95. Almost $100 for PIZZA. Average pizza. When we saw this, we alerted one of the waiters. He said he'd speak to someone and get back to us. However, no one ever came to us. After waiting a while, we got tired/bothered and left. Very disappointed by this experience, especially considering my love for boia de. Sadly, I won't be going back.",
      "Very interesting menu and combinations of flavors. we tried the oysters from Prince Edward Island that were roasted in the oven and the anchovie pizza with a maple brown butter crust. Both were interesting. Our server was quite knowledgeable about the menu and wine selection. We will be back to try more dishes.",
      "My boyfriend and I are we're doing a staycation in Miami and I've been dying to try Bioa De for the longest time. We unfortunately couldn't get a reservation so we tried to walk in, but no dice. Luckily Walrus Rodeo is right next door and undiscovered thus far. Everything was superb. Seriously, I haven't had a meal this awesome in a WHILE. Also, the service was spectacular. Highly recommend coming before they become super hype and impossible to get a reservation. We ordered the chicory salad, wahoo crudo, quail, za, cabbage, s'mores. SO GOOD!",
      "Unbelievable!!! This restaurant is phenomenal! This was an amazing food experience and everything is cooked in a wood fired oven. The food was out of this world and this is a must try! It honestly wasn't even as expensive as you would think. The pork belly lettuce wraps and the cabbage carbonara were my favorites. They also accommodate for gluten free. You have to check this spot out! Amazing !!!!",
      "Honestly this restaurant is mind altering. I walked in around 10pm in hopes that there was open seating. The lady at the front gave me an option of a table or the bar but recommended to sit with Sean the bartender for pure entertainment. My friend and I had the best service and going forward I would prefer to sit at the bar with Sean over any table. I loved the detailed explanation of the overall menu and concept; and the fact that the chef had worked in so many wonderful cities and was bringing his own flare to the menu. Sean recommend a fantastic wine to pair perfectly with my meal. I only had two dishes, the first being the chard oysters which where 5/5 and brought me back to New Orleans memories. The second plate was the red pizza (I can't remember the exact name!) it was life changing and dare I say better than any item on the boia de menu!!! (It's that GOOD) it had the perfect spice level for me, along side great aspects that pulled me into a flavorful heaven. I will be back 100%, WELCOME TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD",
      "Great new spot in Miami. Great vibe, amazing food. Unexpected dishes that take calculated risks and it pays off. Cabbage carbonara is the sleeper best dish. Also, beautiful wine list.",
      "In three months, you won't be able to get a reservation at Walrus Rodeo the latest creation from the team that brought you Boia De. We were lucky enough to try the restaurant out during its soft opening. From the first bite of our first dish, we understood that the CIA trained chefs in the kitchen had been given the leeway to play with our senses and delight us. We started with the charbroiled oysters paired with a salad with green goddess dressing and the schmaltz roasted maitake mushrooms. Each dish scored an OMG. We then had the spiny lobster puttana which was moist and light. It was followed by the mustard green lasagna which scored an OMG with each bite. There are two pizzas on the menu and we had then both. It's not a pizza joint, but I suspect many people will call this the best pizza in South Florida. We watched the CIA trained chef make our pizza and we knew we were in for a treat. One white, one red. We paired our food with a Valpolicella and it worked well. Service was friendly and professional and the staff seemed genuinely happy to be part of a team that was creating something special. The restaurant manager is a Danny Meyer alumn and she brings that level of professionalism to Walrus Rodeo. We're getting on Resy this morning to make another reservation."

It was relaxing and private. My boss and I were easily there about 3 hours. I ordered the Chicken Parmesan and it was a massive portion. We'd already had a charcuterie board which they amazingly accommodated her food allergy needs. The cocktails were fantastic, as was the wine menu and the after dinner limoncello's hit the spot. It was a lovely evening and the bustling district outside was great for people watching. Will absolutely visit next time I am in Miami.",

We all ordered different things and I got to try most of it and I can definitely say that you can't go wrong ordering pasta, my favorite was the Butternut Squash Anolini and the Strozzapreti, both had so much flavor and perfect balance between all the ingredients, the other pastas were really really good as well. For dessert we got the Hazelnut Torta which kind of just hugged our stomach, it was the perfect ending for our dinner, the salted caramel ice cream on top of the hazelnut cake and the crunchy pieces were chef's kiss, incredible!!! 10/10",
      "Thank you so much for this review, Mariana. We're very happy you and your party enjoyed our Butternut Squash Anolini, Strozzapreti, amazing service, and ambiance. We look forward to seeing you again soon to enjoy more of our Hazelnut Torta.",
      "The place Is great. And the services Is outstanding. Qué met Tatiana... Our waitress. Wow.. she was fantastic!She is the reason to return! We asked for the Manager (Carlos) and also a great guy.",
      "Thanks for your review, German. We're glad our team provided great service when you dined with us. We look forward to your next visit.",
      "Finally came to North Italia . I always pass by so I'm glad I was able to pay it a visit! Love the aesthetic of the place. Very minimalist and spacious. Even at the table, there is a generous amount of space between guest that are at your table and between other tables as well. I also loved that you can see the chefs in the kitchen through a clear glass window. It just added to the aesthetic. The service was great here. He was attentive and nice. I went during brunch, and really wanted to try brunch items but I was also in the mood for pasta. I chose pasta this time around but I'll go back for the brunch another time! I ordered Alfredo salmon pasta. It was good but a bit too salty. I'd come back again to this place! Seems like it's great for big parties, families and nice dinner date.",
      "Thanks for your review, Chanae. We're glad you enjoyed our Alfredo salmon pasta and great service while dining with us. We hope to see you again soon.",
      "Great location in Miami with amazing food, super knowledgeable staff and great service. Whether you're sitting indoors or outdoors, the staff is accommodating and very attentive. I went back two days in a row. First for a Margherita pizza and salad, and the second time again for a salad and a pasta dish along with some dessert. Good selection of wines as well which made it a very pleasurable and great experience. Looking forward to coming back and going again. Second time around I brought three friends from LA to experience and they loved it as well.",
      "Hi Troy, thank you for your review. We're so happy you enjoy our Margherita pizza, salad, dessert, and great service. We hope to see you again soon.",
      "Had a work peer in town and we wanted to go somewhere close to where we were working.  We wanted casual and low key.  This was pretty chill for Miami.  Loved the outdoor seating but there was bird poop on some of the chairs but you know it happens sometimes with outdoor seating.  Just gotta keep it clean Server was so friendly and patient The food was great.  We had chicken park, short rib and a garden salad with salmon. My salmon was perfectly cooked.  The other part of our group raves about the short rib and the chicken park.  I think they were great over all.",
      "Hi Lori, we're glad you enjoyed our friendly service, Chicken Parmesan, short rib, salad, and salmon. Next time, if you are not satisfied with your seating, please let our managers know so we can do whatever is possible to make it right. We hope to see you again soon. Thanks.",
      "When I saw \"toasted bread with good olive oil\" on the menu, I knew this was going to be my kind of place. And it did not disappoint, that olive oil was GOOD! Sitting outside on the beautiful patio eating delicious Italian food made for a wonderful lunch. The tuna crudo app was also incredibly tasty, as was the prosciutto pizza. I opted for the beet salad, which came as a decent portion, I was actually unable to finish the whole thing, and dang was that the right amount of goat cheese! Service was really kind and prompt, excellent place overall!",
      "Hi Olga, thank you for your review. We're glad you enjoyed our delicious food and kind service. We look forward to your next visit"

      "Came here for lunch after my college graduation. The location is BEAUTIFUL and really adds to the whole ambiance. For apps we had the octopus and the pink brick. Both were so incredibly delicious and perfect portion for sharing with my party of 5. I had the New York strip and oh wow! Cooked to perfection and DELICIOUS. I had some of my dad's salmon and that was also some of the best salmon I've had. Got some gorgeous pictures outside as well. It's pricey but not anything outrageous.

      "Man I miss that Sunday Brunch Buffet.That was the bomb back in the day. Biggest buffet in Dade. Lotta fish, oysters, crab legs.They still have brunch, just no buffet. Same great service, same great food.No offense, but if they served only bologna sammiches, I would go. So would you.It's one of the greatest views of downtown.Watch the sailboats drift on by....Sit outside by the water... Especially at night with the fire pits lit..(sounds nice now on December, not August)It's an institution... Get on over there!The pelican has been here forever, and will go on...and on...",

      "When talking about any list of South Florida restaurants with the best waterfront dining, Rusty Pelican always belongs at the top of the list. Tables on Biscayne Bay that face west to take in the Miami Skyline across the water. This is the place to have superior service, delicious food, well crafted drinks, while taking in the most picturesque sunset you could imagine. I can't say enough about this landmark in Miami, that has withstood the test of time, while maintaining frequent renovations and upgrades to continue as the premier waterfront dining destination. Whether you are a resident, or a visitor, The Rusty Pelican is a must!",
      "It is very nice to hear that we were able to achieve such a wonderful experience! We look forward to seeing you soon! Thank you for choosing us and we hope to see you soon!",
      "The views are phenomenal, and the service was extremely patient, attentive, and always with a smile. I forgot our server's name (she was definitely Eastern European), but it's one of the best customer service experiences I've ever had in a restaurant.We had a large group reservation, as we were celebrating my daughter coming back from overseas, as well as having my father over, and having all of the grandkids together for the first time. Lots of drinks were ordered and consumed and service was all the more for it.I had the fried chicken and waffle, and I must say the plating was beautiful. I was the only one with a wooden slab, which fit perfectly. The chicken was fried bone-in, so not just a chicken breast, and it tasted delicious. The waffle had great flavor as well, but I tend to eat these without syrup and I felt like I had to drizzle some on to make it better.The smoked salmon benedict had an amazing amount of Hollandaise! The eggs were perfectly poached and the smoked salmon was just right. However, the real star was probably the crab huevos rancheros. About 4 people in our table ended up ordering it, and it was hard just to get one or two bites in as they would get greedy over it. It was hard not to - it was a great flavor melody and I would have done the same.Drinks wise? I would go with the Maracuya. The presentation is amazing, and I'm a sucker for all things passion fruit. At $22 it's quite pricey but it really is an amazing drink.Will return with a smaller group at some point, but I was mad at myself for waiting so long to go there after so much time.",
      "Thank you for taking your time to conduct such a well thought review! We definitely appreciate your thoughtfulness. We are happy to hear that our server Kata delivered such delightful service! We hope to see you soon!",
      "Terrific restaurant!  The food was excellent, and the service matched.  All the tables have beautiful views of the harbor, with indoor and outdoor seating. Thomas was very attentive, just the right amount of touch.  Parking is very limited; you have to use the valet service, and I'm not super cool with other people driving my car, but it was alright.",
      "Haven't been here since 2020 when I left Miami, but my favorite brunch in town has certainly changed from what it used to be. No more buffet and now it's all done off the menu. Food wasn't bad, memosa's were great (loved all 4 variations) but the overall experience just wasn't what it once was and the service was a little disappointing (dirty glasses, not replacing silverware, etc)Still a classic destination for ambiance but hopefully you don't get put in a corner like we did and have a server stations blocking the view."

      "Wow! This place has amazing Cuban sandwiches and delicious mojitos!! We came after seeing some Recs on social media. Wow we were amazed on the quality of the food. I had the Cuban sandwich and wow it was well prepared and better than most Cuban sandwiches I've had even in Chicago. The guava mojito was so unique. It had a sugar cane in it and was very refreshing and tasty Our Cuban server was such a gentleman and took care of us well! My entire family was impressed and we wanted to come back again!",
      "We were greeted by the manager and host like all restaurants in Miami Beachfront. My friend and I ordered the Hawaiian Shrimp Ceviche to split. We both enjoyed the flavor and were surprised by how well the cooked shrimp and pineapple worked for a ceviche dish. For our entrees, I ordered the Ropa Vieja and my friend ordered the Lechón Asado. We both enjoyed our entrees! My friend especially liked the side of Yucas. Unfortunately, there was a con of slow service. It took some time for our waitress, Ly, to greet us. She only did after I called for someone's attention. Then when we requested boxes, that took some time along with my request for the check. It's a common thing in Miami Beach to have 18-20% tip added on. This restaurant autocharged 20% for service that was not worth 20%...",
      "There is a lot to like here, except for the prices. I was really perplexed by them. $22 dollars for an appetizer of calamari, and $17 for two empanadas? Kind of felt like a rip-off. The restaurant has an outdoor terrace which is nice but all food comes from the hotel in back. I thought the meals were plated well but then again, those prices were a sore spot for me, and I'm not cheap, or don't have the means... just simply think the value isn't really there. I'm from Boston and a $300 meal after tip usually means moderate to dining to an elegant night out, not casual Cuban food. Strange. That's all I can say. Would probably not return. The service was acceptable and timely, but it seems like the waitress begged for a good \"Trip Advisor Review to really help her out with the owners\". Ok?Havana 1957 is much better, but I've had better Cuban sandwiches outside of Miami. Hmmm.",
      "Oh. My. Goodness. This was SO good!I told my fiancé - this is the first Cuban sandwich you've ever had and every other you have for the rest of your life probably won't live up to it haha. The food was so good it makes up for our server that ignored us basically the whole time we were there. Almost. But, wow, great food, great patio, great drinks. We got mango juice and guava(I think) lemonade. The mojitos looked incredible and everyone seemed to be ordering them. I might plan another trip to Miami just to enjoy this place again!",
      "This Cuban place had great food when delivered.I got their croquetas which were super soft on the outside while having a crispy and well seasoned outside.The ropa vieja was the main dish that was excellent. This is akin to shredded beef stew. It was seasoned well and came with excellent rice and black beans as well as fried plantains. The plantains had a nice sweetness that rounded off the meal nicely.",
      "I really cannot figure out why this place is so expensive. The tables are uncomfortably close together, it's not very fancy, the food is mediocre, and yet the prices for some items were outrageous. Ex- $42 for a paella dish that was on the smaller side, $38 for a beef sandwich, $20+ for a Cuban sandwich, etc. The prices were way higher than other restaurants in the area and the quality did not justify it.I got the shrimp (camarones al ajillo) and they came in a bowl of liquid. Was it butter? Was it wine? I have no clue but it was very off putting. Everything was also very bland. I feel bad leaving a poor review since the staff was so nice but I really would not recommend this place to anyone.",
      "South Beach rain is inevitable that's for sure... but I think it adds to the vibe and sets the mood for what can become a great night. Located in Hotel Chelsea & directly across the street from Moxi Hotel (another hotel spot worth reviewing) it's the perfect spot to kick things off with dinner. Some of the best authentic Cuban food I've had on South Beach. Typically I venture away from this area and head to Calle Ocho street in Little Havana where I have some family connects and they even suggested this spot. Sitting outside in the covered patio is great and they can accommodate larger groups. It's sexy that's for sure. The Menu is large in size, but part of the experience and I did like how it wasn't flooded with a ton of items. With the semi-large groups around us, it was an opportunity to see all the dishes come out. We did some traditional empanadas and fried calamari to start. Both were really good and complimented them with quite a few classic Mojitos! For dinner we had the Whole Florida Red Snapper and I think we made the 2 tables near us envious... I let them take a few pix and yes... it was good as it looked. Also had the Churrasco. Steak was a bit overcooked to my liking but the combination of the rice and black beans still made it great. Would highly recommend and plan to return back. Get your party on and celebrate a birthday here as they do make you feel special.",
      "Food is amazing. Outdoor seating is great. Service is exceptional. Would definitely come here again",
      "This place had really good food and excellent daiquiris! They have a large rum selection. The food was authentic and moderately priced for south beach. Great lunch spot with outdoor seating and friendly staff!",
      "Had a delicious lunch here on our last day in Miami. Started with the ropa vieja empanadas, and I could have eaten a dozen of them with the delicious cilantro sauce on the side. Piping hot deliciousness on a cold day. The lechón was very good, though missing that delicious chunk of crisp skin most include. The cubano sandwich was also delicious. Drinks were quite powerful, and service was great. Definitely will come back next time."

Juicy!  We already made plans to come back next week and they are catering our meal for Thanksgiving!   Stop by...  they have a great spot on Calle 8!Thanks guys...   see you next week!",
      "Doesn't exist! Address is correct but not he business name. Shows a Tierra coffee shop",
      "Excellent service Good foodWas happy Jorge was able to provide us with a delicious meal during this time. I watched him whip up a dish while wearing his PPE. Thank you- much appreciated!",
      "A different definition to \"Latin Trap\" is what you get when you come here to indulge in their dosage of fine mofongo served deliciously. Dude, they even wrap it in a pechuga de pollo! I'm all about that chuleta though. With white rice and habichuelas on the side of every dish, these folks serve up bóricua goodness in many forms. It's about hidden but worth the search. It's authentic as can be so order with ease; you're bound to get a delicious plate no matter the dish. It's home cooked food served just right with soul and passion in every bite so they rank high on my list. Alcapurrias here are perfectly crunchy and filling served and dipped inside the habichuelas broth. I even sampled their homemade hot sauce and enjoyed the level of heat paired with my healing portion of freshly made rice. Representing la isla del encanto to the fullest! I love this spot!",
      "There isn't one bad thing I can say about this restaurant. We started with salads drizzled with their homemade dressing. The salad has the perfect balance of tart, nutty and sweetness. Consisted of mixed green house salad topped with cranberries, raisins, pistachios, almonds and feta cheese. My husband and I both had the mofongo stuffed chicken breast; mine with arroz con gandules, and his with white rice and habichuelas guisadas. Everything was flavored to perfection. The chicken breast was juicy and flavorful. The mofongo wasn't dry and the habichuelas were the best I've had in Miami. We also had fruit popsicles as dessert and it was so refreshing in the Miami humidity. The chefs were so welcoming and rightfully took pride in their work. We stayed behind and chatted with them both and it really felt like we were just hanging out with friends. We got to learn about the humble beginning of Dos Alas Kitchen and how their hard work has taken them so far. I don't usually write reviews, but there is no way I couldn't let the world know how awesome this place is. The attached picture was my plate, we were dining during covid so that is why it was served togo in a styrofoam container.",

      "Again the most delicious and authentic PuertoRican food in town. Did I mention how clean and great the eating area is?? And the staff is beyond friendly and helpful. Anything to make their client happy!!!",
      "Finally a delicious and authentic Puertorican kitchen. It's a small place and food taste as if it were home cooked. I ordered the Hibichuelas and the plain mofongo and both were delicious. I'd give it a six start bc I was able to take a peek at the kitchen and it's incredibly clean.",
      "First time trying this place out. Were from California and we wanted something authentic. Even though it's small this place definitely was authentic and fresh. The service was on point and they gave us ice cream on the house! I got the grilled chicken and plantations. Food was hot and didn't take too long. Definitely worth the visit, highly recommend.",
      "\"Un poulet de luxe qui se balade dans la Rue Huit.\"Many years ago, my wife and my two year-old daughter left our hotel in Paris a little bit late for dinner (it was 9 PM, which shouldn't be a problem in a cosmopolitan city) and we had a hard time finding an open place. Finally a Vietnamese taxi driver took pity as he passed by us (distraught faces with a little girl in tow) and signaled us to come over. When we explained what was going on, he said:\"No problem, hop in and I will fix it for you.\" He drove a few miles to a small, elegant restaurant near the Pantheon (the sacrosanct place for French where their greatest men/women are interred, including Napoleon Bonaparte) It was closed and without lights. \"Go in right away,\" he said, \"they will take good car of you there.\" We reluctantly did as he said and opened the door. We were gladly struck immediately by the fine set-up of the resto with fine linen and cutlery on the table; the impeccably groomed waiters were cleaning the premises. A lady came forth and said; \"bienvenue a notre maison...asseyez-vous!\" She snapped her fingers and ordered her staff to open the kitchen for us. Her name was Madame Nicole and her resto was \"Dodin Bouffant;\" we had a memorable dinner as she supervised every meal and drink we took.This memory came to our minds when last week Mary and I casually strolled into the little shop of chef Jorge to buy some chicken. Coming out of the kitchen, he told us that it was closed and he was busy with the catering orders with his staff in the back. \"Can you sell us one simple chicken with some rice and salad?\" I said. \"Of course,\" he replied. He immediately suggested an introductory special of a family meal with one roasted chicken with rice and gandules, coupled with a big salad. The meat was perfectly roasted outside and juicy inside; there was no greasiness or any offensive seasoning. All for the incredibly affordable price of U$ 21.99. Can you believe it?  Please look at the meal's presentation.Chef Jorge worked many years in the Cruise business and it does show. That salad is worthy of the best restos of New York City or Paris. By the way, we teasingly used the name \"poulet de luxe\" to refer to his dish as a play of words because, in the French argot, \"une poule de luxe\"  refers to a beautiful trophy woman; a French restauratrice in NYC used this term to label her signature chicken dish. So, ladies, if you want to meet this bird and/or his maker, don't delay.The only drawback of this new place is the lack of proper seating arrangements for a regular family to eat there comfortably; there is only a counter-top and a few stools. But we are confident that Chef Jorge will prosper and move to a more comfortable setting. Merde!",
      "This place is up the street from us and we've been meaning to go since they opened. They exceeded our expectations. It is run by a professional chef who makes high end high quality versions of traditional dishes. The chicken was cooked perfectly, and the beans (habichuelas guisada) were awesome. My 14 month old daughter liked it too. This will be our go to place.I'm guessing the chef opened the restaurant mainly to have a place for his catering business. There are no tables, only take out. I've already recommended it to other locals."

Good selection of beers, too.Really couldn't ask for much more.",

The place is big but since we sat outside it was hard to get someone to refill our drinks. Drinks I wasn't impressed neither. Too sweet for my taste but I just don't like sweet cocktails/ more refreshing ones. I tried the skirt steak and it was good. Simple. My bf tried a fish and it was nothing special. Great place to meet with friends of happy hour."

We've always been to Miami but never really dined  out  because when we visit my in-laws they always cook for us so there is really no need to dine out . But this time we wanted something different a lady across the street recommend thisPlace to us and she strongly recommended that if we did not have a reservation that we get one ASAP I see why because they only have a few tables but they were able to accommodate us. Our servers Fabricio and Christian  were the best very attentive . For starters there is a complimentary champagne which was very nice fruity and crispy . Then we had escargot was baked in garlic and parley butter the escargot was baked to perfection  it was nice and tender not rubbery and nicely seasoned perfect with the freshly baked bread and butter for the main entree I had the LES MOULES MARINIÈRES POMMES FRITESCOMME À BRUXELLES in English Fresh steamed mussels with white wine and shallots served with French fries. The mussels was cooked to perfection the broth was citrusy light it was not salty at all .  The fries was perfect ! I am nice a French fries type of person but it was so good lightly salted and fried perfectly I ate all of it myself . Then my husband ordered the LA FRICASSÉE DE VOLAILLE À L'ANCIENNE, RISOTTO AUX CÉPES ET BISCUIT DE PARMESANin English Chicken fricassee served with a porcini mushroom risotto and parmesan biscuit. The chicken was so tender the risotto was cooked in perfection it was so creamy my husband ate all of it!

      "I've driven past many times when I worked in South Dade. We finally ate there with friends last night. It might replace our beloved French bistro on South Beach that was sadly a victim of covid.Start first with the flute of champagne offered to all diners. That really sets a relaxing mood. Three in the party enjoyed the onion soup, two had the dinner salad. I had the chevre salad - it was huge. The cheese just perfect and the dressing delicious. Three of the party had the chicken with risotto - served in a pot. Two had the duck confit, looked delicious. Our host recommended the mussels, so I went with that. I could not believe how huge the portion was! Enough for two people easily. And just perfect in a broth of wine, herbs, and butter. The french fries were also perfect. The only downside was that the waiter did not give me the left over fries to enjoy the remaining mussels.Needless to say, we were all too full to try the desserts though we were tempted. Looking forward to returning when on that side of town.",
      "I've been going to Le Bouchon du Grove in the Coconut Grove area of Miami for probably 17 years.  One of the best of the older French restaurants in the Miami area.  It closed for awhile, I believe, during COVID, but has now come back stronger than ever.  Five of us went for lunch today - we had pancakes light and airy, rich onion soup, delicious chicken fricassee, a nice ox tail and foie gras terrine and fresh tasty salads.  Oh, and did I mention the great bottle of Sancerre.  I will keep going back here for good hearty French food.",
      "Omg delicious food! Atmosphere very nice! Excellent service! Great location in the groves. The dessert was also great! Recommend for a nice romantic dinner or any special occasion.",
      "I love this little piece of France in the grove. This bistro highlights classics and classics they do well. The complimentary mimosa when you sit down is refreshing. Love the baguette and jam. We have done their cheese plate, goat and cheese omelet and their mussels are a must. My husband recently had the salmon with ratatouille and really enjoyed it. This is one of the only places in town you can get a real chocolate mousse. Love this place!",
      "Hadn't been to Le Bouchon in a hot minute, but decided to come here with my boo to celebrate our anniversary.Upon arriving, they serve each person a complimentary glass of champagne, which is already worthy of a 5-star review. But, the food and atmosphere here are also absolutely incredible. We started with the onion soup and escargots, which were both incredibly delish and flavorful. For our entrees, I opted for the mussels with fries and my mans got the chicken fricasse with mushroom risotto. The portions are HUGE, so definitely keep that in mind when ordering. While I wasn't able to tackle all of the mussels, thankfully we were able to take the leftover mushroom risotto home. We ended the meal with their creme brûlée, which was also a generous portion.The service is so attentive and friendly and they don't skimp on the bread (which is a huge deal for me for some reason - LOL). The dining area is a bit cramped ,but thankfully we were sat in a more spacious area facing the open street (how French, right?!)Overall, a delightful experience!",
      "OMG! This restaurant is literally like taking a flight to Paris. At 1st i didn't like how close the tables seemed together or how congested it seemed but once I was seated it really added to the ambiance! The wait staff is amazing I love going to a restaurant where the Waiters/Waitresses can provide great suggestions from the menu because it shows they eat there or are at least very attentive to whats being order frequently. So definitely 1000% check this place out its literally Paris in Coconut Grove... Appetizers - Escargot en persillade Entree - La fricasse de volaille a l ancienne , risotto aux cepes et biscuit de parmesan or Les moules marinièresDessert - Creme Brûlée a la vanille de Madagascar",
      "Coconut Grove is such a posh area and Le Bouchon has all those key characteristics. It's on the main drag. It was packed with other diners. French food! Specifically Lyonnaise. After a recent trip to Paris, we were still hankering for a good French petit dejeuner and so we decided to try it.Luckily, they were able to seat us without a wait!The tables are packed in tight. This is not usually an issue, however the table legs are substantial and butt up right against the booth seating. Which is to say, it was a little difficult to get into the booth, and once I was there, there was no option to get up until we were done with our meal. And when our meal was done, the best way to get up was to have the diners on the other side of the table pull the entire table out. Brunch started with a complementary mimosa for each diner. It was at strong, but quite frankly, I prefer a juicier than champagneier mimosa. We had planned to split the petit dejeuner plate for a starter, which was said to be a cafe au lait and French bread with butter and jam. Our waiter, who was a bit gruff, was at least very honest. He advised us that it would wind up being a very expensive coffee as he would be bringing us a basket of bread with butter and jam. Easy peasy. Unfortunately, while he did provide the bread and butter, the bread was obviously defrosted as the center was ice cold. For my meal, I asked if I could get the eggs Benedict with a vegetarian swap out for the ham. They told me they couldn't do spinach and did not offer a different substitute. I ordered it anyway and it was good. If I liked ham, I might've enjoyed it better. At least the ham was cooked crisply, which was more palatable for me at least. I wound up giving my husband all of the ham. He was thrilled. The dish otherwise was good. Basic. Served with about 5 pieces of breakfast potatoes. (See photo.)My father in law got the steak sandwich and said it was good! But not special. I did enjoy my cafe au lait though!",
      "Was looking for a new breakfast spot. Beautiful views and very cozy. Food was delicious."

      "THANK YOU for being open on Christmas Day! Our culinary tour guide was Sebastian and he provided all the guidance we needed... an absolute natural. That banana split tho !!!",
      "I absolutely love what the group from Ariete has done here! This place is dark, low key & gave me NYC vibes. Note they do not take reservations and it is quiet small. Arrive early or expect to wait. Also, my biggest gripe is their service as it pertains to seating. They are not very accommodating to larger parties (we were 8). We were able to make it work eventually but the gentlemen working last night was not friendly & truly did not care to help our party sit together until we were about to complain. I get it; this is a \"hot spot\" and they want to turn tables but a little bit of helpful service here can go along way.I started with the Kentucky river cocktail, grilled oysters and chicken croquettes. The oysters were fantastic. The chicken croquettes were good but when I go back I'd probably opt to try something else. We also shared a cheeseburger and that was really good! Given that we were apart of a larger party I was able to try a few bites of the cesar salad and the pasta (it was spicy). Their banana split for dessert was amazing too.Although we didnt get a chance to listen to the music last night they do offer live music daily. Despite the seating challenges this was place is a nice addition to the neighborhood and Id come back.",
      "Fire.The Gibson Room is a great cocktail bar with a top notch food and live music.  Coming in at 7 on a Saturday night I noticed the restaurant wasn't full and was worried! By 7:30 there wasn't a single seat to be had.  I grabbed a Kentucky River and waited at the bar for family and was quickly seated once they arrived.The cocktail put me in a good mood and we quickly ordered grilled oysters and charcuterie to start off the night.  The servers were attentive and were constantly filling water and making it seamless.  I didn't ask for recommendations but the short rib caught my eye and we ordered half the menu.The food totally rocked.  My favorite thing on the charcuterie board was the chicken liver mousse, so right on toasted baguette I still think about weeks later.  The char grilled oysters reminded me of New Orleans and I followed up with a Mexican Razor a well balanced Mezcal libation. The short rib came with a Hasselback potato, sliced super thin and crispy, it was on an unctuous pepperjack mornay with great savory flavor.  My taste buds were buzzing.  The short rib was so tender with caramelized onions it was all in harmony and the food sang loudly.  Such high level cuisine, a real pleasure!I didn't stay long enough for the music but would go again in a heartbeat.  Long live The Gibson Room!",
      "Cool place with live music and good food.A nice full bar is the main attraction here, with some spectacular cocktails created by their bartenders. The tables are mainly for customers who will be eating and not just having drinks.  So maybe get some tapas or full menu if you want to enjoy the Gibson room from a more comfortable place. The menu is not big but has lots of options, and almost all are good. Ambiance is truly nice and inviting. Great for a night out with friends or a date.Also notable are prices... they were very reasonable, compared to other places in the area. Service is friendly and attentive.",
      "We went for the ambience because we really enjoy live music. I didn't particularly like the one man band playing at the Gibson on this night though. The drinks were good but definitely small. I had a tequila cocktail on the menu... a Mexican something. Really good tasting but also very small. The grilled oysters were good. For meals we had the oxtail and shrimp ramen, really delicious; and the burger also really good. I'm not sure I'd go back for a meal although the food was tasty the menu is really small. If the drinks were a bit more generous I'd go back for a night cap.",
      "The previous iteration of The Gibson Room (The Mighty) was my neighborhood bar, and I loved it dearly. I was there almost every Saturday night, and I knew I could always rely on their delicious tacos, fries and beer. When I heard that The Mighty had closed and made way for an Ariete Hospitality property, I was simultaneously bummed and excited. Bummed that my favorite bar was no longer, excited for what the Ariete team had up its sleeve.I was finally able to check out The Gibson Room yesterday, and I'm already a fan. Let's get the annoying stuff out of the way - they won't seat you until your full party is there and had arbitrary seating rules (like refusing to seat 5 people at a table for 4?) Thankfully, the bar had plenty of seating to accommodate our party, so we didn't have to wait around. I succumbed to the Negroni Sbagliato TikTok trend and ordered one here. Never had a Negroni, and I don't like gin, so I didn't have high hopes. BUT, the mixologists here know what they're doing and created such a delicious cocktail that I just had to order another. My boo and I split an order of the chargrilled oysters, which at $21 for 1/2 dozen were just \"okay\" in my opinion. We also split the schnitzel and the hasselback potato, which were both absolutely incredible. Generous portions, perfect for sharing and worth the price tag. Our friend ordered the tamal en casuela, which I had a small bite of and can confirm is insanely delicious. It's $35 for the \"larger\" size (which is still pretty small in my opinion), but damn if the taste isn't worth it. Overall, the prices here are typical of other Ariete restaurants. Hefty, but worth it. The service at the bar was attentive, and if live music is your jam, that was starting up right around 10 p.m. Street parking can be found out front or in the surrounding areas.",
      "At first glance, big difference in the ambiance from its predecessor The Mighty. There is a host waiting at the door as you walk in to seat you but only when your full party arrives. The drinks were well made and honestly the reason for the two stars. I did not try the food (as we were there for drinks), but others in the party ordered the croquetas which were a bit heavy, pasta which was okay, and a big ass salad which wasn't as big as the name suggested. Now the reason for my rating is the management. We had two friends arrive a bit later. Soon after they sat down and another round of drinks were ordered, a man who seemed to be the manager came by to ask them to leave because they weren't a part of our original party. This was despite being seated comfortably. For that reason we canceled our orders and left. You'd think a new spot would want the business, but I guess The Gibson Room will always live in the shadow of The Mighty.",
      "I fucking love The Gibson Room. The food is incredible. The cocktail menu is classic and unique. The waiters and bartenders are super cool people and very good at what they do. It feels like everyone who works here actually cares and wants you to have a good experience. Every drink is balanced and made to perfection. I've never had a question about an ingredient or cooking method the staff didn't know the answer to. There's live music most nights that is perfectly curated to the location. They have monthly collaboration dinners that are easily some of the best tastings I have ever been to. One of the only restaurants I have seen with a cocktail pairing and a wine pairing. A huge thanks to anyone involved in making this place what it is. My only genuine complaints are I want to come here too often and every burger I eat now is just okay in comparison to the one they make.",
      "Chill jazz vibe, beautiful fully stocked bar, good for dinner and good cocktails. The ramen, oysters and deserts we're delicious. The house Gibson, white negroni and daquiri we're excellent cocktails. Highly recommend visiting",
      "The Gibson room is a low key speak easy vibe with good drinks and food. We enjoyed the Gibson martini with the following dishes. Got great recommendations from server and made us feel at home."

      "ThIs is a laid back steak house ,great prices - excellent quality and nice atmosphere. This is the kinda place you can eat at every week.",
      "Out of this world delicious. My husband and I sat at the bar. We had a ribeye with Quilmes (Argentinean beer) the perfect combo! Steak and fries were perfectly cooked. Bartender was kind and professional. Restaurant was \"de bote a bote\" like they say in Spanish (meaning crazy busy). We sat next to the kitchen and literally every plate that passed us looked out of this world delicious. High quality perfectly cooked food. Highly recommend for groups, in town guests, and date nights.",
      "WOW just WOW. Had the prime Picanha steak and the Fiorito Steak Salad. Amazing amazing 10 out of 10. Prices are not bad- the most expensive steak was a ribeye for $35? But I tell you the Picanha and then the steak salad with chimichurri??!! & provoletta cheese??!! --perfection. Came for date night bc it was highly recommended. Ambiance is just right, its festive with people but without music blasting over conversation, the servers and our waiter was friendly and kind... I wasn't expecting much in terms of service especially for a table in the middle of Little Haiti. So it was very nice to have pleasant demeanors all around. It was busy on a Friday night but didnt have to wait long for a table (without a reservation). The place is bigger than it looks from the outside but still cozy. Parking was kind of backed up so we parked across the street at the supermarket. I dont have Argentinian food often, but when I say its so flavorful its really bursting with flavor til the very last bite! Such a lovely place, a new-to-me favorite. Miami needs more decent evenings like this!",
      "Feels like a Sunday in el bajo at a cantina by the river with family and friends.Authentic Argentine fare from provoleta (so hard to find here) to papa fritas a la Provençal. Quilmes included.It's loud it's fun it's very Porteño. And the prices are súper accesible.They finally changed the funky portrait of Messi wall mural!! Love this spot",
      "Sitting in this place just transports me back to Baires. From the Mollejas, to the salsa Provençal to the bread and salpicón, the Quilmes and entraña, napolitana and fritas... everything about this place just reeks of Sunday afternoon at the Quinta In family with a smoking parillada.It feels like home.Nothing fancy. Bare essentials but memorabilia is enough to send your imagination reminiscing about El Clarin for Quino o Mafalda. The food is for the discerning parillero, the vibe a típico cantina and the company tops it off.That painting of Messi though, Che dejemosnos de Joder....",
      "Che, Quino, Mafalda, Messi, y todos los grandes iconos de nuestra infancia Presente!Loved this understated, memorable and cozy cantina whose walls are conversation starters and take you down memory lane.Reminds me of El Obrero from San Telmo in its rawness, frankness, and no fuss good asado.All the Argie fare is here. Even provoleta ... with chorizó wha?? The place transports you to Sunday's parrillada with the family after un partido and your team won ... or lost.., and you celebrated or swallowed it down with damajuanas, fritas, mollejas, chori pan and entraña.Totally enjoyed it and was great to be around Paisanos.Love the Messi de Fiorito mural...Will be back  soon!",
      "Very much like the reviews stated. A good hole in the wall!! Had a lovely night in this small but cozy restaurant. We came in with no reservation and we got sat immediately thats a plus ! Parking is valet only, not a problem really for $5. The service is dissatisfying. The servers were clearly over sat, they had way to may tables and were tuning every where. We tried to get salt and it took a good 5-10 mins for just to get the attention of the server which we never got, we got someone else to help us. This is a management problem our server was actually good and fast just had toooo many tables. We ordered for apps: Chorizo, Morcilla sampler : such good quality overall, perfectly cooked and the cabbage that came with it was the perfect mouthwatering amount of acid to cut through all the fat. Sweetbreads : these came with mash and tomato pico. The sides were tasty , the sweetbreads were over cooked and too dry. They also had no salt at all. Octopus: another delicious dish! The octopus was perfectly soft and tender, the sauce was yummy and a solid pairing. Wish there was more of this! For the entrees: Ribeye : lovely med rare, HAD NO SALT. I had to drown it when I finally got the salt. Really good sear on it , great crustNy York: perfect rare, just no sear on the steak.also no salt on the steak. Is this a policy of the restaurant or just a mistake ??? Churrasco delicious but again no salt. The chimi was fresh and balanced. They know how to make good chimi!!! The grilled veggies were delightful and refreshing to cut all the meat and potatoes. Lovely time and lovely place for a casual nice meal",
      "Oh god what could I say about this place. My favorite Argentinian in miami. Best cuts of meat cooked to perfection. Fish is great and the pasta dishes are delicious. Love this place and love every thing about it.",
      "This Argentine steakhouse is all that is advertised and more!We showed up on a weekday night and were seated immediately. They have a parking lot in the back, but it is very tight, so parking is by valet ($5).To start, we received water (in a nice glass jar) and bread (which came with both butter and salsa). Additionally, we ordered a Beet Salad to share, which was refreshing and delicious.However, the star of the show is definitely the steak. I had the churrasco (skirt steak), which I would highly recommend. It is market price and was $32 for me. We also ordered flap steak, lamb ragu with pappardelle, and grilled salmon. Everyone was really satisfied with their dishes, so I don't think you can go wrong. The waiters are also very helpful if you are having trouble deciding what to order.For dessert, we had the flan, which was a great way to finish off the night.The place is a bit pricy, but it's worth it, especially if you are celebrating something.",
      "Service was awesome. Food was outstanding. Appetizer was grilled octopus. Entree was Churrasco steak. Decor honors Fiorito, a great soccer player.  Parking lot was valet, very tight.  Don't let the neighborhood scare you.  Really enjoyed my evening."

      "Great Christmas Eve experience! If you have to be out of town on Christmas Eve for work (we work in the airline industry),  there's nowhere that could possibly make you feel more welcome than Fleming's on Brickell.The food was amazing - those Fleming's potatoes should be put in a potato hall of fame - but it was the service that was most remarkable.From the moment we walked in the door (our entire flight crew of 6), we were greeted warmly and enthusiastically.We couldn't have been luckier than to have Blanca as our server - just the right amount of humor and wit - I'd go back just for her!Everything our crew ordered - Fleming's potatoes, Brussels sprouts, sautéed mushrooms, onion rings, asparagus, filet mignon, salmon, lobster, shrimp diablo - was flawlessly prepared and amazing.As stuffed as we were after dinner, Blanca somehow managed to get us to order desserts - carrot cake, cheesecake, chocolate gooey butter cake, and creme brule - and we wolfed down every bite - they were simply amazing.Thank you Fleming's and Blanca, for making us feel cared for and loved as we  spend the Christmas holiday on the road.",
      "This was a very strong 4. Really a great overall experience. The staff was attentive and friendly. Good interaction and waitress was helpful with the menu. Food. Absolute star. My recent experience at steakhouses has been that the steaks haven't stood out. This was not the case here. I ordered the strip medium rare and it was cooked perfectly. It was a large cut and the salty peppery char was amazing. I've eaten at a lot of steakhouses and this strip was as good as any. I would 100% order this steak again. A few more thoughts on food...Onion rings- Insanely good. Huge chunks that were crispy and the sauce on the side was like a sriracha aioli on steroids. Asparagus- usually bland at most steakhouses these were seasoned well but not overall salted or cooked. Just right. Calamari- this was really good as the added peppers and onions elevated the dish. Would order this and all of the items again. Red Wine- ordered a bottle of Quilt. A Napa Cab on the recommendation of the waitress and it was a perfect pairing with the meal. Enjoyed the experience and would recommend it and go back again.",
      "First off... yesss!!! First time coming to a Flemings restaurant and they didn't miss. When we arrived for our reservation, the kind hostess gave us options for seats which was nice. It wasn't too busy and she was very accommodating. Andy was our server and was a gem. He explained the menu well and even brought a few glasses of brut to celebrate my recent milestone. Very kind! The manager came and checked on us and the rest of the staff was also on point. The location is right in downtown Brickell - right next to my office. I can see this being a popular location for corporate patrons in the area. I'm not sure about parking options but it didn't appear to be many - although there seemed to be a valet option around the corner. Not sure if this is available to Fleming's patrons or not.The food and server were equally stand out. We started with the calamari to share and it came with warm bread and two types of gourmet butters. Delicious! Next we're the steaks, which were cooked to perfection, the Brussel sprouts with bacon, and Mac and cheese. Everything was a winner!I'd recommending this Flemings location to anyone in the Brickell area looking for good food, good service, and an awesome experience.",
      "Third time coming to Fleming's here in Miami and I must say it does not disappoint. Every time we crave steak we end up at Fleming's. The staff and the service is awesome, the ambiance is very Miami and the steaks keep us coming back! Can't wait till we return.",
      "Stopped by Fleming's once again! Another fantastic and enjoyable dinner. We had a glass of wine and this steak for 2 with the Cesar salad, we love to keep it simple. Never disappoints. Thank you Fleming's for an amazing dinner and over the top service.",
      "Let's start off by saying I love Fleming's! I've been to the one in New Jersey and other locations. This was a great experience. Our server was Pedro and he was fantastic, he was kind and went above and beyond in order for us to have the best experience. We started off with the shrimp cocktail which was fresh and delicious. Their bread was warm and the pumpkin spiced butter was out of this world. For the main course we had the New York strip and the Prime Dry-Aged Ribeye which were both cooked to perfection. I can't say this enough I love Fleming's and the ambiance to this location is very hip and fun! can't wait to return and hope you're lucky enough to have Pedro as your server!",
      "Nice, quality place to dine anytime. They have a couple private rooms, so this is a go to when I need to coordinate corporate lunches and dinners. Their service and food are excellent.",
      "In my humble opinion, this is the best chain steak house. I went here after a sporting event, we were seated right away, and the service was incredible. Our server, Julio was world class and made sure we were well taken care of. I had the filet mignon and it was charred on top and tender inside. A perfectly cooked steak. The server was able to suggest a wine that paired perfect with my meal and the mash potatoes I had with the steak was just the right consistency. We sat outside on a busy night and took advantage of the December Miami weather. I shared a creme brûlée with my girlfriend and it was incredible. I should of mentioned before that they make their butter in house. Great restaurant, and I will be back.",
      "This place is simply amazing! The food, ambience and service were impeccable! I treated my daughter for her 10th birthday and we truly enjoyed everything with the exception of the area where they sat us at which is considered the \"lounge area\" not sure why when we had reservations made prior, It didn't feel like we were apart of the main dining area. My server was awesome and attentive. We had the CERTIFIED ANGUS BEEF RIBEYE $55 with JUMBO LUMP CRAB MEAT over the top ($15 extra), a side order of CHIPOTLE CHEDDAR MAC & CHEESE $14 and my daughter had the FILET MIGNON and STEAK FRIES $25 from the children's menu along with the Flemings salad and cheesecake for dessert and it was cooked to perfection, she really enjoyed it. Parking: They have a parking garage along side the restaurant, I paid $10 for approximately 2/3 hours, not bad.",
      "Fleming's was wonderful! We started things off with salads - I ordered the Wedge, smothered in Bleu and other yummy toppings. We then were brought our main courses, various steaks, onion rings, Mac & cheese, Fleming's potatoes, and sautéed mushrooms. Delicious!! Our steaks: Prime Dry-Aged Ribeye and the Prime New York Strip. Our waitress asked if we were celebrating any occasion and after revealing that we were celebrating a birthday, they offered us a dessert of our choosing on the house! The birthday boy picked the Chocolate Gooey Butter Cake for dessert!  yummmmyyyy!I highly recommend getting a reservation, although they did not seem overly busy.  Definitely snag a glass of Catena Malbec  it paired well with the New York Strip.",
      "I'd like to start by saying that this place is amazing! and beautifully decorated as you'd expect from a five star restaurant. Personnel is very friendly and as expected can count of waiter, waitress or in our case bartenders will manage you dining experience to perfection.We didn't have reservations and it being Friday evening there wasn't any available seating so we accepted to sit at the bar. They have a great wine selection and was happy that bartender let us try a couple of different wines before making our selection to a bottle of Belle & Goss Pinot Noir.I ordered the 12 oz. aged deep rubbed ribeye and two sides of Brussels sprouts Flemings potatoes that was very delicious. For dessert we shared the carrot cake and it was amazing. Overall left restaurant happy after an amazing meal. Hope to be back at this place soon.",
      "UPSCALE STEAKHOUSE located in BRICKELL.With Aged prime beef and good seafood.GOOD ATMOSPHERE!. Place is pretty new, nice decorations and big wine selection. They have very innovative cocktails as well.I would say priced accordingly for your typical Miami Steakhouse/ fine dining experience. Highlights:I had the lobster bisque ( on the thicker side, chunks of lobster on the inside, just a bit salty). The CRAB CAKES were Perfect! ( recommend ) The lobster Mac and cheese was also one of my favorites ( creamy and cheesy ). SO SO: Service was ok, but the food took long to arrive and the waiter took long to greet and bring drinks.Steak was good but had a little too much fat for my liking. But it was eatable ( was also cooked perfect ). The lobsters were very small for price... ( taste was ok ) MUST GET:For dessert you can't miss with the creme brûlée. For the most part it was good experience, food was good. Well recommended for any occasion or simply a night out on the town."

Incredible. - Tiramisu OMG - get it. - Tableside Caesar - Very nice server - Ben - Foccacia bread The good: - Meatball App - The wine cellar and steak presentation as you walk in is a nice touch General feedback: - Dimming the lights a bit more would give it some real ambiance and a homier feel  - They JUST opened so cut the staff some slack. I've been on a team opening a restaurant before and it's so hard. They did great! - Good location - easy access with ample parking. A local steakhouse is just what the neighborhood needs - The staff was really sweet and everyone was really working hard all night.",
      "Went here for a birthday dinner. They have a great menu with all sorts of selections.  Our waiter was pushy and rude.  We ordered a NY Strip, Branzino, Pasta Bolonaize, Filet Minan, truffle fries and salad.  The steaks were ordered medium well done.  All the food was good except the steaks.  They kept bringing back the steaks rare and the waiter was angry with nasty comments toward us.  If you go here avoid this guy.  We told the mgr who seemed surprised.",
      "The staff and Marco was amazing! The food, absolutely Devine, the portion the flavor, the attention to detail were all perfection. Thank you for making my husband's 40th bday so memorable.",
      "Hello my name is Nick. Of course I'm from New York. I usually don't write reviews specially bad ones we got to this nice restaurant very gorgeous inside. The bread was delicious. I have to say the first course was a pasta dish we split. It had a Bolognese sauce on it it was served hot and good. Little did I know that was the highlight of a dinner. My steak came out first they cut it up which I wasn't crazy about but it was cold. my friends ordered a veal dish a special order. They accommodated them but the dish also was ice cold. The dish presentation was very nice but it being cold was definitely a problem. I must mention the sides to twice cook baked potato was a baked potato not twice cooked. The cream spinach was nice fresh baby spinach sautéed with melted cheese on top. The menu, said cream of spinach. I do wish they would get their act together, and I would even consider trying it again. The Decour is very elegant. It was Christmas Eve. We got there at 6:15 and it wasn't that busy. There was no excuse for the cold food. I must say I was very disappointed. My name is nick hogan.",
      "Nice bar.  Quality food.   Good service    Except bartender Angie.  Good wine and liquor selection",
      "Great new restaurant. Not crowded yet. We got frutti dimare and branzino, both dishes were excellent. I especially liked that unlike many other places they go easy on a salt. Highly recommend!",
      "Rippoff stupid place out of place Does not belong among working class neighborhood Just close down and go to Ball Harbor",
      "Ridiculous prices for a basic Italian restaurant It will never make it in NMB Will not bring lunch customers at this prices Dinner customers will go to a well known reliable restaurant",
      "My boyfriend and I had been waiting for what felt like an eternity for this place to open because we love Frank so we had to check out a place named after his iconic song. Just like his song, our experience was great! The place feels intimate and has a great ambiance for a date night. The food was also incredible! Yet, the best part was the service. Our server Andrea was so sweet and helpful the entire night. I highly recommend!",
      "One of the most authentic Italian restaurants I've ever eaten at!  First rate and class-  Look forward to having many more meals at My Way!  Thanks to the incredible staff for an incredible evening.",
      "Perfect place for date night! The food was amazing and the staff very friendly and attentive. Can not go wrong with the BURRATA CAPRESE for starter and my favorite the FILETTO DI MANZO! So many tasty options can't wait to go back next time I am in town!"

      "Seaspice was amazing. It's a fantastic restaurant with a great view right on the Miami River. If you don't right you can catch the live music as the sun sets, and the restaurant transforms to a lounge. Totally worth coming Parking is tricky, and if you're not paying attention you might miss it as you drive by. But it's a gem worth coming back to.",
      "Seaspice is known to Miami locals as a very high end resturant, frequented by celebrities.  I have no idea why.  The service is pretty awful.  The drink runners are horrible.  It takes about 30 minutes for just a drink to be brought out to you.  The food is mediocre.  It is definitely NOT worth the price, which is very expensive.  I am giving two stars because the view is amazing.  Seaspice is right on the water and has a gorgeous ambiance.  You can watch yachts drive by and some will even pull up and park.  The other star is for the tres leches.  This dessert was AMAZING, I would go back just to eat it again.  But otherwise, Seaspice is nothing special.  Save your money.",
      "A place that tries to be high end but fails to deliver.Service ? Mediocre Food ? Below parFirst thing when you check in is they tell you that you have a 2 hr max(tacky)",
      "I read this was one of the best patio dining AND a hot spot for celebrities in Miami, so I had to go check it out on our recent travels to this area...Initially I was worried about our luggage situation, as we had to carry our luggage to the restaurant since this was our last stop in Miami. However, they were very accommodating, and let us store some of our stuff in the closet, and we kept the big luggage with us, near our table.As expected, the patio scene was spectacular...city skyline and seaside views, with plenty of yachts passing by! The place indeed had that chic celebrity vibe...truly FAB! Loved the music overhead as well. Somehow, I expected some snobbiness...but not at all. Service was great!Then the food. OMFG...I've had some amazing foods lately, but this takes the cake. Even the complimentary bread was amazing (and unique)! My husband ordered this Wagyu Burger, and I chose this Ragu Pappardelle ( THE best Ragu Pappardelle I've ever had...EVER. ). Then this Pavola dessert...again, just beyond delish. Truly, this was foods for the celebrities.Honestly, I'm shocked at how low the rating is for this place. I assume that if the service isn't top notch, it would probably piss some folks off. The pricing was on the outlandish side...with even lunch entrees starting at around 40. There was even an appetizer item priced at around 70 bucks! Luckily, like I said, I felt that the foods and the service (and especially the spectacular ambiance) made up for it. There was this big yacht parked right near us, which somewhat blocked some of the views from the left. Still, we got our eyeful of seaside/yachtside views.In any case, this was a great way to end our trip in Miami.",
      "Went here with a group of girlfriends for brunch and everything was delicious, they were super accommodating as well.I had the froze , a cucumber and gin cocktail and 2 grey goose and sodas and all were fantastic.As a table we split the fresh fish and a couple sides and it was delicious. Also love the free bread It is definitely on the pricier side overall tbh but great for a fun \"fancy\" brunch",
      "Came here for Miami spice and although we spent more than we thought we would, we had a good time. Everything was delicious. The kale Caesar had pecans and Granny Smith apple slices, never had a Caesar like this but it was a nice change! The Shrimp Pesto Whole Wheat Spaghetti was my favorite, even though I'm not the biggest fan of pesto. The burger was good too just a little messy from the truffle aioli. The chocolate cremoso and tres leches was very good but I'd go with the cremoso for the cocoa nib crumble, yum! All in all, I think it's overpriced and I probably won't come here again because of that. The cheapest bottle of Chardonnay was $75 and most drinks were $20. I only came here for Miami spice and still spent almost $200.",
      "Given we still have Miami Spice going on until the end of the month we decided to try out the lunch menu @ Seaspice gorgeous location on the Miami River, sitting outdoor is really relaxing, so beautiful to watch the boats go by, really lovely To start we had the Comte' Cheese Soufflé, I have to admit this was a bit disappointing, it really did not have the texture of a real soufflé  but then............ the Shrimp Pesto Whole Wheat Spaghetti and the Pan-Seared Chilean Seabass were really good as dessert, both the Tres Leches and the Chocolate Cremoso were yummy Try it out before Miami Spice ends, you can check out the Miami Spice Menus on miamiandthebeaches.com@seaspicemia",
      "First time for me at Seaspice, it is located on the banks of the Miami River it is a gem that you should not miss. Sit outside in the courtyard enjoy your food and a drinks while watching the boats go by, just beautiful We had the Miami Spice lunch which has a very affordable fix price 3 course menu for $ 28, unfortunately this will end soon, nevertheless, I would defiantly go back again for sureRegarding the Miami Spice menu only one observation, they should have had more than one choice for the Entrees without the extra charge, right now you have 4 choices and 3 of these have extra charge on it, not really fair given that you are promoting the Spice menu, you should have at least two or three choices included in the price and one or two with the extra charge We had had Prince Edward Island Mussels, Grilled, the Grilled Faroe Island Salmon and the Profiteroles and Peaches and Cream. My favorite where the Mussels, the garlic pizza bread they brought for the table was absolutely delicious, the Salmon was good too. I had the Peaches for dessert and it was ok, not really my thing, my friend said the Profiteroles were great, next time I will not opt for the healthy dessert We enjoyed all with a good Albariño wine, our experience was made especially enjoyable by our waiter Fabrizio, he was really great ! Thank you Fabrizio @seaspicemia",
      "Bad first impression. Its not a nice feeling to feel like you have to beg to spend your money at a restaurant. Every year I look forward to Miami Spice. It's a great way to try out various restaurants and a unique spread of menu options. Seaspice was on my radar and happened to be one of the participating restaurants offering the Miami Spice menu. I contacted the restaurant in advance and made a reservation for 3:30p for a party of four. My mom who is from out of town was excited to join us for lunch. I advised the restaurant we were doing the Miami Spice menu. The restaurant made it clear that they charge $50pp for No Shows. At 3:15pm, we arrived for our reservation. The hostess Karin greeted us, and advised us that they were running behind on the reservations and because of this they will not be able to offer the Miami Spice menu. Only the a la-carte menu will be offered. This was a bit upsetting because we drove almost an hour to get there and the restaurant is refusing to offer the Miami Spice promotion. Our natural instinct was to just say forget it we will go somewhere else. I mean, at the end of the day who wants to beg to spend their money? It's absurd. If the restaurant is offering a promotional menu and because to no fault of our own they are running behind why should we be penalized?My Mom looked so bummed out. Because she was so excited to try this place. I decided to walk back in and ask for a Manager. The Manager took 20min to come out. When he finally did come over, he introduced himself as Collin. I explained to him what was going on and it seemed as though he wasn't aware that the hostesses were turning Miami Spice customers away. He decided to make it right and advised Karin to honor the Miami Spice menu. Impressive! Things were turning around. Besides the encounter at the hostess stand, the restaurant is beautiful. It is situated on Miami's waterfront were you can view the million dollar yachts passing by. They also have docks for those interested in docking and dining. You can view the downtown city skyline which I am sure looks amazing at night.The food was excellent. The Miami Spice menu offered a three course lunch for $28. You have the choice of a starter (Kale Salad, Cheese Souffle, or White Gazpacho). A choice of entrees (Seabass, Chicken Breast, Shrimp Pesto Pasta, Wagyu Burger, or Plant Bowl). And a choice of dessert (Tres Leches or Chocolate Cremoso). They also offer the option to add a Glass of wine for and additional $12. I ordered the Comte Cheese Souffle, the Green Circle Farms Chicken Breast, and the Tres Leches. The others in my party ordered the Kale Salad, Gazpacho, and Seabass. For starters, My favorites were the Kale Caesar Salad and Cheese Souffle. The Kale Caesar had a mix of shredded Granny Smith apples, pecans and a creamy Caesar dressing. The cheese Souffle was like a fluffy egg Souffle with a cream parmesan sauce and tomato chutney. Delicious!For entrees, both the Seabass and Chicken breast were amazing. The Chicken breast was tender and juicy, served on top of a creamy polenta and topped with corn, peas, and mushrooms. The seabass was seared nicely to give a nice crunch on the outside, while perfectly flaky and moist on the inside. It was served with stewed garbanzo, Swiss chard, and smoked potato. For desserts, we all had Tres Leches. It was served in a small Mason jar topped with 3 milks, and berries. Perfect way to end the meal. The portions are not large but it is filling. The flavors are fresh and very well balanced. The food presentation was notable. The Watermelon Tequila drink was delightful and refreshing. The froze was also a big hit. The cocktails were presented well and created perfectly. We enjoyed everything. Our waiter, Austin was very friendly. He made great recommendations and was very attentive.An 18% gratuity was added to the tab. There are lots of street parking accessible. In the end, the food was great. Ambience was amazing. The hostesses can use additional customer service training and learn to use better judgment to improve the customers experience. There was no need to escalate the matters to a manager. It could have been handled properly by showing empathy, apologizing, and finding a solution to the problem.",
      "Hi Kim,Thank you for dining with us and leaving a detailed review. It has been forwarded to our management team. Our apologies for the confusion at the door.  Glad to hear Collin accommodated you and your experience was turned around.  We are happy to see your great feedback regarding the food, cocktails, and Austin’s Service.  Hopefully you will join us again in the near future!",
      "This is my second time going to sea spice & I normally love it as the first time. I never leave bad reviews But this second time MY PHONE WAS STOLEN AND SECURITIES DID NOThing about it. Instead we're trying to blame me for the situation. I'm not drunk nor was drunk. I walked in with 2 phone and walked out with 1.We came as my friend USUALLY does and this is how they treated us  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME. I thought it was 5 star so nothing could go wrong. With a security right next to our table my phone STILLL got stolen. It was on the table. And to whoever has the time to steal phones is just sad imagine what else they can steal... I wil ask to review cameras but with the way I was treated when I let them know I lost my phone I doubt they will be helpful but I'll let every platform form of review know that they steal phones here. I know the exact time frame as well so they wouldn't even have to look much at the cameras. Let's see. BTW I BEEN HOME SICK AFTER EATING THESE OYSTERS I COULDNT Even celebrate my baby's birthday w him.",
      "Came here for my birthday dinner with my boyfriend for a 7:15 reservation (we called in advance for an outdoor seat dock side) we waited about ten minutes after our arrival for our table to be ready at the bar, the short wait was definitely worth it. Started with an aperol spritz at the bar then ordered octopus and gazpacho to start. Octopus portion was good but the olive oil tasted burnt since it came out on a sizzling hot cast iron looking skillet (its very easy to overcook octopus, please just bring a regular plate next time.) I also had the whole main lobster. Extremely delicious large portion of perfectly cooked and seasoned lobster, bravo. My boyfriend had the truffle coated Chilean sea bass and he absolutely loved it. Vibe: 5/5 this place definitely is a scene but not overwhelmingly pretentious or obnoxious. Absolutely loved the music as well. Service:3/5 A bit slow, our server was very attentive when we were able to get his attention but we had to always wave him down. Food: 4/5 everything was honestly pretty good (octopus could've had a bit more attention to detail)",
      "Hi Liz,Thank you for celebrating your birthday with us!  We are so happy to hear you had a great experience and enjoyed the food.  Your feedback regarding the octopus has been sent to our chef. We look forward to seeing you again soon!"

      "Went to Niu Wine Bar and had a great night. Shannon was an excellent host recommending menu items and paired wines for us. The food and wine were all excellent and it felt like we were the only people at the bar/restaurant. The ham+cheese board, tomato salad, and potatoes were my favorite. Can't wait to come back.",
      "The food was VERY good. The service started off very nice, the server was attentive to our questions, helped with our drink selection, recommended a variety of dishes popular in the restaurant (we ordered based on her suggestions, and they were all good). After ordering the meal, however, we felt the server kind of forgot about us, the attention wasn't the same.The food came very quickly (we felt maybe too much at first), but the pace actually felt nice, cause we shared everything we ate, so we could focus our attention on one dish at a time. But after having the main course, there was a big pause and wait to order the dessert, we kind of disrupted the pace of the entire meal.This is me just being picky, we actually had a great time, the food was amazing and it's good to know a have a good place nearby to eat, have a drink, share small plates. It's good for any occasion.First Course | Classic spanish tomato bread 4 / 5First Course | Branzino Tartare with White Garlic Cold Soup 5 / 5Main Course | Arros Sec with Botifarra Sausage & Aïoli  4 / 5 (this one was very good, but to my personal taste, it needed a little bit more of an aggressive seasoning to just make it explode with flavor, perhaps just a bit more salt, or just some citrus zest/just) Main Course | Grilled Artichoke Confit & Jamón Ibérico 5 / 5 (maybe needed just a pinch of salt).Dessert | Milk Bread, Crema Catalana & Lime Ice Cream 5 / 5 (do not change this dish, do not take it off the menu).",
      "The wines recommended by our server were really great. The small plates were generally better than the larger ones. The octopus was my best. I am really not a fan of the paella. We shouldn't have ordered the desserts...",
      "Food was definitely good, however the overall service execution left more to be desired. First, when we were sat, we waited ten minutes for any waiter to pay us any attention. Music was so loud too at the beginning, no one at the table could hear our waiter. Now onto food: - We started off with the tomato bread and iberico ham (not pictured). Very good. - We then had the anchovies, good but 17 dollars for 4 anchovies that comes with no bread feels like a crime. Add an extra 2 bucks to the dish and give me some bread if you have to. - The steak tartare was good, nothing amazing, but the crackers it came with instantly break when you put the tartare on top. - Octopus was delicious, no complaints. - Clams (not pictured) were great and different than other clams I've had, love the slight vinegar kick in the sauce. Ordered bread to come to clean up all the sauce. But had to ask twice if the bread was coming. - Ous was delicious, can really taste the truffle, but they give you so little bread,  we had to order more.- Bavette steak (not pictured) was delicious as well. Perfectly cooked and really tender, would definitely recommend. - Seafood Paella (not pictured) was way too salty. Seafood was perfectly cooked though and rice texture was decent, wish there was some socarrat at the bottom though.- Cuttlefish, they forgot about this dish and when I asked if it was coming, they said they'd go check, and never got back to us. All in all, food was good, but portions were small, which would've been fine, if the service was attentive and it felt like we were being taken care of. Not one to highlight price in a review, however in this case, I expect a decent service and for dishes to feel complete. Not sure if I would go back but I'm on the fence.",
      "Nice place! Really lovely owner/staff, great wine selection.",
      "This place is nothing short of amazing. We ordered a little bit of everything, and not one thing was bad. Everything was outstanding. My favorites were Ous Poach Egg, Pan Con Tomate, Octopus Carpaccio and the duck. I will definately be coming back",
      "Omg so delicious - What a little treat tucked away in Downtown Miami! I've been in the area SO SO SO Often (literally across the street at Epicurean) and had no idea this masterpiece was lurking in the shadows! We did family style and it did not disappoint! Our server was amazing, we sat outside and luckily had a breezy Miami night! Wine flowed, conversation stimulated and every bite made the experience more magical! Branzino - my favOysters!!!!!Both are amazing! Raw and the charbroiled Salad- perfect addition Pan de tomate - absolutely nailed itOctopus carpaccio - amazingCannolini - a bit salty Ous- get it but only 1 for the table Steak tartare - skipFoie gras- skipOverall, NIU is a MUST",
      "Let me start off by saying that driving to downtown Miami is like taking a baby trip for us. It's a pain to park, traffic stinks, bla bla bla... this gem has a parking lot behind the restaurant and that merits an automatic 10 stars! Niu is a cozy restaurant with the best playlist and a cool ass hip amazing staff. Our server suggested we try a bunch of small plates. Clams were amazing. Loved! The chicken caloned were delicious cheesiness. Paella was very good- my daughter liked it a lot. The potato egg foam thing is a must. So yummy! Now the star of the show was the charbroiled oysters. OH MY GOD! It was like a baby piece of heaven. At $7 a pop, they are not cheap, but once you pop you can't stop! So amazing!!! The gelato was heaven on earth part 2. Highly recommend NIU. I'd drive out of my jurisdiction all day long just to come here again.",
      "We celebrated a friend's birthday dinner here last night & it was such fun! We were a large-ish, extremely boisterous & rather demanding (sowee)  group of 8 but our phenomenal waiter, Chris, took excellent care of us, all while remaining cool & collected & looking extremely handsome!We ordered some of everything it felt like. Because I don't eat meat or pork or cephalopods or foie gras, there was quite a bit I didn't try but highlights were the Pa Amb Tomàquet (pan con tomate was outstanding!), oysters (both raw and charbroiled at the table with a glowing ember), were some of the best oysters i've EVER had, & i've had A LOT of oysters in my day! The other standout was the Branzino Tartare (White garlic cold soup, cucumber, quince) an absolute STAR! The flavours were soooo beautiful. The Canelons (Roasted chicken cannelloni, wonton, bechamel, grated Manchego) were yummy and definitely satisfying.  The Glóries Salad (Greens, tomato, apple, onion, mozzarella, black olives, pesto) was good but nothing spectacular. All innall it was a fantastic time & I can't wait to return. So great to see nightlife in Downtown Miami alive & thriving on a Thursday night! Very much looking forward to spending more time in this area.",
      "What a unique find in downtown Miami! This Catalan small plate specialist is not to be missed. The small contemporary digs provide a nice atmosphere; it's just trendy enough without the flash that seems to permeate the Miami scene. The lovely server brought multiple samples of wine by the glass before my husband and I both settled on a Spanish rose. As luck would have it, the only remaining bottle in house provided one full glass and about 3/4 of a second serving. Our waitress was apologetic and stated that she would be charging us only for one glass. Now that's good business sense! We started with the octopus carpaccio and branzino tartare in a chilled garlic soup. Both were well balanced and bursting with unique flavors that all just worked.  We then enjoyed the large white asparagus which were so supple in texture and simply refreshing and delicious. On to the coca flatbread which was a crispy toast with tuna belly dotted with anchovies and romesco. The presentation was gorgeous and tasty. The artichoke with foam and jamon Iberico was a standout. We finished with a whole dorado presented and then filleted and served over crispy thinly sliced wafers of potato. The fish was cooked to perfection, despite a pretty imperfect fillet job which looked a bit sloppy and left several bones when served. All in all though the service, food and vibe were so enjoyable. I recently gave another casual eatery in Miami 5 stars and if you read my other reviews, it is quite clear I don't easily dole out the highest rating. But NIU kitchen deserved it. The menu is really interesting and provides ample options for all palates. Highly recommend trying if you haven't had the pleasure of dining here yet."

      "We stopped by Stiltsville Fish bar for lunch yesterday. We took advantage of the  weather and we're seated outside. We started our lunch with a couple Hotel Nacional drinks, which we recommend! We had the conch fritters as appetizers. Very tasty and came with a wonderful sauce.We went with and shared the crispy whole fish - a 2 pound yellow snapper - as our main entree'. Dessert was the key lime pie. All of the staff were extremely friendly. Our server Maria was also great; no waiting for food to drive.Maria helped us select the best fish for our entrees' , bringing her recommended fish to our table.Everything was great. The snapper was really well cooked and the salsa verde sauce was delicious. I'd highly recommend anyone going to Stiltsville Fish Bar to go with the whole fish.Only downside is that they don't offer the Tuna Ceviche during lunch",
      "Great job Monica !Delicious food with interesting twists.Very fresh , lots of flavor",
      "Had the best experience at SFB! Obviously used Yelp for reviews prior to our visit. The pictures of the Sweet Corn Spoon Bread had me drooling. Did not make a reservation & had no issue being accommodated at the table we desired. Was graciously greeted by Jon, who was beyond an excellent server & wonderful guide through the menu. We sat outside and it was the perfect blend of intimate seating while still being able to talk to people passing by. The interior was clean and inviting too! After listening to our likes & dislikes, Jon encouraged me to try the large Stone Crab Claws & they were  AMAZING! He also suggested the Seared Tuna which was so fresh. It came with a side of Pineapple Fried Rice which was great as well. We ordered the Asparagus side which we could have done without, it did not stand out like the rest of the meal did. For dessert, we received a delicious slice of Key Lime Pie. What an amazing finish! Thank you Jon!Parking is available ina public lot across the street. There is also plenty of street parking as well. It was easy to navigate to & there were helpful directions available on their website. BONUS: they have the best homemade coconut lime sugar scrub in the bathroom! They also sell jars of it next to the bar!",
      "Great service and good food. A large group of us came so we were able to try a bunch of dishes, including some happy hour dishes. I got to try the buffalo fish wings, smoked fish dip, deviled eggs & caviar, chilled watermelon & pickle salad, conch fritters, stone crabs, sweet corn spoon bread, and a roasted whole fish. I recommend the buffalo fish wings, and sweet corn spoon bread. The buffalo fish wings were different, nicely fried and something to try at least once. There is little meat though and I don't recommend it if you are uncomfortable with eating fish bones (these are edible and so are the fins). The sweet corn spoon bread was delicious; so light, fluffy and flavorful. Everything else was pretty good. I would skip the deviled eggs & caviar (nothing special).I also enjoyed all the cocktails I had: sunset harbor, hotel nacional and landmark highball.Happy hour is weekdays 3-7pm and they offer $8 stone crabs during happy hour on Thursdays only. Our server Jonathan was great, attentive, and gave great recommendations. Don't forget to check-in on yelp for a free glass of wine.",
      "Pulled up here for HH.  I was one of their first guests for HH, the place was mostly empty to which I was delighted because I was hoping to avoid a crowd lol.I was allowed to sit wherever I pleased and settled in the corner with a little view outside.I was impressed by the menu and couldn't wait to try a few items out.I stated off with the oysters, they were so darn good that I ordered another round lol.  They were incredibly fresh and the mignonette was perfect.  I gave the smoked fish dip a try and wasn't disappointed.  The homemade potato chips were as good as I had hoped for and paired very well with the dip.The crab slider was a 10/10.  It wasn't full of filler and was worth every little bite.Idr what I had for a drink but I remember enjoying it, especially bc I was hesitant since egg foam was involved.I would absolutely return and recommend that you give this place a try too!",
      "Beer was excellent, oysters were okay, pasta for the kids okay, watermelon salad nothing spectacular, fried chicken was pretty good. We also had the Sundowner for two which came with some lobster, 3 oysters and tuna ceviche. Everything was all pretty okay but I don't think I would go there again. The service was pretty good and very accommodating for kids.",
      "Really enjoyed my meal here. We were celebrating my birthday and almost everything was really good. There is a parking lot across the street. The place is not located on the water however the decor is very nautical and definitely giving coast guard vibes. They honored the Yelp check in code which was great! They have a great variety of beers (including craft beers!), wines, and craft cocktails. I didn't enjoy the buffalo fish wings - it had little meat and fish bones in it, which just made the experience of eating unpleasant. My husband and I shared the carb crusted NY strip which was cooked to perfection and very good. We finished off with the coconut key lime pie which was tasty.Overall it was a good time celebrating my birthday here and would definitely come back for a special occasion.",

      "I was really looking forward to a meal at Stiltsville given all the positive reviews I read.  Sadly, I was very disappointed and definitely won't return.Firstly, service was very slow.  I understand that restaurants are short staffed lately, but there were plenty of servers for the relatively small amount of customers in the restaurant (probably 6 tables of 2).  My food came out quickly but no one checked on me until I flagged someone down for my cheque 30 minutes later. I ordered the smoked fish dip to start, which was great!  Plenty of fish and it was served with buttery saltines (not sure how they did this?) and fresh, homemade chips.  Yum!  I also ordered a crab cake.  It was $15 and was probably about 4 bites of food.  It was good and there was plenty of crab (which I always appreciate!), but the size was ridiculous.  I decided not to order a main (mostly because someone was complaining that it took 25 minutes for her salad to come out), but I ended up being glad I didn't as nothing was overly impressive.Sadly, I'd give Stiltsville a solid \"meh\" rating.",
      "Came here for my birthday and we enjoyed the food and service. Everything we ordered was delicious and fresh. Highly recommend the baked oysters! The mermaid cocktail was very refreshing.Our served brought the fish to our table to make sure it was the one we wanted. She removed the spine/bones for us. Honestly... leave the spines because when they remove it they take a good amount of meat. Street parking paybyphone.Make a reservation because it's a small restaurant."

      "Came here on a Tuesday night early enough to snag a table for two without a reservation.. I was surprised that every seat was filled by the time I left. But shouldn't be too surprised as it's 2022 in Miami, specifically south of fifth where locals and tourists alike collect for the best of Miami Beach. The ambiance at Call Me Gaby is lively and energetic, quaint yet classy, with beautiful aesthetics. Totally my type. I had an aperol spritz (duh) to go with the Andrea Pizza, fiochetti alle pere e tartufo, and was feeling adventurous so went for the spaghetti alle vongole. The pasta was all good (I have a high standard for the pear truffle fiochetti so I wasn't particularly impressed) -- but the pizza was the star of the show. They have a long menu of pizza which made my mouth water trying to choose. I was beyond happy with my choice of Andrea -- fresh stracciatella, fig jam and prosciutto.. literally what dreams are made of. From the dough to the freshness of ingredients it was perfection. Excited to return and try more + share this special place with friends.",
      "Carbone who? I feel like smaller, more family oriented Italian restaurants are sooo much better than the ones with hype and Call Me Gaby proves it. Attentive service and the food is amazing. Try a little bit of everything because the portions aren't that big!",
      "Very beautiful and inviting place. Excellent for small groups who are looking for good food and service. Our experience was wonderful and Melinda and everyone else taking care of the table were very pleasant and professional.We will definitely return. Parking is not do easy around so Ride-sharing or Valet are best to get there.",
      "Lovely atmosphere, amazing food, such cute decor! Feels like I'm in a living room. I love this vibe. The pasta and pizza are delicious. Also the burrata and bread was good too. Loved it all.",
      "A little bit of Italy in Miami beach.  Call Me Gaby is the neighborhood hotspot for romantic al fresco dining, garden aperitives, family dinners, birthday parties, and everything in between and I'm not being biased because my name is Gaby. If you like pizza, brick oven pizza and fresh ingredients and don't want to break the bank, this is the spot. That wood fire makes all the difference when it comes to pizza and these folks know the trick. We tried the \"Andrea\" smoked prosciutto and fig jam for the first pie and was not disappointed. Fresh toppings and the sweet and salty combo of the fig and prosciutto with the fresh stracciatella,  was amazing and yes we'd have to come back to try a few more pies because it was hard to pick which one to get. We also shared the Focchetti Alle Pere e Tartufo which was handmade pasta filled with Parmigiano Reggiano fondue, caramelized pear, Sage butter sauce, Aceto Balsamico and some  truffle carpaccio . If your mouth didn't just water reading that , go try it for yourself , taste even better than it reads! Is it a coincidence that Coco Chanel's real name was Gaby? Elegance, enchantment, and classic style? I think not.",
      "Everyone raves about this restaurant. It was decent. Loved the vibe and jazz music feeling. Was a beautiful night to sit outside. Supposedly ,there is an adult spot upstairs but we had kids with us so we couldn't go up. Food was ok. Nothing I had stood out to me. I may revisit just to see if it was an off night but not rushing too. I don't even remember what I ate which for a foodie is not good",
      "Location is pretty, food is good but very expensive for what it is. Service is non-existent. Server barely engaged with us, never offered drinks, every time I was going to talk she already had one foot on a different direction as to leave asap. 20% service added to the bill which was definitely not deserved.",
      "The service here was terrible.  We came early (around 5pm) and were seated by the host at a table outside.  Although there were several servers standing around not really doing much except polishing wine glasses, we were completely ignored.  After 20 minutes of just sitting drinking water we had to get up and go ask one of them to come great our table.  We ordered right away and the food did not take very long to come out.  The food was good, but they messed up my child's order and my they would not eat it the plate as served (a simple kids pasta dish).  Of course it took another 20 minutes to get someones attention and by that time the adults were finished eating and so we just gave them the plate back and told them \"never mind, he will just eat somewhere else\".  I went to bathroom twice while I was there, once by myself and once to take my son.  The same servers who would not come take our order were just standing in the doorway blocking the path.  BOTH times I actually had to politely ask them to move out of the doorway (the front door!) just so I could walk into the restaurant (keep in mind the restaurant was less than half full at this time).  I would have let all those things go, since accidents happen, except the bill came and the server added an automatic 20% tip to our bill???  There were 3 adults and 2 small children.  I typically tip at least 20% when we eat out, as I worked in fine dining throughout most of my youth, but to add an automatic gratuity after COMPLETELY ignoring us AND messing up my children's food order is a little ridiculous.  We paid the bill and left, but we will never be back.   If you are going to add a mandatory 20%, you should train your servers to deserve that gratuity.  They clearly did not care if we were happy or not cause they knew that they would be getting paid either way.  They got a $40 tip for doing almost nothing for us, and my son left hungry.  I gave 2 Stars, because we really did enjoy the food that came out correctly, maybe just bad luck for us.",
      "We decided to come here after I was told the pizza is one of the best in Miami. This place is very nice and has a great range for celebrating any occasion from a casual lunch to a romantic date night. The place is beautiful and the decoration is inviting. The service was good and the food and drinks we had were all delicious. My only criticism would be that is overpriced in my opinion but it didn't bother me because I was aware prior to booking our reservation. Being a local from dade county, you will definitely feel the \"tourist\" or \"south beach\" tax.You can see everything we had in the pictures and I was amazed at a few dishes such as the watermelon salad and pizzas, the pizza dough and sauce is amazing  and for drinks the one in the dessert menu called gigolo was out of this world, I would drink a bucket of it if I could.Definitely a place to try. We will most likely go back to have some of their pasta dishes as they looked amazing.Also parking is a pain just like any place in south beach. They have valet parking but it wasn't available when we arrived at noon.",
      "The food here is always spectacular. Beautifully decorated. And the value for the portions is definitely one of the better restaurants in the south beach area. The only thing that is a bit annoying is the 20% gratuity automatically added to the bill. I normally tip that anyway, but then the servers sometimes request more. Seriously request it..... and that's a turn off. Other than the occasional server issue (which is all of south Florida , not just here ) the food is a must!!"

      "An incredible dinning experience.  Chef's selection Omikase was inventive and impeccable.  I particularly enjoyed the kinoko nabe, soft shelled makimono and the halibut with a shiitake mushroom crust.  Also the fried milk desert is not to be missed",
      "Uchi. Happy Hour. :)I'm so grateful that Uchi created their epic hour. Uchi, thanks for making delicious sushi accessible to more people. I've gotten really lucky and have always managed to score a seat at the bar for happy hour, though I try to time it so that I get there early in the day. I am a total sushi newbie, so I appreciate having the opportunity to spend an evening with them at the bar, learning new things and sampling different styles/offerings. I've never been for a non-Happy Hour dining experience, though I'm sure it's fabulous. It's a great location and I highly recommend checking it out!",
      "Went on a Tuesday night and the restaurant was packed, so I highly recommend reservations.  Parking can be hard to find due to the restaurants location in Wynwood. The aesthetic is beautiful with neutrals and wood tones. The tables are spaced nicely. You can't overhear other tables conversations and the spacing gives a more intimate feel. Service was great and they had a very efficient team of staff making sure every table was taken care of. Our waiter had some delicious recommendations. I highly recommend interacting with the staff to find the best dishes to try. All of the fish was fresh and cut nicely. The combinations of textures and flavors is a sensory experience that you cannot find at many sushi restaurants. If you like sushi this is a must try restaurant in south Florida.",
      "Uchi is so highly acclaimed that I had very high expectations. I went in during happy hour and ordered the following items:ichinene as my first drink - serving was basically a sample, the glass coupe came half fullHot rock wagyu - good but nothing to write home about Hamachi makimono - amazing, highly recommendPork belly - okay, tasted meatyOyster - greatG&T drink - great drinkTheir patio is dog friendly and my server Stephanie was great",
      "I would give this place a 4.5 stars. The aesthetic is great. The sushi is fresh. Service is good. Overall, no complaints.However, in terms of the \"omakase\" for the *price-to- -taste ratio* -- I am going to be honest and say that I would rather go nearby to Omakai for much more varieties of tasty sashimi/nigiri/hand-rolls included as a part of their set (as of this review Dec 2022, it is a bit more affordable too) Would I go here again? Yes, probably if any of my friends wanted to try it. If I was on my own though - I would check out the other options nearby.",
      "Food - amazing, service - amazing, ambiance - amazing. Not only is every aspect of Uchi from the interior design, to the food plating and cocktail presentation beautiful, the food is out of this world. So many unique flavors and all of the fish was so fresh. Our waiter was also great - He was super knowledgeable about the menu and provided us with the best recommendations. He did tell us that since this restaurant started in Texas, anything with short rib was phenomenal and he was absolutely right. I highly recommend going here for a nice dinner out in Wynwood.",
      "Hands down the best sushi in Miami! The service is excellent. The ambiance is excellent. The sushi is excellent. The cocktails are excellent.Always get the foie gras at the end! Must try everything in the menu. Keep up the good work",
      "My favorite restaurant in Miami! So far it's my favorite sushi restaurant EVER. The quality of the food, the art of flavors and textures! I feel at home every single time I step into uchi! The staff is absolutely amazing & inviting. My first time at uchi was extraordinary, it was just a few months after their opening and jay truly gave us an experience. We gave him a budget & he introduced us to dishes we fell in love with! We did not regret trusting him with our dinner not one bit! From the best cocktail suggestion being subarashi (which is my fav cocktail thus far) to creating a sick addiction for their gyutoro, let's not forget their Hama chili. As I'm writing this my mouth waters! Truly amazing all around! Everyone on the team is amazing, be on the look out for the greats like Gaby, Jay, & Eric *sushi bar*!!",
      "Amazing food! Went to Miami for my birthday and it did not disappoint. Our server Avery made our dinner very special. The otoro was easily the best dish. Thank you very much for the great time Avery!",
      "I don't have enough good things to say about Uchi. This Austin restaurant has opened in Wynwood Miami, and I'm so glad it did! We came early and sat at the sushi bar which is the best move. Uchi has happy hour between 5-6:30pm, which includes 1/2 price bubbles, so naturally we sat down and ordered a bottle of brut rosé. As for the food, we essentially did an unofficial omakase, leaving most of the food in the hands of the sushi chef, simply telling him that we prefer raw dishes rather than hot/cooked. We spent much of the evening talking to him and allowing him to serve us his recommendations until we were full. Everything was really incredible, topped off by the presentation and skill of the chefs. While pricey, Uchi truly earns its right to charge the prices it does. I look forward to returning here, as well as trying the companion restaurant Uchiko when it eventually comes to Miami."

      "In advance of my Miami trip I basically Googled all the Michelin Starred restaurants in this city. Boia De popped up and I was surprised by how \"affordable\" the menu was! IMMEDIATELY, I tried to book a reservation one month in advance, but found that it was not possible for a party of two. Calling the restaurant proved to be unhelpful, we were put on hold and then the call disconnected...My partner and I were still determined to eat here, so we arrived at the restaurant 5:30pm Wednesday evening. To our surprise, were seated immediately! :)Boia De serves Italian-inspired small plates (kind of like tapas) that are meant to be shared. I LOVED everything we ordered. We had 6 dishes between two persons, which was the perfect amount of food for us. Here is everything we had listed below, from most favorite to less favorite (but still very delicious) -- Tagliolini Nero: if you ordered one thing from the menu it should be this. It is recommended and mentioned in so many Michelin guides. I did not expect my favorite dish of the night to be a cold pasta! -- Potato Skins: comes with a generous serving of caviar. The perfect salty, crunchy starter. -- Beef Tartare: one of the recommended menu items. My partner was craving more flavor, but I absolutely loved the tartare. -- Marinated Mussels: served with fingerling chips on top! Mussels cooked beautifully and already out of the shell. Really creative sauces.-- Rabbit Loin: this is not on the online menu as of 11/3/2022 so it must be relatively new. Great cook but I think the protein was light on flavor for me. Last but not least, I think this deserves its own category....the Crispy Tiramisu!! DO NOT skip dessert as this was one of the best tiramisu I've ever had. The Lady Fingers are fried but the tiramisu somehow still tastes like a very light dessert. So delicious. It was my partner's favorite dish of the night. A dinner for two was around $200 including tax and tip. Not bad for a Michelin Star! The service was fantastic as well.",
      "I've been waiting to come here for so long! Even on a Wednesday night, this place was packed. Its very cute in the restaurant, and there's a small bar, but it is very small. We couldn't get a reservation, so we just showed up and were seated outside.I was so excited about my non-alcoholic drink (LOL) it was a peach iced tea that was sooo good! My friend had a mexican coke.We had a hard time deciding what to order, but our waiter was very helpful.To eat we had:-Baked clams- very good, but extremely small. would probably pass on them next time-Crispy polenta- MUST GET. Crispy, heavenly cubes with a delicious sautéed eggplant on top-Kanpachi crudo- flavor explosion in your mouth, must get-Taglioni nero- cold squid ink pasta dish. reminded me of pasta salad. very highly recommended by waiter, but i would pass next time-BUFALA RICOTTA GNOCCHI ALLA NORCINA - must get!! the gnocchi was declines covered with black truffles, we were drinking the sauce out of the bowlDessert:The carrot cake was a big slice, delicious with a scoop of ice cream on the side. WOWI will definitely come back!! Just a taddd bit expensive for certain dishes.",
      "Was very excited to try boia de as I had been here when it first opened and had a great meal. We had heard they had changed their menu and had won some amazing reviews so we were eager to see what it was all about, but unfortunately I was disappointed with the quality of the food. Hopefully they just had a bad night at the kitchen, otherwise I really don't understand why it's so hard to get a reservation here.Crispy potato skins - not crispy at all. The potatoes were  stale and even hard to chew on. As if they had been left out for hours and not fried properly. The entire dish was missing flavor and texture. Poor execution. Crispy polenta - mediocre at best. Drenched in balsamic vinegar to give it acidity. Simply not impressive.Octopus - flavor was ok. Could have had a bit more sauce to give the dish more flavor. octopus was cooked ok, but was slightly chewy.Beef tartare - another dish lacking flavor / depth. Crispy capers were not crispy at all which is what should have given all the saltiness to the dish. Cracker that came with the tartare was hard and chewy. It had a terrible texture and hard to swallow. Ribs and saffron pasta were good. Best 2 savory dishes we ordered. Ribs were properly cooked and the sauce along with the pickles gave it a good kick. Carrot cake - best dish we had all night and one of the best desserts I have ever had. Just wish the rest of the meal would have been as exciting as this dish. Sorry guys, but food was not on point last night.",
      "food was good, but definitely overhypedof everything i tried i loved the crispy polenta & the tiramisu the most. Service was great & accommodating.space was small, but not uncomfortable.",
      "Boia De is definitely a place that Miamian foodies need to try! The first time I went I was absolutely BLOWN AWAY, but the second and third time that wow factor was dulled for me. I'm not sure why, but of course, the food, ambiance, and service were still great. Dinner for two with 5 plates, a drink each, and 2 deserts came out to just under $200 pre tip, which I do think is a good value for a Michelin restaurant and for the amount which we ordered. Must tries are the steak tartare and the tagliolini nero. I also loved the Sunchoke Caramelle which is a seasonal item. The lamb ribs were also delicious. The crispy tiramisu is absolutely DELICIOUS. The carrot cake was good too but the tiramisu is even better. We were convinced to order the Rabbit Loin as it was a new item, but I really disliked this dish to the point where thinking about it makes me remember the meal non-fondly. The service is quick, very friendly, and professional. The ambiance is cool and slightly moody, I really like it. Overall I think everyone should come here at least once, and I'll keep coming back every once in a while hoping I feel that amazement again that I did on my first visit.",
      "Boia De is a restaurant that let's the quality & taste of the food bring the crowd. The atmosphere was relaxing and the environment humble. The wait staff were professional and very nice. The server gave us recommendations from the menu. They recommend you order around 4-6 dishes if you come as a pair. The chefs are allergy friendly and will assist you with alternatives/make adjustments to the dish. Our experience dining on a Monday night was great, half of the time the restaurant was empty. The music was niche with a mix of classic rock, ABBA, and alternative hits. It's not often you can enjoy some delicious mussels with \"Ballroom Blitz\" playing in the background. This only added to the ambiance.We started with the Marinated Mussels, Crispy Polenta & Veal Sweetbreads. My favorite of these were the sweetbreads, it was my first time trying thyroid and I was blown away by how tender the meat was. The carrot sauce they paired with it was perfection! My boyfriend's favorite were the mussels, they sauce gave an amazing smoky flavor and the potato chips added a great crunch! The crispy polenta was crunchy & the marinade on the eggplant on top added a pop of flavor to the dish! We ordered two pastas & I honestly couldn't pick a favorite, they were both so different but equally delicious! The Saffron Tagliatelle alla Vongole was like something I've never had, the sauce was thicker than most I've had before it reminded me more of a soup. You could taste how fresh the pasta & clams were, this dish was exploding with flavor. I knew ordering the Pappardelle alla Lepre I was going to try rabbit for the first time & I have to say I'm a huge fan! The meat was so tender & tasted similar to dark meat chicken. The thick pasta was great with this dish and like every dish that Boia De serves it had so many incredible flavors. Last main dish we ordered were the lamb ribs, the meat slide right off the bone. The sauce both on the lamb & on the plate were *chefs kiss* and I am obsessed with the sweet & spicy pickles served on top! The crispy tiramisu was easily the best I've ever had. The mascarpone was thick & creamy topped with sea salt, which was such a great compliment to the sweetness. The ladyfingers were crunchy which is an element I've never had in a tiramisu. This to me is what elevated the dish. We also ordered a scoop of vanilla & a scoop of chocolate fudge ice cream. Every single dish we ordered, we would 100% order again. We continued to be blown away with every dish we tried! This is by far one of the best meals I've had in Miami, I think everyone should give it a try. We are already planning our next visit back for more!",
      "Wow! What an incredible experience! From start to finish, this was a treat. Thank you to the entire Boia De team who welcomed and served me like family and royalty. It was like a bougie version of Cheers; the beautiful host Gabriela (aka Gaby) knew my name when I arrived. Gaby and Meg, made wonderful suggestions that were splendid and though I didn't go with all of them, they didn't disappoint. Freddy, my server and bartender, made me a mock tail that was tasty, but too bitter for my tastebuds, so he made a lemonade that was fresh and perfect and paired well with all 7 (yes, 7) of my dishes. I started with the fresh and delicious crudo, following that I enjoyed the chopped salad (the 1/2 portion) which was pretty big enough to share. Following that, I had the baked clams which reminded of tahini (minus the kick) and with a pinch of lemon, it was great! The chicken liver mousse with strawberry glaze was soooo yummy! I almost licked the bowl...literally. My main dish was the duck ravioli. I thought this could've used a cheese feeling to cut the salt, but it was a good dish and much lighter than anticipated. Meg, recommend the gnocchi and OH MY WORD, this was the bees knees and hit the spot! It was my 6th dish and didn't disappoint. I scraped the plate to get everything and when Bruna saw that I was missing a few corners, she brought me a spoon to help me attain my goal. Mission accomplished. Lol! My final dish was the carrot cake. Though the suggested dessert were the chocolate boudin and tiramisu, I went with the carrot cake because I'm not a big sweets fan, and it was perfect for me. From start to finish, the experience was phenomenal. Make a reservation (it helps) and make sure to look out for the illuminated exclamation mark next to the coin laundry and you've arrived. Enjoy!",
      "Not to sound like that person BUT *I've dined at Boia De pre-Michelin* and the food is stellar, always has been. The staff is also great, they remember faces and give off such warm and welcoming energy. I have a love/hate with the changing menu as I'm one who falls in love with dishes and will dream about a meal I had and unfortunately miss miss something no longer available. To be fair, there's always something new to fill that void. In the spirit of not regurgitating all of the well deserved praise I have one complaint. My most recent visit was at 10pm, not my preferred time to dine but beggars can't be choosers. My issue lies with the fact that about 1/3 of the menu was not available. I think it's reasonable to say that a Michelin announcement and a massive waitlist are clear indicators that you're going to be busy. Patrons with late reservations should not be limited in menu choices when you *choose to* offer late reservation times. If there is not enough food, and bookings at a reasonable hour. This is not a buffet style restaurant nor did we walk as they were closing and beg them to seat us--so many unavailable options is disappointing (perhaps even unacceptable). I'll still be back but, this is something that should be looked into.",
      "Excellent restaurant. I think everything has been said about Boia De.The easy going atmosphere and the delicious food that they serve is the key to their success. Extremely well prepared dishes like their squid ink tagliolini which is served cold is incredible... memorable. Lucy's chopped salad, Pappardelle Alla Lepre, Marinated Mussels, etc all delicious... you just can't go wrong. Service is attentive and efficient.",
      "Boia De! Where do I start with this Miami gem? Tucked away in an unassuming strip mall is a charming, quaint Michelin Starred restaurant that does not feel elitist, snobby, or trendy in any way! In fact, I'd argue it's quite the opposite: casual and laid back but completely focused on the quality of the food and dining experience being given to patrons. The vibes are little bit hipster-y and even community-like with the way I saw other diners talking to others at tables across from them! The servers here are both intelligent about the menu and genuinely conversational. We had reservations last week which were booked a month in advance for 9:15 PM in a Friday night, right before the Michelin guide for Florida was revealed. Our dining experience did not disappoint! This was easily one of the top 3 dining experiences I've had anyehere, period.Our server, Freddy M. went over the menu with us and explained all of their greatest hits, as well as some of his own personal favorites. We came here ready to order multiple things and ended up with the following:- CRISPY POLENTA ($9) - with marinated eggplant, and ricotta salat. The perfect snack to share among the table and a healthier alternative to fries sold elsewhere. This is an absolute re-order on a future visit.- BEEF TARTARE ($18) - with tonnato, garlic-shallot crumble, and crispy capers. Instead of corn chips to scoop the beef, this dish comes with a chicharron-like chip/scooper to do the job. A little touch that is unique and goes a long way. The beef itself was also of great quality.- POTATO SKINS ($25) - stracciatella, caviar, and hard egg. This is a show stopper appetizer-- think of a fancier version of TGI Friday's potato skins. An order only brings 2, so I'm not sure if I would order it again personally. But, if this is your first time dining at Boia De, give it a try!- PAPPARDELLE ALLA LEPRE ($24) - with rabbit, rosemary, and tomato. This pasta was cooked al dente and was not overloaded with sauce. This was also our first time eating rabbit meat, which tasted like a more tender version of dark meat chicken.- SWEET CORN AGNOLOTTI ($25) - with porcini. This was the biggest surprise of the night! Who thought that something as simple as half pasta squares stuffed with creamy corn could be so good? We loved both pasta dishes, but this was my fiancée's favorite dish of the evening.- CRISPY TIRAMISU ($9) - exactly how it sounds. Tiramisu crisped up like a meringue cookie. A creative take on a classic Italian dessert!- AFFOGATO ($6) - with a scoop of Frice cream topped with espresso. This was our first time having Affogato and are lovers of this simple dessert now. The espresso satiated our desire for coffee, while the Frice cream scoop provided some creamy sweetness to complement the espresso.To celebrate our recent engagement, our server Freddy M. brought out an additional, stand-alone scoop of Frice cream for us to enjoy. How can I describe Frice Cream? Think of if as a saltier ice cream, made with olive oil. We asked Freddy more about this and learned that this ice cream is locally made and can be purchased at The Citadel. We need a tub, ASAP!What an amazing date night this turned out to be. Thank you to Boia De for making this a memorable evening. Top notch food and great company with an unpretentious atmosphere. What more can you ask for? Congratulations on the Michelin Star-- we're looking forward to future visits and seeing Boia De's continued success. This restaurant is the perfect example a Miami success story that has a soul! Thank you to Freddy M. and all of his colleagues for providing excellent, down-to-earth service. The entire service experience felt homey and friendly!"

      "I was visiting a friend who told me she comes to this restaurant way too frequently - and I understand why! The views from outside and the aesthetic inside are gorgeous. We stopped in for happy hour on a week night and it wasn't too packed. At the bar, we had the bartender surprise us with some mezcal concoctions. All the items on the menu sounded amazing but we ultimately settled on sharing the chilled shrimp and the pan roasted chicken entree. I could not rave about this dish more - it was juicy and flavorful and we absolutely cleared the plate.Other than the food, what made the experience worthwhile was the service! We got to talk with the bartenders and servers who were great. My friend lives right next door and I can't wait to have another excuse to come visit (need to escape the NYC winter!!) to try some more stuff off their menu.",
      "I had a great lunch with a beautiful view. It was very relaxing and enjoyable. There is a $30 corkage fee, up to 3 bottles. Be aware that you cannot bring a bottle that they sell. I wasn't aware of this, but they were gracious enough to work it out with me. The Tuna Carpaccio was my favorite and fabulous! I wanted to lick the sauce off the plate!  I will definitely be back. Sooner than later!",
      "A true tropical Miami dining experience at the freshest and most iconic place celebrating an intimate birthday celebration.To start we had the:BEEF TARTARE AREPAS. There's something about the mixing texture of the caviar, shaved truffles & the arepa. The Goodness!SPICY GRILLED TIGER PRAWNS. This one is for true spicy lovers.  The Fresno chile marinade is no joke and extremely tasty. We were so happily overwhelmed by the Spicy Grilled Tiger Prawns that we had to order a second round. The cheese yuca puffs were a pleasant surprise, and they accompanied the shrimp perfectly. The food was amazing. Ansary's service was memorable. The ambiance was beautiful, and the birthday dessert was a welcome surprise.For drinks; We decided to try The Calm before the Coconut. It's super delicious, very tasty, and smooth but could use an additional shot or better quality rum to make it worth the price.  Warm greetings at the front, great outdoor water views & pure deliciousness. The restaurant was easy to find with valet and street self-parking available. Amara has been on my bucket list since last year and overall I'm glad to have been able to cross this one off my list. Well worth the wait!",
      "We had a party of 8 for a Birthday Celebration. Some of us got there before the rest of the party and gather at the bar. Cusqueña Beers and Amazonia Cocktails to start. Both very good, The bartender very nice.We were seated and Sergei was our waiter.Appetizers: Chorizo, Fish Dip, Yucas, Cauliflower. All tasty and delicious.The Sommelier came and we pick our wine El Enemigo, Bonarda from Mendoza Argentina. Smooth drinking red wine.Then 45 minutes went by and the food was not arriving. My cousin's dinner came: Cauliflower & Green Salad, but not ours. He finished eating and we were still waiting for our food: Mixed Parrillada, 24oz Rib Eye, 12oz  NY Strip, Green Rice(Crispy Rice with Veggies pot)After complaining, they told us the kitchen was having some issues. Finally,  some time later the food arrived. The food was tasty, well seasoned the meats. We enjoyed it.They gave us Coffee & Dessert on the House. The Desserts were Flan, Corn Pancake with Fruits, and a Merengue Bomb that we shared. They were ok.Coffee -Decaf Americano, Espresso, Green Tea.Then came the icing on the cake. The Valet Parking lost the Audi' s car key of my nephew. We have to get an Uber for him to get home, retrieve the second key, and then come back to retrieve the car.",

      "This is definitely one of the restaurant with the best views in the Miami area.The food is good enough to deserve 5 stars.Service was also sensational I highly recommend this establishment",
      "Thank you Franco! Please come back soon.",
      "This place is definitely a beautiful restaurant tucked away in the Edgewater area! Our waiter was very patient and kind towards our big group of 8 but the service was slow. The food wasn't anything to rave about, my steak was a little salty but nothing I had to return. I would give it another try, because of the beautiful scenery and pretty decor!",
      "Hello Ms. Stacy, yes, please come back! Of course, larger tables with orders do take a little longer than typical. Please consider us for date night or brunch for a leisurely experience. Thank you, Amy Upthegrove, GM",
      "Enjoyed some delicious appetizers for our anniversary. The ambiance, food and drinks were amazing!  The smoked fish dip with tostones was full of flavor and very fresh. The ceviche was also very tasty. The short rib empanadas with the sauce were my favorite. Im excited to come back again!",
      "Thank you so much for the great feedback!",
      "Had been told this place is worth going, so I ventured on a Saturday afternoon. A beautiful location in Edgewater, on the waterfront, we didn't have a reservation but we were told to wait at the bar. In the meantime we ordered a drink, I had a Sauvignon Blanc delicious, they opened a new bottle. And my sister ordered a Mocktail which she loved, quite refreshing. We had decided upon the short ribs empanadas, but they were not good, too salty so returned it they took it off the bill. Staff was friendly especially Butler one of the bartenders. Also ordered the cheese puffs, which were delicious and fresh. There were so many other things to try, and they have great happy hour specials. Will try that next time. It Miami pricey but beautiful decor, friendly staff and 2/3 delicious bites make it worth the trip.",
      "Ms. Paola, thank you for coming in! Hope to see you soon again!",
      "Great ambience and great customer service. Celebrated a birthday at Amara. Ordered a parilla to share and pan roasted chicken. The chicken was my favorite. The parilla was just ok. Would like to come back for lunch!",
      "It was good, for the ceviche I expected more, the chorizos were amazing and so were the tomatoes saladEstá bueno, para el ceviche esperaba más, los chorizos estaban increíbles y la ensalada de tomates también",
      "Thank you for the feedback!"

      "We had great time there last Saturday. Our reservation was at 6:45 and we got table right away. The sweet lady our waitress was very attentive. We were ordering: - crispy brie appetizer (3 out 5). Not a fan of this appetizer. - burrata !!! (5 out 5). Loved the sauce and combination of tastes milky burrata and some sweet pieces (i think it was plum). Very delicious! - tiramisu tres leches  !!! (5 out 5). Amazing! Plus it was served in very cute way. - sangrias (5 out 5). Sweet enough and strong enough :)The atmosphere, the music, the service everything was perfect! We had great time with my bf!!! Thank you, we will be back!",
      "Honestly I was disappointed. I was really excited to eat here and the food seemed just average. My husband got the chicken and it was super dry and bland. I got the mussels and they weren't that hot when they got to the table. The restaurant wasn't too busy either and it still took them a while to get our order out. We had about 6 of us at our table. The vibe and the decorations were stunning. I did enjoy the French onion soup which came out warm and was very good. Definitely recommend.",
      "Nice brunch spot, the food is very tasty. The location has lots of beautiful plants and nice shaded outside seating. The staff aren't that friendly but are quick and efficient. One of my problems with this place is there doesn't seem to be a clear walking path. I had several people walking by me and guest as they bumped our seats consistently during our meal.",
      "Great place! Large portions, beautiful atmosphere, and wonderful food. It's out of the way, but a great place to try.",
      "Decided to visit this establishment after the great reviews on YELP. Located in Coconut Grove, this restaurant has a garden theme. We were quickly seated as we had a reservation made prior. The waitress was very friendly and took our drink order. I got the house Sangria which was a little watered down. We put in our order for our entree however the portions seemed pretty small for lunch. I went with the mahi fish sandwich. The sandwich was average and the fish lacked flavor. I was not impressed. My husband ordered the skirt steak and fries but wasn't impressed. Average experience for the price",
      "Very nice restaurant with an outside patio/garden. The food was very good and the staff was friendly and attentive. Will definitely be back soon.",
      "Ever wished you could dine in a literal jungle and eat the best seafood possible? I knew I was going to love this place when I walked through a corridor walled with plants to get to an atrium also filled with plants, perfect atmosphere. The octopus and sun dried tomato appetizer was so good we had to order more for the table. I loved my gorgonzola and pear salad with salmon (a very decently sized portion too!), and my husband thoroughly enjoyed his mahi sandwich. We came here at the suggestion of my friend who had just dined here yesterday but wanted to go again with us once more, and I totally get that. What an amazing place!",
      "Beautiful venue perfect for a romantic dinner. The seating is both indoors and outdoors, but I definitely recommend sitting outdoors in their breathtaking garden. The service is phenomenal as is there food.I had the shrimp ceviche which probably has to be one of the best I've had in the area. It came with plenty of fresh mix seafood (octopus, scallops, shrimp), perfectly balance aji amarillo sauce, and crunchy veggies. Their cocktail menu is also a must to check out. All the cocktails are made with a good selection of spirits and beautifully decorated. Overall great experience!!"

      "An excellent restaurant! We made reservations for my daughter's graduation in her doctorate degree. The service was quick, the food was abundant, and absolutely delicious. It is ver expensive here, though. My filet mignon was $75.  It is also very noisy on a busy evening. It was difficult to talk to each other. Still, the food was absolutely divine.",
      "Come to Dirty French and instantly be transported into the 80s. From the zebra fur-upholstered dining chairs to the Donna Summer playlist, this place is an amazing vibe. They have such a cute cocktail bar room when you first enter, and then the main dining room is in the back. Both the espresso martinis and the dirty martinis are great! The dirty martini was super dirty, with aged olive brine, loved it!The complimentary bread is sooo good. It's almost like a naan bread with a whipped thick butter that reminded me of hummus. We all split with the tuna tartare (possibly the best I've ever had), blue crab croquettes, mushroom millefeuille, lobster ravioli, and oysters.Everything was absolutely amazing. The flavor of the tuna was just so good. The only thing I would consider skipping is the mushroom dish (even though they said this is one if their favorite dishes). The only disappointing part was how small the portions are (although the quality is there).  Probably too expensive for portion size in my opinion.",
      "Really upset with my experience here. This prime rib was honestly really gross and had fat all over it. I wish I took another image of the other piece of it to truly show. I was shocked. Would never come back here to order meat again - not worth the hype.If you come here just order the beignets for dessert. That was honestly the only good thing on the menu.",
      "The night started on the wrong foot when the hostess was not able to accommodate us to a different table even though the whole restaurant was empty.  They sat us in the back corner dungeon.  Our reservation was on a Friday night at 6pm, they let us know they couldn't move us because the restaurant will be filled up in 30 mins. But it was still half empty when we left lol. Besides the cold service, our meal was amazing. Everything was delicious, the ribeye was juicy and savory. The pork was also surprisingly juicy as well. The drinks were also delicious and funky looking. They offered us complimentary beignets, which they ended up charging us at the end for lol. The busboys were much more hospitable then our own server.  They offer valet parking for $20 but besides that there there's no street parking. There is a garage around the corner.",
      "The food seems to get better every time we dine at Dirty French in Brickell! Today is #ThankYouThursday and I chose to highlight this restaurant because it is quickly becoming one of my all time favorite restaurants! The ambiance is beautiful, exciting and the vibe is super fun ! The music is upbeat and energetic without being loud. I love all of the different rooms you can dine in, including the bar area to start with a glass of champagne ! My only call out would be to ask for a table not directly under the air conditioning vent, where it can get a bit cold. The service is impressive. Our waiter was very knowledgeable and helped with trying different dishes. I'm already looking forward to going back for a date night ! You should definitely add Dirty French Steakhouse to your calendar for your next dinner out. You will have a great time!",
      "This is our 3rd trip to Dirty French Restaurant and I can finally say it's in our top fave restaurant's in Miami. It's not your typical steakhouse, so we weren't sure the 1st time Dining here. Each visit it has always been a very fun vibe, though. Gorgeous ambiance, glamorous decor , really fun music and always a great scene ! Once we opened our minds to the bold flavors and spices that accompany the dishes, we were hooked . We've enjoyed the oysters & little neck clams , as well as the tuna tartare for appetizers. I love the uniqueness of their tuna tartare. It's yellowtail tuna , so it's not fatty.It's delicious served with a swipe of an anchovy paste ( but not fishy ) and house made chips, which gives it a ceaser salad flair, if you will. We've tried the lobster ravioli, snapper and filet mignon. I preferred the filet mignon with the au poivre sauce. Unlike most steakhouses that charge anywhere from $3-$7 per sauce , Dirty French offers their 3 sauces to enjoy. My husband prefers the creamed spinach as a side , while I prefer the sautéed spinach with sesame. True to any French restaurant, They have crispy Pom frittes, if you like! Their wine list is very impressive if you're into fine wines, you'll enjoy the wide selection! I love beginning the evening with a glass of champagne  or ending the evening in their beautiful bar for a night cap.",
      "Highlights:* Eccentrically Trendy and Fun* The Extravagant Decor is accompanied by Extravagantly interpreted French     comfort cuisine* Food is well executed with an extensive Franco focused wine list* Figure $200++ per person for a good selection of food and drinks* Reservations are highly recommended or required, online only, no phoneMajor food Group has been on a pre and post pandemic building spree with Carbone, ZZs, Sadelle's and Ha Salon. Dirty French is my favorite of the group. You enter through a dark hallway with a jungle themed bar on the right. The restaurant has three separate dining areas and is unrecognizable from the old Morton's that used to live here. Energetic 1980's music persuades your feet to tap while you review the menu and a dozen or so page wine list.After delicious warm complimentary bread we started with some east coast oysters ($60 per dozen) drizzled with a tasty mignonette. Shellfish lovers that we are, we followed that with a couple of orders ($23 each) of little neck clams served with a mildly spicy red pepper cilantro topping, quite tasty. A not to be missed signature dish is the Mushroom Mille-feuille. Mille-feuille (a thousand sheets) traditionally refers to a pastry made with layers of phyllo dough and cream, aka a Napoleon. The DF version uses paper thin slices of mushrooms to create a savory appetizer ($29). Another signature dish is the Grilled Oysters Bourguignon made with a delicious garlic parsley topping ($25).The Duck a L'Organge ($49) is perfectly executed duck rubbed with Ras El Hanout, which is a North African Spice mixture. In Arabic is means something like \"top shelf\" referring to the Spice Merchants best spices. It consists of 8-12 spices such as cardamon, cumin, clove, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, chili, peppercorns, paprika and more depending on the chef. The shareable Dover Sole  ($135) was as good as anyones. For dessert do not leave without trying the Beignets ($16). They are served hot with outstanding sauces and make a light but great finish for your meal. The sesame spinach side dish ($15) was ok but I would try something else next time. The next section is just for oenophiles:The wine list is predominantly French but has a generous selection of California wines including Marcassin, Peter Michael, Aubert, Merry Edwards, Phelps, Opus, Shafer, etc. There are about 20+ wines offered by the glass starting at $16 for Riesling to $54 for a White Burgundy, $74 for Dom Perignon 2012 and $95 for a taste of Chateau d'Yquem. There is a small selection of Spanish wines. Champanges start around $125 for a Tattinger La Francaise and go up from there. You can get a glass of Gaston Chiquet Tradition for $28.Several of the bottles listed that I ordered were not available, telling me that the list is not updated frequently. You can check it online but I would suggest you have a second, third and fourth choice in mind.Corkage I believe is $95.Markups are all over the place depending on the wine.  Sine Qua Non Aperta 2018 is listed at $395 which is a good price but who knows if they have it. Many other markups are 3 times retail.",
      "Miami entrepreneur Antonio Montana could have walked into here and been perfectly at ease. I'm talking impeccable VIP hosting, wait staff in tuxes and frilly cummerbunds, perfectly gaudy 80s decor and a soundtrack spanning everything from New Wave to synth pop. Alas, they even played an ode to him - Blondie's \"Rush Rush to the Yeyo\".My friend Cecilia came by last night for her final weekend in Miami for a minute, and indeed most of the night Dirty French made us feel like we were going out with a bang. It is a spot for celebrations, for special occasions- a \"Dandy Bear\" for  adults celebrating a special occasion.They have a table-side dessert presentation of their French toast flambeé / Bananas Foster that is as artistic as it tasty with rich brown sugar, fluffy bread and banana liqueurs. Indeed, even the butter pieces are star shaped. Speaking of liquor, they have a broad cocktail and wine selection. I started with their classic Caribbean Mule (Rum, Ginger and Lime) but continued the evening with Disco Dancer (Cognac blended with Vanilla Passion Fruit and a wine chaser) while Cecilia enjoyed prosecco.Her main course was the duck l'orange, which she enjoyed and I didn't try (picky on my part) along with deliciously rich & buttery mashed potatoes (that I did sample). My main - described as lechon in Hialeah - was their delicious cote de porc. Flavored in a blend of brandy and tasso for a sweet base, the tender meat fell off the bone and into my taste buds. My side was their perfectly crispy pommes frites (aka fries). This is a classic side that needs to be on every steakhouse menu.The naan bread amuse bouche with what tasted like hummus at the beginning was a great intro!So why did I start with dessert, and leave only 4 stars? For a steakhouse, a lot of the hors d'oeuvre were seafood based. For someone with allergies, that can be a problem. We tried the mushroom Millefeuille was OK with the creamed corn and spicy red peppers, the mushroom itself could have been a little better, maybe with a little bit of char and not like deli meat. We also would have loved to the try their lounge that was supposed to be open until after the last (11PM) dinner service we enjoyed.All in all, it was a great main course, drinks and dessert and would love to try again!",
      "We came here for girl's night! It was 4 of us! We were seated immediately! Definitely a great vibe! Our waiter came almost immediately to the table. He was enthusiastic, friendly, kind and patient.. he provided suggestions and even had a good sense of humor! The first drink I ordered was not my favorite, but they immediately replaced it.. I ordered the Salmon, which was delicious.. overall it was a great experience. I'd come back again!",
      "Dirty French Steakhouse in Miami has been on my radar for a little while, and a few weekends ago I had the chance to find out what all the talk was about!We started the evening off with a cocktail at the bar - the decor was a very cool combination of animal prints with a loungy relaxed vibe.  I opted for a traditional old fashioned while he chose from their \"classics\" cocktail list.For starters we enjoyed the bread service - flatbread with the fluffiest hummus spread.It was hard to choose what to order as many of the menu items received rave reviews online.  Our server, Tevin, whom I adored, showcased the truffle rocks from which we could add shavings to our meals. Their wine list offers over 700 bottles of wine!  The sommelier assisted us in choosing a fantastic 2000 Margeaux.  The Mushroom Millefeuille was widely recommended.  I liked it - especially the french corn and yellow curry sauce.  Being newly (well me at least) oyster fans, we couldn't pass up the Giant Grilled Oysters Bourguignon.It was a toss up between their world famous prime rib or the Wagyu Tomahawk, ultimately choosing the latter (and grateful we did so!).  The tomahawk was paired with pommes puree that were super creamy and heavenly, stuffed leeks and a trio of sauces (that were not needed - the steak was perfect on its own).For dessert, we opted for the Opera Cake - the perfect ending to a delicious evening!",
      "So we saw this place and decided to give a try and they didn't have any reservations till 10:45pm super late place was crowded so they sat us down they told us we could sit next to each other but we did anyways because everyone else was doing the same .we order the lobster ravioli and the steak with truffle let's start by saying the ravioli were frozen ravioli super hard and nasty  the steak  didn't taste like steak the truffle was fake didn't taste like anything and didn't look like it very disappointed the drinks were okay the fries  were not good and the mushroom  ugh no good .they asked if we wanted to take the food we didn't want to say no so we did and it ended up in the trash outside in valet I don't recommend this place stay away super nasty place ."

      "Went here every day of my quick trip to Miami because it was a rare spot open before 8. The space was clean and quiet with good jams playing. This was perfect for mentally getting ready in the morning. I enjoyed the coffee! But I am not your fancy 212 degree steamed oat milk girl. I like coffee pretty much every way from hot cappuccino to iced latte to cold brew. The drink came out fast and the staff was always so nice transferring to a to-go cup when I inevitably needed to head to work. The breakfast here was also on point. I enjoyed pretty much everything I ate. My only complaint would be the size of the croissant breakfast sandwich but that's probably because it was so good!",
      "You order at the register and then you're given a number and you proceed to find a place to dine. Aside from the Quinoa bowl one of my other favorite menu items is the prosciutto panini. Also try the roasted potatoes! The only thing I don't like is their pastries and cakes. I want to like them so bad but I always find them to be stale. Otherwise Crema Gourmet is a great option for breakfast and or lunch in downtown Miami.",
      "I believe Crema is the one best breakfast spot downtown. It's a quiet little spot on East Flagler that is popular with residents and downtown regulars. The bakery offerings are simple and delicious. Nothing too crazy just what you would expect from a French/Mediterranean Bakery.. You must try the Open Face Breakfast Sandwich. Eggs Benedict and Nova Plates are just a few of the finds. You can even get a simple bacon and eggs breakfast cooked the way you like it. Service is good and efficient and the staff is very courteous. And did I mention that BREAKFAST is available all day. It's a nice change of pace for those of us who don't like to be told when I can have an omelette and some bacon. I think Crema will become the place to be once Flagler Street reopens.",

      "So good! I stayed in Miami for 2 months and this was my spot every Sunday morning. I can't remember what the first thing I ordered was, but on my second visit I tried the chocolate chip pancakes and OMG they are delicious! From there forth I just ordered those pancakes. It's a very large portion so it's a pretty good deal for the price considering the average costs in Miami. Lots of chocolate chips and lots of banana slices. I will definitely come back here on future visits.",
      "Love the coffee! The atmosphere is beautiful, great place to work remotely if you don't mind the noise.",

I ordered the croissant breakfast sandwich and my boyfriend ordered the breakfast sandwich. We both ordered a latte with 2 shots. Both were delicious and the staff is friendly.

      "I would describe their food as ok to eat in a pinch.  There are much better options for breakfast food within a couple of blocks.However, what inspired me to write this review was a recent visit.  I needed a baguette to make a sandwich.  I don't like some of the nearest options and I didn't want to walk the extra two blocks to Whole Foods to get Zak the Baker (big mistake).Anyways, I order a baguette to go, pay $5.35, so good to go.  Nope!  They hand me half a baguette.  When I point this out, the guy at the counter whips out a ruler and measures it, tells me \"this is ten inches.\"  But he sold me a baguette, right?  Nope again, he sold me 10\" of a baguette for $5.35.  LOL, never again."

      "Came to Salt/Wetlab for happy hour. The Location was easy enough to find, after you know what youre looking for. All my \"in the know\" friends had been to Wetlab for Happy Hour and live music at sunset and I decided it was time to go exploring. We drove past the Miami Sequarium parking and entered the UM Marine Campus gate. We asked the security guard where the best place to park was. He directed us around the buildings to the right, which lead us in a U back  towards the water. There was plenty of parking right in front around 430pm. If you park in the garage, thats fine too. There's a walk through to the bar. We were one of the first to arrive and ordered a bucket of beer. $20 for 5 craft beer cans and the selection was wide. You can put down a deposit for $3 to get pint glasses with the Salt logo. If you decide to take it home, its a great souvenir. If you return it, you'll get your $3 deposit back. Lots of people apparently forget, because we walked away with a couple. They were giving out free apps and they were so-so. the Brisket egg rolls were the best, but those were paid for. You'd have to try a few different things to figure out what is good from Salt.  The band set up and played right on the patio in front of us. The sun was setting, the crowd was civilized and we had a great time. There were about 10 of us in our group and the vibe was friendly and welcoming. It was a great night! The only issue i had was that I had brought my pup, and that night they had passed around notice that dogs would no longer be allowed. I enjoy dog friendly places, but my pup is well behaved and tiny, so there must've been a dog that ruined things for the rest of them. Sad but ill probably not go back unless dogs are allowed again. For a one time visit, it was great!",
      "Love this hidden gem. The key west feel is the perfect medicine to unwind on Fridays. Live band is always on point. Food and drinks are good and incredibly affordable. But the view of the pier and sunset from the 2nd story balcony is the absolute cherry on top.",
      "Fully enjoyed this bar with both indoor and outdoor seating. Being on the Univ Miami campus, we got to enjoy the passionate and enthusiastic conversation from conversationists like ourselves over several $20-$25 pitchers of beer. They have a nice selection of local Floridian/Miamite beers. Thoroughly enjoyed myself.",
      "Great quick lunch. Very fast to get food. It's not the most amazing food but it's way better than mc Donald's. Menu is always fresh with new options.",
      "As some other reviews have stated and I wish I had read before eating here, you're eating in a university cafeteria, and the food was exactly what you might expect from a university cafeteria. We saw that the restaurant had great ratings so we decided to try it, not realizing the aforementioned tidbit...and discovered later that many of the high ratings are for private events held here instead of actual 'restaurant' patrons. I had the fish and chips, the batter was good on the fish but the fish was either old or just very over cooked and dry. Fries were fine. My friends' had a similar experience with their food, it tasted either over cooked or just not fresh. We did go an hour before close, so maybe the food would've been better cooked/fresher earlier, but it definitely wasn't going to be 4 or 5 stars either way. The most important thing here is just to be aware that you're eating cafeteria food in a school cafeteria. The only real positive is a nice view overlooking the bay and lower prices.",
      "View is great! That's it! Food was not well prepared. Menu is very limited because of pandemic and it's cafeteria style and served in styrofoam. No beer or wine served",
      "QualityTop notch! From top to bottom, from start the finish, I cannot say enough about SALT. Down in the Key Biscayne area just beyond the Miami Seaquarium, inside the University of Miami marine science center of that area, is this amazing open to the world wonderland. The quality overall is superb. Yes, I have to disclose that I was at SALT for a private event (a baby shower), yet still, the quality was unreal. From the bright setting to the view, to the food and drink, all the way to the great service, I really did enjoy all aspects of SALT.QuantityTo discuss the 'quantity' I suppose I would have to talk about the size of the venue and how not only can SALT comfortably hold massive amounts of lunch goers, but it is so well set up for private catering functions, such as the baby shower party I was at on the day.ValueThe value of the SALT venue is excellent. From the friendly staff to the food service and the prices of drinks, all what any student or party-goer could expect is here in a great value. I intend to look into this spot for my family the next time we need a great spot in the Key Biscayne area, which should be coming up in the months to come. SALT provides a great value overall for sure.AmbianceThe mood and feel to SALT of course has the perfect Miami, let your hair down, wear your sandals, and enjoy the saltwater air smell. Whether you like to sit outside on a bar stool or inside with the massive open space and clear view windows, the clean, pristine feel and white touch will set the perfect mood, whether for an afternoon lunch or a party with 50-100 close friends.CrowdThe crowd is super friendly. Again, full disclosure that I did also attend a baby shower at SALT, being open to folks in the area and enjoying with the UM students does provide a great crowd experience and time. I also would add that the crowd can be split even for those who prefer the louder outdoor style with high tables and stools to then those who prefer being inside with good old air conditioning.ServiceEach time I either needed a refill or something different to eat, when it came down to buffet style food enjoyment, the staff was so friendly and accommodating. At the bar area, the young lady whom struggled just a tad bit with opening a wine bottle, kept her cool, was so nice through all, which resonated throughout all the wait staff and security around the facility.ParkingSeeing as how SALT in located inside a marine science school that is part of UM, parking is a little tricky, however a breeze when you had great directions, as we did and which took us so close to the front door of SALT. Wow, I did not expect an easy surface lot, even the garage would have been fine, but we did better than I expected and all was well. A great touch to add to my picky ways.ExtraSALT provides the flare, allure and overall clean feel that is perfect for either an afternoon lunch or a catered event. SALT would be nice for a couple's afternoon, a beer with a buddy, or just a quick bite on the run. All in all, with everything SALT offers, at such reasonable prices, I would give the spot a solid two thumbs up and a go to for sure. SYOY!",
      "Came to Salt for a private event, so my review might be a bit skewed. Location: University of Miami RSMAS campus, hidden, not easily found (I asked someone from Campus Safety for directions)Ambience: awesome! Especially for the event I was attending, most of the guests had never been to UM/ Miami in general. Great views of the water... golden hour/sunset was incredible! Food/Drinks: incredible beer selection! The bartender was awesome and met me sample some before making my commitment. The food was beyond flavorful and I was extremely impressed. Salmon melted in your mouth, steak was cooked to perfection, arugula salad had the perfect amount of dressing... I was in heaven!Staff: very friendly and knowledgeable!",
      "Amazing sunset!  Wide selection of worldly craft beer. Great service!  I didn't try any food, but what I saw looked good.",
      "We were thinking to visit after Crandon Park kitesurfing session on Friday and it was the only close Waterfront place and  working till 3pm??Seriously? Is that Nebraska? If you don't want to work leave the spot for someone who's willing!Closed on weekends - no comment.Fri 9:00 am - 3:00 pm Sat Closed Sun Closed"

      "What an amazing spot, we absolutely LOVED it. It's fairly young and trendy, so I would not take my baby boomer parents here (or a baby in general)- but for a younger, fun, lively crowd, this is perfect. The inside is really cool - lots of artwork, somewhat hidden restaurant, similar to a speakeasy. The drinks were unique and incredible and the food was OUTSTANDING! Very gastronomic - if you're into that sort of thing (my parents wouldn't get it). We basically ordered the entire menu, until we nearly exploded. Here were a few memorable plates (as in, those I can remember after imbibing for a few hours)...Spanglish milk bread - the black salt on top. WOW. They say, once you go black (salt), you never go back right? Exactly. The guava butter was unlike any butter I have ever had. It's very tropical, and fruity! Wagyu beef ravioli - that blue cheese sauce was to die for - take some of that milk bread and drunk your bread in this sauce to your heart's desire (and worry about the consequences later, because bread and cheese, whew!) Nitro Watermelon Tataki - the only remotely healthy thing that entered our mouths at dinner. It's such a cool fish - watermelon, pomegranate seeds, toasted pumpkin seeds, olive oil and a total flavor overload. Not to mention the fact that the fish came out looking like sashimi grade tuna. So cool. Arroz Mamposteado - this was a cool fish. It was rice and beans, but mixed with avocado creme and and pork belly and chips. Incredible. I'm not much of a dessert but holy smokes did we devour the suspiro. I'm quite positive I licked the jar towards the end of the evening - don't judge me. I wish I could remember what cocktail I had, but the choices are all so unique and fun, I should have tried them all. Eh, gives me a reason to go back, right?!",
      "Thank you so much for the kind words and the detailed review of all of our dishes, Shannon.  It was a pleasure hosting you, and we look forward to your next visit!",
      "Obsessed is an understatement.Found this place on Yelp (I love you Yelp!) and with the rating and images I knew I was SOLD. The show stopping, craft cocktails is what I came for and I wasn't sure what to expect once we came. Was it a hype? Would I be disappointed? Who cares! You're in Miami and going to a Spanglish cocktail bar. We didn't make reservations but we did read it wasn't too hard to get in. And it was exactly just that. Came here at around 9:30 pm on a Saturday night and we were seated to the side entrance table with couches right away. It wasn't a good option for dining but we literally only came here for the cocktails so it was perfect!The vibe check in this place was everything. There was a live dj tucked in to the side making sure the music was on point. And it was!On to the craft cocktails:I ordered the Pornstar Mejican@ and it was delicious wish the mezcal was more of the star of the show and to be honest, given that everyone else's cocktails were truthfully visually so pleasing wish the presentation for this one was as well but that's totally ok!!! I still loved my experience. My hubby ordered the Cafetera Old Fashioned and WOW. What a presentation and fun way to serve it with an actual cafetera. It was definitely a show stopper. The Caipirinha Frizá was delicious and very unique as well and the Paparazzi came served in a photo lens so that was pretty cool!We loved Spanglish, would be back in a heart beat. Overall great vibes for cocktails and pretty cool presentation that really makes this place stand out. Excited to try their food next time!",
      "This place gives my New York Vibes OD! It's definitely giving New York Speakeasy Vibes. You'll probably miss it if your not paying attention because the sign outside is only a neon bottle sign. Inside is intimate with the cutest decor, low key, playing all the classic jams. I love a place that sets a vibe with an good playlist! Okayyy! We came for drinks after dinner, so we didn't order food but they did have a menu. All the drinks we ordered were sooo freakin good, and were in creative instagram worthy cups. This is definitely going to be my new hideaway spot. Service was amazing! Will be coming back!",
      "Okay, here's the thing with this place, it's so freaking loud that you can barely hear the person next to you, it's impossible to have any sort of conversation with a large group of people. The food was okay and drinks were pretty good on the other hand, so I think this is a good place for dates, just not a large gathering.",
      "Hi Anton, thank you so much for taking the time to share your experience at Spanglish.  We apologize for the music being too loud, and this is something we’re going to adjust.  Although, we’re happy to hear you enjoyed the drinks!We hope to see you again soon!",
      "What an awesome chic place.  Amazing craft cocktail & gastro pub style tapas.

      "The entrance to Spanglish is so subtle that it's easy to miss! Once you enter, the ambiance is cozy, intimate, and welcoming. We came because of the happy hour -- their cocktails were $9 and some small dishes were marked down! We ordered a round of the caipirinhas first and sadly were a bit disappointed, it was way more tart than expected and just tasted like lemon juice. The Chilcano tasted similar with the overpowering citrus. The Spanglish mule was way better! For small plates, we ordered the octopus croquettes, Caribbean dumplings, and a side of yuca. The octopus croquettes were my favorite of the items we ordered -- crispy, served hot, and the octopus inside was tender. The Caribbean dumplings were a little mushy, and the yuca was a bit tough and the sauce it was served with tasted like Big Mac sauce which I am not a fan of. Everything came out pretty fast, though!",
      "Finally got to visit Spanglish and let's just say I fell in love! I came here for happy hour with a friend and honestly we were blown away by how delicious everything was. We ordered the Spanish Milk Bread, Timba Frita, Queso E' Craba , and Tuna Tostadas. My favorite dish we tried was the Timbra Frita. It was the perfect bite full of flavor. We also ordered cocktails. We both ordered the Paparazzi which honestly tasted amazing but the presentation was killer. It comes served in a camera lens. Overall this place is a vibe. The music was lit. They were playing bad bunny. The artwork is awesome. I definitely see myself coming back here.",
      "Location a bit hidden in plain sight, so be sure to stop and read signs. Small  and intimate setting with a great ambiance for drinks and light bites with friends. The food was ok nothing over the top or extraordinary. I did like my margarita with the seafood bites. Drinks here before a walk around in Wynwood is never a bad idea.",
      "This place has no sign in front. We drive up and down and finally found it. Outside looks like it was closed. Nothing indicating it was opened except for a sign out front that shows menu of the day. We walked it and surprisingly was like wow. This is a cute small cozy restaurant.  The booth I say were pretty close to one another.  The bar area has 6 stools. The food was excellent! Extremely flavorful and so good. The octopus appetizer was amazing. We ordered one of their popular dish and weren't disappointed.  I forgot to photo that dish because I was so hungry.  Everything we had was great including the drinks. We love craft drinks and for sure it was super crafty. The paparazzi drink was so cute. It came in a camera cup and tasted great.I would be definitely coming back here again soon and recommend everyone to try if you haven't been here.",
      "Came here to try a few drinks on a Friday night and it wasn't as busy as I expected. I was able to sit at the bar and watch the bartender make these really cool looking and tasty drinks! The paparazzi was my favorite. Something about the dill and passion fruit combination was something I didn't know I needed. The vuela paloma was just okay, I'm just not the biggest fan of grapefruit. And the cafetera old fashioned tasted like a REALLY strong Cuban coffee, which I really enjoyed. Although the drinks were great, the vibe was kinda ruined by these drunk idiots sitting next to us at the bar, yelling and screaming. But I would still come here again to enjoy a cool curated cocktail."

      "Overall: Amazing food. We will definitely be back! The Great: - Biscetta allá Fiorantina. We got the serving for 2. Incredible. - Tiramisu OMG - get it. - Tableside Caesar - Very nice server - Ben - Foccacia bread The good: - Meatball App - The wine cellar and steak presentation as you walk in is a nice touch General feedback: - Dimming the lights a bit more would give it some real ambiance and a homier feel  - They JUST opened so cut the staff some slack. I've been on a team opening a restaurant before and it's so hard. They did great! - Good location - easy access with ample parking. A local steakhouse is just what the neighborhood needs - The staff was really sweet and everyone was really working hard all night.",
      "Went here for a birthday dinner. They have a great menu with all sorts of selections.  Our waiter was pushy and rude.  We ordered a NY Strip, Branzino, Pasta Bolonaize, Filet Minan, truffle fries and salad.  The steaks were ordered medium well done.  All the food was good except the steaks.  They kept bringing back the steaks rare and the waiter was angry with nasty comments toward us.  If you go here avoid this guy.  We told the mgr who seemed surprised.",
      "The staff and Marco was amazing! The food, absolutely Devine, the portion the flavor, the attention to detail were all perfection. Thank you for making my husband's 40th bday so memorable.",
      "Hello my name is Nick. Of course I'm from New York. I usually don't write reviews specially bad ones we got to this nice restaurant very gorgeous inside. The bread was delicious. I have to say the first course was a pasta dish we split. It had a Bolognese sauce on it it was served hot and good. Little did I know that was the highlight of a dinner. My steak came out first they cut it up which I wasn't crazy about but it was cold. my friends ordered a veal dish a special order. They accommodated them but the dish also was ice cold. The dish presentation was very nice but it being cold was definitely a problem. I must mention the sides to twice cook baked potato was a baked potato not twice cooked. The cream spinach was nice fresh baby spinach sautéed with melted cheese on top. The menu, said cream of spinach. I do wish they would get their act together, and I would even consider trying it again. The Decour is very elegant. It was Christmas Eve. We got there at 6:15 and it wasn't that busy. There was no excuse for the cold food. I must say I was very disappointed. My name is nick hogan.",
      "Nice bar.  Quality food.   Good service    Except bartender Angie.  Good wine and liquor selection",
      "Great new restaurant. Not crowded yet. We got frutti dimare and branzino, both dishes were excellent. I especially liked that unlike many other places they go easy on a salt. Highly recommend!",
      "Rippoff stupid place out of place Does not belong among working class neighborhood Just close down and go to Ball Harbor",
      "Ridiculous prices for a basic Italian restaurant It will never make it in NMB Will not bring lunch customers at this prices Dinner customers will go to a well known reliable restaurant",
      "My boyfriend and I had been waiting for what felt like an eternity for this place to open because we love Frank so we had to check out a place named after his iconic song. Just like his song, our experience was great! The place feels intimate and has a great ambiance for a date night. The food was also incredible! Yet, the best part was the service. Our server Andrea was so sweet and helpful the entire night. I highly recommend!",
      "One of the most authentic Italian restaurants I've ever eaten at!  First rate and class-  Look forward to having many more meals at My Way!  Thanks to the incredible staff for an incredible evening.",
      "Perfect place for date night! The food was amazing and the staff very friendly and attentive. Can not go wrong with the BURRATA CAPRESE for starter and my favorite the FILETTO DI MANZO! So many tasty options can't wait to go back next time I am in town!"

      "Seaspice was amazing. It's a fantastic restaurant with a great view right on the Miami River. If you don't right you can catch the live music as the sun sets, and the restaurant transforms to a lounge. Totally worth coming Parking is tricky, and if you're not paying attention you might miss it as you drive by. But it's a gem worth coming back to.",
      "Seaspice is known to Miami locals as a very high end resturant, frequented by celebrities.  I have no idea why.  The service is pretty awful.  The drink runners are horrible.  It takes about 30 minutes for just a drink to be brought out to you.  The food is mediocre.  It is definitely NOT worth the price, which is very expensive.  I am giving two stars because the view is amazing.  Seaspice is right on the water and has a gorgeous ambiance.  You can watch yachts drive by and some will even pull up and park.  The other star is for the tres leches.  This dessert was AMAZING, I would go back just to eat it again.  But otherwise, Seaspice is nothing special.  Save your money.",
      "A place that tries to be high end but fails to deliver.Service ? Mediocre Food ? Below parFirst thing when you check in is they tell you that you have a 2 hr max(tacky)",
      "I read this was one of the best patio dining AND a hot spot for celebrities in Miami, so I had to go check it out on our recent travels to this area...Initially I was worried about our luggage situation, as we had to carry our luggage to the restaurant since this was our last stop in Miami. However, they were very accommodating, and let us store some of our stuff in the closet, and we kept the big luggage with us, near our table.As expected, the patio scene was spectacular...city skyline and seaside views, with plenty of yachts passing by! The place indeed had that chic celebrity vibe...truly FAB! Loved the music overhead as well. Somehow, I expected some snobbiness...but not at all. Service was great!Then the food. OMFG...I've had some amazing foods lately, but this takes the cake. Even the complimentary bread was amazing (and unique)! My husband ordered this Wagyu Burger, and I chose this Ragu Pappardelle ( THE best Ragu Pappardelle I've ever had...EVER. ). Then this Pavola dessert...again, just beyond delish. Truly, this was foods for the celebrities.Honestly, I'm shocked at how low the rating is for this place. I assume that if the service isn't top notch, it would probably piss some folks off. The pricing was on the outlandish side...with even lunch entrees starting at around 40. There was even an appetizer item priced at around 70 bucks! Luckily, like I said, I felt that the foods and the service (and especially the spectacular ambiance) made up for it. There was this big yacht parked right near us, which somewhat blocked some of the views from the left. Still, we got our eyeful of seaside/yachtside views.In any case, this was a great way to end our trip in Miami.",
      "Went here with a group of girlfriends for brunch and everything was delicious, they were super accommodating as well.I had the froze , a cucumber and gin cocktail and 2 grey goose and sodas and all were fantastic.As a table we split the fresh fish and a couple sides and it was delicious. Also love the free bread It is definitely on the pricier side overall tbh but great for a fun \"fancy\" brunch",
      "Came here for Miami spice and although we spent more than we thought we would, we had a good time. Everything was delicious. The kale Caesar had pecans and Granny Smith apple slices, never had a Caesar like this but it was a nice change! The Shrimp Pesto Whole Wheat Spaghetti was my favorite, even though I'm not the biggest fan of pesto. The burger was good too just a little messy from the truffle aioli. The chocolate cremoso and tres leches was very good but I'd go with the cremoso for the cocoa nib crumble, yum! All in all, I think it's overpriced and I probably won't come here again because of that. The cheapest bottle of Chardonnay was $75 and most drinks were $20. I only came here for Miami spice and still spent almost $200.",
      "Given we still have Miami Spice going on until the end of the month we decided to try out the lunch menu @ Seaspice gorgeous location on the Miami River, sitting outdoor is really relaxing, so beautiful to watch the boats go by, really lovely To start we had the Comte' Cheese Soufflé, I have to admit this was a bit disappointing, it really did not have the texture of a real soufflé  but then............ the Shrimp Pesto Whole Wheat Spaghetti and the Pan-Seared Chilean Seabass were really good as dessert, both the Tres Leches and the Chocolate Cremoso were yummy Try it out before Miami Spice ends, you can check out the Miami Spice Menus on miamiandthebeaches.com@seaspicemia",
      "First time for me at Seaspice, it is located on the banks of the Miami River it is a gem that you should not miss. Sit outside in the courtyard enjoy your food and a drinks while watching the boats go by, just beautiful We had the Miami Spice lunch which has a very affordable fix price 3 course menu for $ 28, unfortunately this will end soon, nevertheless, I would defiantly go back again for sureRegarding the Miami Spice menu only one observation, they should have had more than one choice for the Entrees without the extra charge, right now you have 4 choices and 3 of these have extra charge on it, not really fair given that you are promoting the Spice menu, you should have at least two or three choices included in the price and one or two with the extra charge We had had Prince Edward Island Mussels, Grilled, the Grilled Faroe Island Salmon and the Profiteroles and Peaches and Cream. My favorite where the Mussels, the garlic pizza bread they brought for the table was absolutely delicious, the Salmon was good too. I had the Peaches for dessert and it was ok, not really my thing, my friend said the Profiteroles were great, next time I will not opt for the healthy dessert We enjoyed all with a good Albariño wine, our experience was made especially enjoyable by our waiter Fabrizio, he was really great ! Thank you Fabrizio @seaspicemia",
      "Bad first impression. Its not a nice feeling to feel like you have to beg to spend your money at a restaurant. Every year I look forward to Miami Spice. It's a great way to try out various restaurants and a unique spread of menu options. Seaspice was on my radar and happened to be one of the participating restaurants offering the Miami Spice menu. I contacted the restaurant in advance and made a reservation for 3:30p for a party of four. My mom who is from out of town was excited to join us for lunch. I advised the restaurant we were doing the Miami Spice menu. The restaurant made it clear that they charge $50pp for No Shows. At 3:15pm, we arrived for our reservation. The hostess Karin greeted us, and advised us that they were running behind on the reservations and because of this they will not be able to offer the Miami Spice menu. Only the a la-carte menu will be offered. This was a bit upsetting because we drove almost an hour to get there and the restaurant is refusing to offer the Miami Spice promotion. Our natural instinct was to just say forget it we will go somewhere else. I mean, at the end of the day who wants to beg to spend their money? It's absurd. If the restaurant is offering a promotional menu and because to no fault of our own they are running behind why should we be penalized?My Mom looked so bummed out. Because she was so excited to try this place. I decided to walk back in and ask for a Manager. The Manager took 20min to come out. When he finally did come over, he introduced himself as Collin. I explained to him what was going on and it seemed as though he wasn't aware that the hostesses were turning Miami Spice customers away. He decided to make it right and advised Karin to honor the Miami Spice menu. Impressive! Things were turning around. Besides the encounter at the hostess stand, the restaurant is beautiful. It is situated on Miami's waterfront were you can view the million dollar yachts passing by. They also have docks for those interested in docking and dining. You can view the downtown city skyline which I am sure looks amazing at night.The food was excellent. The Miami Spice menu offered a three course lunch for $28. You have the choice of a starter (Kale Salad, Cheese Souffle, or White Gazpacho). A choice of entrees (Seabass, Chicken Breast, Shrimp Pesto Pasta, Wagyu Burger, or Plant Bowl). And a choice of dessert (Tres Leches or Chocolate Cremoso). They also offer the option to add a Glass of wine for and additional $12. I ordered the Comte Cheese Souffle, the Green Circle Farms Chicken Breast, and the Tres Leches. The others in my party ordered the Kale Salad, Gazpacho, and Seabass. For starters, My favorites were the Kale Caesar Salad and Cheese Souffle. The Kale Caesar had a mix of shredded Granny Smith apples, pecans and a creamy Caesar dressing. The cheese Souffle was like a fluffy egg Souffle with a cream parmesan sauce and tomato chutney. Delicious!For entrees, both the Seabass and Chicken breast were amazing. The Chicken breast was tender and juicy, served on top of a creamy polenta and topped with corn, peas, and mushrooms. The seabass was seared nicely to give a nice crunch on the outside, while perfectly flaky and moist on the inside. It was served with stewed garbanzo, Swiss chard, and smoked potato. For desserts, we all had Tres Leches. It was served in a small Mason jar topped with 3 milks, and berries. Perfect way to end the meal. The portions are not large but it is filling. The flavors are fresh and very well balanced. The food presentation was notable. The Watermelon Tequila drink was delightful and refreshing. The froze was also a big hit. The cocktails were presented well and created perfectly. We enjoyed everything. Our waiter, Austin was very friendly. He made great recommendations and was very attentive.An 18% gratuity was added to the tab. There are lots of street parking accessible. In the end, the food was great. Ambience was amazing. The hostesses can use additional customer service training and learn to use better judgment to improve the customers experience. There was no need to escalate the matters to a manager. It could have been handled properly by showing empathy, apologizing, and finding a solution to the problem.",
      "Hi Kim,Thank you for dining with us and leaving a detailed review. It has been forwarded to our management team. Our apologies for the confusion at the door.  Glad to hear Collin accommodated you and your experience was turned around.  We are happy to see your great feedback regarding the food, cocktails, and Austin’s Service.  Hopefully you will join us again in the near future!",
      "This is my second time going to sea spice & I normally love it as the first time. I never leave bad reviews But this second time MY PHONE WAS STOLEN AND SECURITIES DID NOThing about it. Instead we're trying to blame me for the situation. I'm not drunk nor was drunk. I walked in with 2 phone and walked out with 1.We came as my friend USUALLY does and this is how they treated us  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME. I thought it was 5 star so nothing could go wrong. With a security right next to our table my phone STILLL got stolen. It was on the table. And to whoever has the time to steal phones is just sad imagine what else they can steal... I wil ask to review cameras but with the way I was treated when I let them know I lost my phone I doubt they will be helpful but I'll let every platform form of review know that they steal phones here. I know the exact time frame as well so they wouldn't even have to look much at the cameras. Let's see. BTW I BEEN HOME SICK AFTER EATING THESE OYSTERS I COULDNT Even celebrate my baby's birthday w him.",
      "Came here for my birthday dinner with my boyfriend for a 7:15 reservation (we called in advance for an outdoor seat dock side) we waited about ten minutes after our arrival for our table to be ready at the bar, the short wait was definitely worth it. Started with an aperol spritz at the bar then ordered octopus and gazpacho to start. Octopus portion was good but the olive oil tasted burnt since it came out on a sizzling hot cast iron looking skillet (its very easy to overcook octopus, please just bring a regular plate next time.) I also had the whole main lobster. Extremely delicious large portion of perfectly cooked and seasoned lobster, bravo. My boyfriend had the truffle coated Chilean sea bass and he absolutely loved it. Vibe: 5/5 this place definitely is a scene but not overwhelmingly pretentious or obnoxious. Absolutely loved the music as well. Service:3/5 A bit slow, our server was very attentive when we were able to get his attention but we had to always wave him down. Food: 4/5 everything was honestly pretty good (octopus could've had a bit more attention to detail)",
      "Hi Liz,Thank you for celebrating your birthday with us!  We are so happy to hear you had a great experience and enjoyed the food.  Your feedback regarding the octopus has been sent to our chef. We look forward to seeing you again soon!"

      "good little restaurant in Miami Airport. we got stranded overnight (thanks southwest) and got dinner from here. food was good, did not disappoint. i got the alfredo and would get it again if i ever came back.",
      "Hiram was amazing, took care of us lie he knows me and my family for many years!!We ordered the shrimp tacos and the kale salad plus nachos and the quesadilla all AA .Will definitely return.",
      "Priority club got us $30 worth of food & drink here.  We ordered cold drinks, quesadillas & guac.  A nice stop while we wait to board our flight.  Freddy our waiter was efficient and friendly. I ordered a frozen pomegranate Mojito without salt.  My husband ordered a mango mojito.  His drink was perfect mine wasn't frozen and came with salt.  Our chips came with guac and salsa The quesadilla was beautiful & flavorful.  The barbecued pork gave it a really nice barbecue flavor, but it wasn't truly Mexican. They have a captive audience in the airport.",
      "Highlights/Lowlights1. Priority Pass Accepted 2. Haven't Ever Had to Wait3. Friendly ServiceI've eaten at Corona Beach House a few times during flight connections in the Miami airport. I feel like since COVID, many airport restaurant restaurants closed or have limited hours leading to long wait times if you want to sit down. I've walked right up to the bar and gotten a seat every time I've eaten at Corona Beach House (great when you have limited time!).The one thing I've noticed both times is there is kind of a watery/mildewy scent to the restaurant. It's a little unpleasant but nothing totally off putting. Service is always fast and friendly! This last time I was there I ordered two glasses of wine and the quinoa salad with grilled chicken. The salad was surprisingly good and portioned fairly.  The server was on top of keeping my wine glass full which I definitely appreciated. These are airport prices so of course everything is at a premium but I think my total was about $35 and over $24 was covered by my Priority Pass perk which was nice. I will certainly be back as this restaurant is conveniently located and accepts Priority Pass!",
      "Ok.. we were stuck in the airport, flight was delayed and the Corona Beach House was next to the gate.When in Miami you're a captive audience.  We had 2 hours before boarding so this was a good choice.At first glance of the menu, its reasonable.  $15-$18 for food... not bad for the airport.  Wine was $10-$13 a glass.  Since it was mid afternoon, my husband and I opted for  2  draft beers.   Flight was delayed  another hour so we had 2 more.  Total bill...$63.  Guess that's why they don't post the price on the menu!!No choice if you're stuck in the terminal... but at least you know now!!!",
      "We had an early morning layover in Miami so we decided to have breakfast at Corona Beach House. Even though it was 8:30 am, it was basically like Sunday brunch. They have a small breakfast menu and they do serve alcohol.I had scrambled eggs and cheese with toast and potatoes. My friend had a breakfast quesadilla. The food was good, but very basic. We did not have any alcohol.  They had a random 90s playlist. We got to enjoy the sounds of Marky Mark, Mandy Moore, Destiny's Child, and BSB. Our server was really nice and attentive in the beginning, but at some point he disappeared. We had to ask another server to go find him and it still took a few minutes before he finally came back to the table to take care of the bill.",
      "Stopped in because we had some time to kill before our flight. Enjoyed a tasty pina colada and some nachos and wings. The place was packed as it was dinner time, and it took longer than we expected to get our food and our bill. Be cautious if your flight is boarding soon and it is rush hour.",
      "Came in for the Priority Lounge Access and when you check in on Yelp you get a free Coronita! We got two Bloody Mary's and split the Breakfast sandwich which was good but not very hot. The place was pretty busy.  Only about 6 seats at the bar with several high tops. Good place to stop in before your flight.",
      "As someone who's traveling all the time. This restaurant in Miami airport is the only that has fresh and good food! They have a huge menu with many options. The best thing is the shrimp tacos. Their food is fresh, tasty and most importantly fast and friendly service. 10/10 recommend if you're looking for a place to eat in the airport",
      "Hiram Rodriguez was our server and he was super nice and attentive!Had the shrimp ceviche, tasty and fresh with full pieces of shrimp in a light lime sauce. Also ordered the Southwest Chicken salad which was okay, they use iceberg lettuce instead of field greens but the chicken has a nice blacked charred taste and was good! Boyfriend got chicken tenders and that sweet and sour sauce it comes with was so tasty!Also have lots of mixed drinks, decent wine selection and a few beers on tap (some were out when we were there though).Went here before my flight back home. It's right next to gate D24 after checkpoint 3 of American Airlines terminal. If you priority pass with Chase Sapphire Reserve or Capital One Venture X, you get dining credits here!"

      "The plan was to fly through Fort Lauderdale, and well, then the tropical storm came along and changed my plans entirely. As a result, I wound up flying from Miami on their latest flight to go northbound to Tallahassee. Consequently, because I'm an early bird and enjoy taking my time at an airport, I figured I should eat dinner there and La Carreta came to mind. I mean, why not? I only pass it every single time I'm in the American Airlines domestic terminal.There's also the caveat that I'm a terrible Cuban and had never actually eaten at one of these, despite my mother swearing up and down she loved this chain. Well, minus one time where her boliche wasn't up to par, but I'm entirely digressing here. Anyhow, last week the day finally came and I tried them. This La Carreta is separated into two sections: their café section for things to go and then a cafeteria-style area where you grab food and chat up the ladies working there.As soon as I saw the goods, I chose a flan, as well as a huge plate of ropa vieja, white rice, and maduros. I'd have ordered something alcoholic, but the line was long and I was getting hangry. I knew I had to eat and that was that. Paid at the end of the line, sat down, and happily began munching away. Have to say that the food wasn't half bad, although the ropa vieja made me want my own. I think my version of ropa vieja is way better, but you tell me. I think this restaurant's version is better than average, just not as good as some fine home cooking.The plates they serve you here, in typical fashion of any Cuban restaurant, are massive. I couldn't finish my meal at all and what was left of it (mainly white rice) made no sense to take with me. I did, however, take the flan with me. It was in a small container that easily fit in my carry-on luggage. It kept well and I ate it two days later sans problems. Can finally understand why my mother swore up and down about this chain, but I probably wouldn't go out of my way for them. My cooking has been gradually improving on the Cuban front and frankly there's another Cuban chain I prefer.",
      "I LOVE Cuban cuisine. I HATED La Carreta.  I left hungry.The food from the hot buffet line turned cold by the time I found a chair that wouldn't ruin my pants with its cracked surface.  The Carne con Papa was tough and flavorless.  The Ropa Vieja seemed to be the same meat slopped over with a bit of canned gravy. Nothing had any seasoning other than a little salt. The (likely frozen) mixed vegetables were boiled until they were soggy, shapeless, and senseless.  Maduros are a particular favorite of mine. Instead of giving a caramel-ly crispness, the edge that I nibbled tasted of rancid cooking oil.  The food quality was so poor that I was afraid to try anything else, like a Cortadito, which I dearly wanted.  The busman cleared the tables diligently, cleaned trays diligently, and diligently distributed mints plus toothpicks wearing his cleaning gloves!  Run, don't walk, away from this total waste of money.  I wasted mine on a virtually inedible meal.",
      "Craved an Empanada at the airport while waiting on transportation. I haven't had one in a while so I was looking forward to it.  I tried the chicken empanada and a ham and cheese empanada. I did not like the ham and cheese but likely my personal preference. The chicken was good although greasy. I was not impressed with the gnats flying all over the side table where the water and other items you can use were at. I also did not appreciate the attitudes of the employees working. They appeared to be bothered that I was there and they had to wait on me.  They didn't want to answer questions either. That aside I wanted to try them again so I am glad I did.  I now remember why I don't routinely order them at home.",
      "Looks pretty good. They have a breakfast buffet. But you only pass through it one time while staff place the items you want onto your plate. They also have empanadas that look better than the little stand elsewhere in the airport. I'll have to try all of this next time. It's located across from gate D37.",
      "I grabbed a chicken empanada on my way to board my flight. I wanted something light and flavorful. Pretty good empanada and the price is reasonable! This is located in concourse D of Miami airport near D38.",
      "Just a quick stop to check out what kind food other than pastries they serve and to get me some good old Cuban coffee. Their service was pretty quick like assembly line so we were in and out before we knew it. Got some guava pastries to eat and take home, wish I could take some of their coffee home also. Everyone should stop by here before boarding to pick up a treat and get yourself some coffee adults!",
      "This is the second time I have eaten here for airport food it is top notch .  It's not cheap but it's the airport also . We ordered churrasco steak very very tasty and the plantains was to die for couldn't get enough yellow rice was great like I said you would not expect this caliber from a airport but man it was good enough that I remember the place from a year ago nice it was right next to our gate home to San Francisco here we come it's been nice Florida",
      "Swung by here for some cheap eats while waiting for my flight. There were some similar shops that sell coffee, cuban pastries, and sandwiches, but this one seemed to have the longest lines and freshest pastries. After much contemplation, I decided on the guava and cheese pastelitos and the spinach and cheese empanada. They were both warm when they were handed to me! Meaning that the cheese in the empanada was nice and melty, while the guava cheese pastry was still flaky and crispy. I regretted not buying more to bring back home.",
      "The Cuban sandwich was a good size but I was waiting for the flavor to hit, I suspect the cold cuts used were not the freshest.Giving 4 stars because they had very friendly and through service, plenty of menu options and large dinning room.Their coffee and guava pastries were delicious! 5/5",
      "Food is good but Cashier n the girls who takes sandwich order are either  rude (or it's the language barrier?) It's cafeteria type of service, no table service. I had coffee which was really good."

      "We ordered for deliver since we had a Chinese food craving! We ordered the honey garlic chicken with noodles, sesame ginger chicken with fried rice, egg drop soup and a miso soup.  The food was actually good the egg drop soup was just perfect not too thick or salty. Both options of chicken were delicious and hit the spot. The noodles blew it out the park for us. The reason for 4 stars is because the fried rice was NOT GOOD we threw it out, the rice had no \"fried rice\" flavor the grains were very thin, it was just not it. The chicken was also soggy but that's due to delivery. We would order again and look forward to stopping by in person.",
      "Totally legit. New restaurant but food is good. Mongolian beef was perfect! You can order ahead or eat there.",
      "This place is great. A much needed hidden gem. Definitely try it and you will not be disappointed. The food comes out quickly and very fresh.",
      "What a great find in Downtown Miami! I've been looking for good Chinese food but at a reasonable price and Kitsune House delivers (figuratively and literally.) It's  a hole in the wall tiny spot adjacent to the historic Ingraham Building (site of the former fabulous Balloo Restaurant.) Most of the other customers came for take out. We decided to create our own happy hour and dine in (beware, they advertise wine but don't offer it yet, just beer and sake, hopefully they offer it soon.) We had apps, spring rolls and chicken dumplings and they were both fantastic, I'd put those dumplings among the best I've ever enjoyed. Best of all, the prices are quite reasonable, you can get a full meal from 12.99 up to 15.99 depending upon the protein you choose. (The apps were $7 each for 4 dumplings and 2 spring rolls.). Atmosphere is funky and fun. I'm a little confused because the decor and restaurant name are both Japanese, but the food is basically Chinese and Thai (except for the sake.)  I will definitely return for a full meal, but wanted to share my initial thoughts in the hopes they will get more business and thrive because Miami needs great food at reasonable prices and that's exactly what Kitsune House offers.",
      "My husband and I love this place! The service is good, food is great, and the wait time is not long after you order. It's a great little spot to grab a quick delicious Chinese/Thai/Asian meal. My office is downtown and this is my go to spot for lunch every time I work from the office. Would highly recommend!",
      "They're right down stairs of my office so it's fairly a quick walk down. The options is minimum but it's good! Been here twice for lunch and both times i got the mongolian beer with rice and egg drop soon, so good! They're super fast too like once i order, i only have to wait 5 minutes!"

      "Wow. I mean. I'm really at a loss for words. That doesn't really happen to me much but I must say this place is a hidden gem. I've lived in the area for YEARS and yesterday was my first time trying this spot. From the customer service, to the concept of the restaurant, to the flavors.... Everything was 10/10. We had The Sweet Dog and The Dolphins, both cut in half so that we could each try it and wow they did not disappoint. Every once in a while I crave a hot dog, and these fulfilled my cravings and more. The decor around the small restaurant is nostalgic as their theme is \"Miami Home Teams\" so they got the Wade and Bosh Jerseys and a few OG Dolphins ones as well. I can't wait to come back here and try more flavors.",
      "This place makes insanely good hot dogs. They've got a ton of different choices and really cool ingredients to choose from too. No matter what you're in the mood for, you can pretty much get a hot dog to scratch that itch. Great fries, sides, and milk shakes also. Service is also always great. Can't say enough good things about this place.",
      "Epic just epic try it if you haven't and get the popcorn on your way out. Classic sweet dog all day. Chris helped us and immediately made us feel welcome and taken care of. Keep going to Sweet Dogs.",
      "Sweet Dogs is the spot for amazing hot dogs or popcorn! It's a small joint that houses specialty hot dogs named after local sports teams or schools and amazing popcorn combos. They also have custom hot dogs if you're not into all the toppings, as well as other desserts like soft serve! Chef Jeo is incredible - so funny and incredibly great service. I went with a friend who had visited once before, and he remembered him after that one encounter months back. We ended up getting the Heat, the U, a side of mac and cheese, the Calle Ocho mix (Oreo, cheddar, and butter popcorn), and their new Crunchy Mix - Cinnamon Toast Crunch popcorn! Both hot dogs were so good. I preferred the U, but the Heat was also tasty with the chili and jalapeños. I loved the addition of corn chips on top for added crunch! The hot dogs had a great snap and were so juicy. I didn't get a chance to try the mac and cheese, but my friend enjoyed it. The popcorns are so delicious and addicting - not too sweet, with just the right mix of sweet and salty. I'm definitely coming back whenever I'm in the area and craving a good hot dog!",
      "The food here is just incredible. Definitely a nice little hole in the wall with options for anyone. I personally love the popcorn they make and you can never go wrong with the hotdogs. The Mac n' cheese is also a low key move so don't skip out on it. Just be ready for the limited space inside so keep that in mind when visiting but I definitely will continue to recommend this place if your looking for something to break the routine.",
      "What a gem to Miami!  Prolific Chris greeted us, recommended a few dogs... sweet dog special was delicious and the mozzarella sticks yum yum!Truly a nice surprise and will go back in tge neighborhood.",
      "All the hotdogs were excellent.  The service was very nice as well.  I'd give it 5 stars but deducted one star as they are not kosher hot dogs as advertised and noted in an earlier review.  Nathan's does not make kosher 1/4 pound hot dogs.",

We had the Cuban sandwich, beef picadillo special and some cafe con leches and I would order every one of these again. The Cuban was the best I've ever eaten EVER, and the rice, beans and plantains that came with the picadillo were out of this world!If you're in South Beach, Puerto Sagua is a must stop!!",
      "Great service Decent food Ordered vaca frita and ropa vieja two classic Cuban dishes I prefer my own recipes but it's a simple basic famous Cuban spot with average prices and centrally located",
      "Definitely a tourist trap. I have known this place for many years. There was actime where it was even a pleasure to eat at Puerto Sagua.Unfortunately, now it has become expensive with poor quality. The service could be infamous, depending on the waiter or waitress. However, some are very kind and efficient. I just would never go back.",
      "Listed by eaters as one of the top cuban restaurants in Miami, and out of their list, one of the only ones in the South Beach area.   So we intentionally walked a bit to come here.  In summary, the food was OK, the price was what you would expect in a tourist area (i.e. high)...thus one might as well stay closer to the more hopping areas of South Beach closer to our hotel if one is going to pay that price anyway.There is a huge indoor dining area, and some smaller tables near the sidewalk in front.  Since it was a beautiful day, we sat outside.  Ordered two sandwiches for lunch:  Large cuban sandwich $13.95, pulled pork sandwich ($15.95), both a-la-carte.   The cuban sandwich had all the requisite ingredients and it had been pressed, but the amount of ingredient and quality was something I would expect from a normal sandwich chain for less....not from a top Cuban sandwich in Miami...there just wasn't much pork or cheese (enough ham).   That wasn't a problem with the pulled pork sandwich...there was plenty of good, roasted pulled pork, mixed with some delicious onions.  But it was very dry, which was also a big problem with the cubano.  One doesn't really appreciate how much juiceness is important to a sandwich, until it goes missing.  Also got a $6.95 strawberry shake....it was OK, kinda small and very runny (more milk than ice cream), but tasted good.  Also ordered a side order of black beans and yellow ($8.95), which was fine but not worth $8.85.   So the lunch for two was well over $50.The service was mixed...got seated with a smile right away, and our food came out hot in a reasonable amount of time, and done dishes were taken away quickly.  But nobody ever asked us how the food was, and our water was never refilled (which both of us needed per my comment about dryness above).Wouldn't come back for lunch...maybe for a formal dinner when the higher priced seafood dishes could be justified.",
      "Service was good and my food came out really fast. I just got the ropa vieja and I admit I could've gone more adventurous. I'm from Southern California and I've tasted this dish from other places so I know what it should taste like. And when I got it I wasn't surprised. It tasted like ropa vieja, I don't know how much better I was expecting it to be. I wouldn't say it's the best I've had but it was a decent meal. I will say it was kinda on the pricey side.. a little over $20 for the ropa vieja, rice, and 3 plantains? I guess the meal did come with 3 slices of free bread too but still. I don't think I'll be coming back the next time I'm in town.",
      "If you want good, authentic Cuban food, then head over to Puerto Sagua. Walking in you'll see that the place has been around for some time (since 1968!), serving traditional Cuban food in a casual diner setting.For coffee I got the Cortadito, which is basically an espresso shot with milk. It was the perfect drink to start the day off. Strong aromatic coffee with milk and just enough sweetness to savor every single sip!For my meal I got the traditional Cuban Sandwich, which consists of ham, roasted pork, Swiss cheese, pickles, and mustard between two slices of Cuban bread. Everything about it was perfect, from the crispy outer layer of the bread to the combination of meats, cheese and pickles swirling together in an explosion of flavor as you bite into it.Speaking as a tourist from a place with very few Cuban restaurants, this is a place you don't want to miss out on when visiting Miami!",
      "I kicked things off with a Cuban Espresso & it was clutch. Very sweet, a good sweet. Gave me what I needed & set me right for my order, Chicken Stew.Chicken Stew was very flavorful. A good portion of chicken with mini boulder of a potato that went very well with everything. There was a side of rice & plantains that came with the meal, plantains are an automatic no matter where I go. Service was great & consistent. Daily Specials are on the menu. Plenty to choose from like onion soup, fried yuca... You name it. Nice view if you'd like to sit outside for a first timer like myself.",
      "Summary: still a solid lunch option, but too pricey to be considered a hidden gem or a cheap eatYears ago this was a no brainer for a solid meal in South Beach without having to dress up or splurge for overpriced food near the beach. I stopped by recently and the quality of food is still great - rice and black beans are top notch. But when your meals are now fully in the $20+ range, you're no longer in the cute / quirky dive spot category.  It's still a good lunch spot, but at this new price point there's hefty competition from pretty much any other half decent Cuban spot in Miami.  For a similar spot, try Havana 1957 (various locations in South Beach) - similar prices but much better vibe.PSA: double check your bill, as tips might be automatically included now (years ago they never used to do this).",
      "I was in Miami Beach and I began browsing on Yelp looking for a place with good Cuban food. I eventually found Puerto Sagua and I'm very glad I did. The place wasn't fancy, and the prices certainly reflected this. I believe my dish came out to about $12, for a TON of food: lechon (pork), yuca, black beans and rice. The food was excellent, and this was one of the few places (actually the only place) in Miami that I visited that did not automatically charge the tip in the bill. My girlfriend got a Cuban sandwich, and she was a little dismayed at the fact that it didn't come with alot of pickles, but it too was tasty. Definitely recommended if you want quick and good food.And to the reviewer who mentioned the cristal hot sauce - YES! thank you for that tip. It was very flavorful.",
      "Great place very authentic Cuban food! Got the ox tail, fish soup, and roast chicken!If you get the roast chicken make sure to ask for dark meat or they will screw you with a dry chicken breast!Other that I would only recommend the Ox tail, roast chicken and Pig feet.... The main best dish here is the black beans!"

Just theirMoney! I have had a long day with having my wallet stolen, just my luck , I'm on vacation in Miami, and decided to stop by ! It's storming and the parking lot is flooded! I come in soaking wet, they seat me immediately. After she adv me they don't take cash only card, just my luck I don't have anything but cash, I ask if the manger can have some sort of empathy  excepting cash this one night. Nope they turned me away!I had to Lyft back to my hotel! As I waited for my Lyft. They picked and choose who's order to bring to the back , they told \"certain\" they can't pick up there food in the back, must go out front in the rain.. smh",
      "Would come here once a week for a late night date night. The last visit was the visit that ruined the experience for me. Upon entering the parking lot the cars were packed in the lot. However, a spot opened up in the corner, no problem I'll park there and leave room so the person next to me can get in and out easily. Unfortunately that was not the case the person parked next to me must have been drunk or not paying attention and hit my car. The lot was so full of cars illegally parked that I guess the person tried to wedge out and hit my car and left. So the $100+ dinner is costing a few thousand now. Such a bummer- I called the manager to ask for camera footage and have yet to hear back if yes they do or no we do not have footage and I'm so sorry that this happened in OUR parking lot. I haven't heard anything. Very unprofessional management.While having dinner a car was trying to get out of the lot and kept honking their horn while we were having dinner it was really annoying and lasted for awhile. Food is good and when you ask for service the employees are nice. Ordering on an app is kinda weird at first but we got the hang of it now. The delivery guys out front are kind of a turnoff when going to dinner. They should have a pickup spot for them in the back of the restaurant. There are usually like 10-15 mopeds out front and cause unnecessary traffic.TIP:Don't park in the lot unless you don't care about your vehicle!!",
      "I really wanted to like this place and it's possible I picked a wrong time to come but I honestly don't think I'll come back to give it a second chance. There was not one thing that we ordered that we actually liked. First impression was great. Instagram-worthy decor and server was super nice. The concept of ordering through the app and being able to pay through the app as well was cool. You are able to split up the check as well so for those wanting to split and just pay for your own order makes it easy. We were unaware of this and did not come with any cash, they don't allow you to tip through the app. Sign outside stated touchless, cashless, tipless-something along that line but still a strange concept to me. When I asked the server that I was unable to leave a tip on the cc she said they don't do that, can leave cash if I wanted but not necessary. I honestly felt awful walking out not being able to leave a tip since we didn't bring any cash with us. The food was on the pricier end  for the quality you get so I guess they built tip into pricing but I honestly would have preferred that they add an auto gratuity at the end.  I'm unsure how I feel when I walked out. Upset that I couldn't tip the server or that we overpaid for below average quality food...I'm conflicted and confused. It was a rainy and muggy day as well so as we sat eating our food, was bombarded with gnats which really grossed me out. The manager did stop by to check on us and saw us swatting and being annoyed and she stated that it was bc of the weather. I started taking pics of what came out but after tasting the first 3 dishes just stopped bc we just were not happy with any of it. Maybe the gnats just grossed me out all together but the whole experience just left. A really bad taste in my mouth.",
      "This place is cool because it you want to find food after 1am this and ihop are the only things open. To me the food quality here is poor, Hit or miss if you actually order something good. The tables & chairs are never clean. I would say it's good that's good when your drunk.",

Sadly can't say my trip went very well as it's left me curled up in pain & puking for 48 hours. As you can tell, the photos also didn't turn out well due to the blue lights that were indoors, washed out all of the photos. Food was alright, nothing special, but after being in excruciating pain for the last two days I can't say I recommend going here",
      "Amazing. Soup to sushi to portions. Service was nice and its cashless touch less tipless only thru phone order and paid thru phone. Everything came out one by one and it was so good. But i didnt enjoy the mushy dumpling in the soup but das all. Avocado roll were tasty and the tempuras were crispy nd light.",
      "They are \"touchless \" which means QR code for menu and filling out complicated website to place your order and servers who stand around uselessly and don't have menus or take your order. You have to pay online too so you are on your phone all meal. Food was ok. Tip is included in prices which are a bit high.",
      "{takeout review} Always my go-to sushi takeout spot. Always extremely fresh and great presentation. I've tried a variety of their classic rolls and have never been disappointed with the quality.",
      "If you're looking for late night sushi and asian fare this is the SPOT. It's open super late (5 am to be exact!!). The sushi was just average, but again I give them points as it's excellent sushi when you consider the time of night. There's no other place that I know of open this late with similar quality sushi."

      "It's been a minute since I've shown some love to one of my favorite spots in Miami and on this #ThankYouThursday I'm revisiting my review of Jaguar.How many restaurants in Miami can say they have been open for over 17 years - that is seriously WILD! For as long as I can remember Jaguar in the Grove has been serving up my favorite ceviche in Miami. Their menu has some classics like the vuelve la vida ceviche, oriental (my personal fave), Celia's salad, and of course churrasco. You can find those on my heavy rotation regularly. I love Jaguar because it's a family owned business, and every guest does feel like family. While you can tell the recipes are prepared by a skilled Chef Oscar and his team, you also feel like you're stepping into your fave family member's home being served traditional latin american food.The service here is so friendly, and if you visit more than once they're sure to welcome you as a regular.They have amazing drinks as well and their happy hour is great.Visiting Jaguar is always a good idea, and today and every day I am thankful for you!",
      "Wow! Thank you for this kind review Diandra, we're thrilled to have you as a loyal guest of Jaguar Restaurant!",
      "When it comes to ceviche, Jaguar is my spot. I've been visiting this restaurant for years, and its great variety of the citrusy, fresh fish goodness is what keeps me coming back.If you've never been before, I would highly recommend getting a sampler of ceviche spoons. That way you can try a bunch of options before you settle on your spoon of goodness.It's always hard for me to decide between my top 3 - the Ceviche Nuevo, Oriental and Levanta Muertos.Typically, I get the large spoon and I've discovered that the restaurant will split two selections into one large spoon. This is beautiful for someone as wildly indecisive as me.The ceviche nuevo comes with an Aji amarillo sauce which I love to order with Calamari. The Levanta Muertos has a spicy kick to it and the ceviche oriental has all my favorite things - tuna, avocado and cilantro. In my opinion you can't go wrong when it comes to ceviche at Jaguar. It has been consistently delicious over the years, and keeps me coming back to this spot.There are other standouts here - like their happy hour. Ok real talk, food is better when you can enjoy some discounted cocktails and apps. They have 2x1 drinks and a bunch of bites priced at $5 or less.It's hard for me to order anything but the ceviche and appetizers here buuuut their other menu items are also good. Its a Latin American and Peruvian inspired menu so their really is something for everyone here. I love their tacos as well as the arroz con Mariscos.When dining here with friends, you must get the provoletta. It's an app of melted cheese topped with mushrooms and served with tortillas to scoop all that gooey goodness up.To me, one of the makings of a good restaurant choice is consistency. Although Jaguar may not have changed its spots over the years in terms of new menu items, it surely has kept me coming back for quality ceviche and generous wine pours over the years.",
      "Beautiful restaurant located next to a parking garage. Very well decorated and clean. Host at the front entrance was friendly but unfortunately service was bit off.  My order was taken twice by two different people and although there was no lunch rush the service was slow, however friendly. I order the salmon with grilled vegetables. The salmon was cooked well and was good on its own. The came with a 3 chili sauce which had no spice, lots of onions, and salty. The vegetables were underwhelming, a couple slices of bell pepper, 3 slices of zucchini, a slice of red onion and watercress in lemon. I expected a better selection of vegetables.",
      "We were stranded and hungry at Coconut Groves busiest area near Cocowalk... so many choices! And we decided to stop at Jaguar since it was listed as a \"taco spot\"Come to find out that while they do make good tacos and have a wicked super hot killer sauce, they are this \"Peruvian mix\" type restaurant with an apparently great ceviche as well!This time we went for their Mexican menu and ordered some Margaritas, chips with guacamole  and their Tacos- all the food was good/ their salsas were also good but beware of the one listed as super hot because: it IS super hot! LolAnyway, the place really starts popping later in the evening as it has a very long bar that seems to be a local favorite and so groups of people come in after 8pm and the vibe gets to be vivacious and chatty: love places like this for larger groups as well, you should stop by and check it out!Enjoy!",
      "We visited Jaguar for the first time, after passing by a handful of times while hanging out in the Grove. We had a great experience!The food was delicious and had powerful flavor. I was a little cautious ordering the steak tacos, as typically restaurants overcook the steak. Not Jaguar, the steak was so juicy and tender! All of the food we got was delicious, and the cocktails were yummy.They were fantastic about my dairy allergy and our server Joey was very nice and funny.",
      "Thank you for stopping by Liz! We're so glad you enjoyed your first visit! We can't wait to welcome you back to Jaguar Restaurant.",
      "We've been to Jaguar twice now, while hanging out in the Grove.The first time, we sat without any issues waiting and our server was super friendly and helpful. We loved the ceviche options and beans and rice ... it seems like simple choices, but takes a lot to make them yummy.The second time, I came to try their happy hour menu which was nice to enlighten even on the weekend. My friends and I enjoyed their wine selection and calamari, ceviche tostadas, and salads. We had the best drinks and food but our server went ghost... like, we legit had to go find him once and the second time we saw he left for the day!  Sitting outside shouldn't equal being left to our own devices, I think. I'll be back, as it's a great spot to hangout and eat great food but don't let anyone forget you!",
      "We've been here twice now, so I'm basing this review off of both Interactions.The first time, our server was great and we enjoyed tasting a few items on the menu. We loved the ceviche, the ease of seating, and the overall vibe. Happy hour is 4-7pm every day with plenty of options. This second time, the food was good and there was no problem sitting. However, the server left us twice and we had to get up and get assistance. The food was great and the runners were friendly and quick. I would've been happier without hunting down someone when needing something the second time. I will be back, but hope that trip will be the tie breaker ...",
      "We're happy to have stumbled upon Jaguar as a local Peruvian spot to dine at while in a Coconut grove. They have popular ceviche, classic bean and rice dishes, and something for everyone! I loved the grilled mahi lettuce wraps myself the best, and the passion fruit mojito! There's ample space inside and outside along with friendly staff.",
      "This place is like a hidden gem. I was pleasantly surprised with how different and unique the food and menu is. I would definitely recommend trying it out!",
      "Oh wow this is the best ceviche I have ever had. Also the most different options for ceviche I've ever seen- I wish I was with a bigger crowd so I could order one of each! The Black Market ceviche was definitely the table favorite, but honestly they were all so good, so much flavor. We had opted for the larger ceviche portions and that was a good call. While I could have gone all night eating just ceviche, I'm glad I also ordered the octopus, so tasty! My husband's Lomo Saltado was also very good. Naturally we had to get dessert, and the Palomas de Cajeta was incredible- a crepe with banana and cream with ice cream and a bit of dulce de leche. The service was really good, we were a sizable group that couldn't make up our minds and they were very patient with us. A pricey dinner but worth it!",
      "Lovely Peruvian favorites in the grove! A friend and I were able to walk in for a two top before the late crowd showed. The menu has both Peruvian and some \"Miami Latin for those who can't step out of the taco zone\". I enjoyed a well seasoned and properly medium cooked lomo saltado. My friend enjoyed the mahi. We both appreciated the spicy marg and a caipirinha. Indoor and outdoor seating are available. If you are visiting  Miami from the northern parts of the US please understand that open air with fans and not overly air conditioned places like this are the norm, and enjoy the authentic feel.",
      "Jaguar has a nice vibe to it, very laid back for lunch. I ordered the Lomo Saltado and saltado it was. I asked for rice on the side because the dish was too salty. Service was nice.",
      "My favorite lettuce wraps!!The ceviche oriental is also also super good!! I love coming here for a quick lunch with family and friends. Service is usually good and the food we've tried has always been great."

      "My friends and I were in town for a conference. One afternoon we just wanted to get away at lunch and have a drink and look at the water. IL Gabbiano was nearby and fit the bill. It had a nice outdoor patio, the staff was very pleasant, and I enjoyed the aesthetic.We only got drinks and then a dessert sampler (Dolci Assortiti). We had flourless chocolate cake, Tiramisù, cheesecake, and a couple other items. Overall we had a pretty good time. We didn't eat any food, but saw a number of very appetizing dishes brought out to other tables. The only knock on the restaurant is that it is relatively expensive. However this isn't a surprise, you pretty much know what you are getting up front;  It has white tablecloths and the staff are formally dressed. So I would not recommend this as a casual stop, but as long as you are looking for something a bit higher end I'd highly recommend it.",
      "This restaurant never disappoints - delicious food, exceptional service, and a beautiful view. I always get great feedback when I recommend Il Gabbiano. I was the first of my party to arrive, so I enjoyed an espresso martini at the bar.  To start things off, one of the servers, who had a beautiful Italian accent, recited the evening's specials. We ordered a few appetizers for the table, and we all ordered our own entrées, and to finish things off, we ordered a few desserts to share. I wish I took more pictures! Everyone enjoyed their food. I went for a business dinner with a party at five. We went at about 6 o'clock. The restaurant filled up about an hour later. I highly recommend you make a reservation. As for the seating, there is an indoor seating, outdoor seating, an indoor bar, and an outdoor bar. The indoor dining room is nice, but I prefer to sit on the terrace to enjoy the bay view. Due to the location, I believe valet is the only option for parking, or else you will have a hell of a walk since the restaurant is tucked away.",
      "Food is not fresh Your table not reserved when you get to restaurantExpensive Overpriced Unfriendly staff",
      "Excellent food and matching service. The waiter as well as everyone who assisted was courteous and extremely helpful. Appetizers, wine and the entree exceeded expectations. The view from the patio was fantastic. Had the veal and would highly recommend. Will definitely be coming back",
      "Talk about mouth watering food. Outstanding meal here the other night. Service is outstanding, servers are well trained, to provide while glove style service. We got a few bottles of wine and moet to start. Bruschetta and a piece of Parmesan is placed on your plate to start with a delicious bread basket for the table. Menu is in Italian for the most part, but the servers can answer any questions I opted for the saltimbocca omg SO good. Those with me got sea bass, bolognese, lobster ravioli, and shrimp dishes all left very happy. The cheesecake for dessert was phenomenal and we even topped it off while limoncello. I will absolutely be back.",
      "Came here for a business dinner. Our group (6 tables) were seated in the back private room.The menu was pre-selected with set selectionsand I just had to pick my main course.The food was amazing, course after course. Just when you think it was over, another dish of something would be placed before you. I don't even know where to begin and I even lost track of what we ate and wasn't able to take photos of everything...for our antipasta we were served fresh buffalo mozzarella & tomato salad, followed by salad and then--fresh ravioli and paparadelle. My entree was langoustine (shrimp)  and risotto--aside from it being a little salty for my taste, it was overall delicious. The risotto was perfect, the Arborio rice was not over-cooked and paired well with the shrimp. Dessert consisted of a tasting plate of flourless chocolate cake, Italian cheesecake & tiramisu.The servers were attentive and spoke Italian. The room had a gorgeous view of the bay.This is a wonderful restaurant, great ambiance and I recommend it for any occasion.",
      "From start to end this restaurant is a superb fine dining experience. The service is top notch, the food is quality and authentic, and the ambiance is breathtaking. Overlooking Miami's beautiful water views, right on biscayne - dining at Il Gabbiano is a perfect way to get a get a breath of fresh air, while watching boats pass by and enjoy a fantastic meal. To start, I'll say service is just 10/10. All the servers have the entire menu and specials memorized to perfection. They take the time to recommend dishes based on your liking, and palate and do a really good job to explain each menu item. While being greeted the servers naturally begin to place tomatoes, parmesan cheese and and bread on each individual plate, such a nice detailed touch! To share we got the calamari then each ordered our own entree. I mentioned to the server that my sister and I would be sharing our entrees so we could try a bit a both and they actually split the serving and platted it separately... amazing! We ordered a few bottles of wine and enjoyed a selection of different desserts, my favorites were the tiramisu and the creme brulee, both chefs rich in flavor but not overly sweet. I think what I loved the most of this spot is how underreated it was, I felt so present within ,y dining experience and shared a great time with my family - didn't even take out my phone once and that was great! Can't wait to go back again soon.",
      "Celebrated a friend's birthday here the other week. Had always enjoyed my meals here previously pre-Covid but this was my first time since and it was a different experience--not awful, but not great either.Not sure the size of our party, 9, made a difference but the veal chop I ordered was tough and brown--not white, implying a lower quality of meat (non-prime?) served. Ordered a side dish of penne amitriciana (which I have ordered countless number of other times elsewhere) and the sauce was just flat--nada de particular.The usual freebies were served prior to the entrees and the service was decent (though there was an AC issue necessitating the use of fans). Good Caesar salad and desserts.I was not particularly wowed with the main dishes from this most recent experience and might return but will not be in a hurry to do so. Wondering if this place has gone downhill or did I get them on an off night ??  A friend told me I didn't know what to order, as if a Veal Chop Parmigiana and red sauce pasta are Mexican cuisine....lol",
      "Love this restaurant, great water view!!!! And Great service!!!! staff is attentive and always on call For anything you might need. What to order: Branzino is huge and salted so perfect, they bring it to table so you can see it before they prepare it. The truffle risotto also a must get side, perfect combination for your choice of protein. ( rice is \" Al dente \" ), just like risotto needs to be!!!! The avocado shrimp appetizer wasn't so good but it was eatable. Overall great dining experience. The service here is second to none. They offer valet parking as well .... Will be back soon....",
      "This is a classic example of a restaurant that is expensive but is worth every penny!Service was amazing - the menu extensive and our group of 4 ordered different items - I started with octopus carpaccio was delicate and perfectly marinated- lamb chops (7) lollipops large and tender - my wife had Dover sole with angel hair prepared fresh - our guests had salmon and lobster ravioli- we sat looking out over the bay - beautiful- an extensive list of wines - two chose a Chianti and the others a Sauvignon!It was a wonderful change not to be rushed and able to converse and relax. The food price for 4 was about $400 and the wine $200 - we would have never complained if it was double that cost - the reason being we enjoyed the 3hours we spent and left having experienced a very memorable time together which rarely happens in most restaurants!We will definitely be returning!

      "Seaspice was amazing. It's a fantastic restaurant with a great view right on the Miami River. If you don't right you can catch the live music as the sun sets, and the restaurant transforms to a lounge. Totally worth coming Parking is tricky, and if you're not paying attention you might miss it as you drive by. But it's a gem worth coming back to.",
      "Seaspice is known to Miami locals as a very high end resturant, frequented by celebrities.  I have no idea why.  The service is pretty awful.  The drink runners are horrible.  It takes about 30 minutes for just a drink to be brought out to you.  The food is mediocre.  It is definitely NOT worth the price, which is very expensive.  I am giving two stars because the view is amazing.  Seaspice is right on the water and has a gorgeous ambiance.  You can watch yachts drive by and some will even pull up and park.  The other star is for the tres leches.  This dessert was AMAZING, I would go back just to eat it again.  But otherwise, Seaspice is nothing special.  Save your money.",
      "A place that tries to be high end but fails to deliver.Service ? Mediocre Food ? Below parFirst thing when you check in is they tell you that you have a 2 hr max(tacky)",
      "I read this was one of the best patio dining AND a hot spot for celebrities in Miami, so I had to go check it out on our recent travels to this area...Initially I was worried about our luggage situation, as we had to carry our luggage to the restaurant since this was our last stop in Miami. However, they were very accommodating, and let us store some of our stuff in the closet, and we kept the big luggage with us, near our table.As expected, the patio scene was spectacular...city skyline and seaside views, with plenty of yachts passing by! The place indeed had that chic celebrity vibe...truly FAB! Loved the music overhead as well. Somehow, I expected some snobbiness...but not at all. Service was great!Then the food. OMFG...I've had some amazing foods lately, but this takes the cake. Even the complimentary bread was amazing (and unique)! My husband ordered this Wagyu Burger, and I chose this Ragu Pappardelle ( THE best Ragu Pappardelle I've ever had...EVER. ). Then this Pavola dessert...again, just beyond delish. Truly, this was foods for the celebrities.Honestly, I'm shocked at how low the rating is for this place. I assume that if the service isn't top notch, it would probably piss some folks off. The pricing was on the outlandish side...with even lunch entrees starting at around 40. There was even an appetizer item priced at around 70 bucks! Luckily, like I said, I felt that the foods and the service (and especially the spectacular ambiance) made up for it. There was this big yacht parked right near us, which somewhat blocked some of the views from the left. Still, we got our eyeful of seaside/yachtside views.In any case, this was a great way to end our trip in Miami.",
      "Went here with a group of girlfriends for brunch and everything was delicious, they were super accommodating as well.I had the froze , a cucumber and gin cocktail and 2 grey goose and sodas and all were fantastic.As a table we split the fresh fish and a couple sides and it was delicious. Also love the free bread It is definitely on the pricier side overall tbh but great for a fun \"fancy\" brunch",
      "Came here for Miami spice and although we spent more than we thought we would, we had a good time. Everything was delicious. The kale Caesar had pecans and Granny Smith apple slices, never had a Caesar like this but it was a nice change! The Shrimp Pesto Whole Wheat Spaghetti was my favorite, even though I'm not the biggest fan of pesto. The burger was good too just a little messy from the truffle aioli. The chocolate cremoso and tres leches was very good but I'd go with the cremoso for the cocoa nib crumble, yum! All in all, I think it's overpriced and I probably won't come here again because of that. The cheapest bottle of Chardonnay was $75 and most drinks were $20. I only came here for Miami spice and still spent almost $200.",
      "Given we still have Miami Spice going on until the end of the month we decided to try out the lunch menu @ Seaspice gorgeous location on the Miami River, sitting outdoor is really relaxing, so beautiful to watch the boats go by, really lovely To start we had the Comte' Cheese Soufflé, I have to admit this was a bit disappointing, it really did not have the texture of a real soufflé  but then............ the Shrimp Pesto Whole Wheat Spaghetti and the Pan-Seared Chilean Seabass were really good as dessert, both the Tres Leches and the Chocolate Cremoso were yummy Try it out before Miami Spice ends, you can check out the Miami Spice Menus on miamiandthebeaches.com@seaspicemia",
      "First time for me at Seaspice, it is located on the banks of the Miami River it is a gem that you should not miss. Sit outside in the courtyard enjoy your food and a drinks while watching the boats go by, just beautiful We had the Miami Spice lunch which has a very affordable fix price 3 course menu for $ 28, unfortunately this will end soon, nevertheless, I would defiantly go back again for sureRegarding the Miami Spice menu only one observation, they should have had more than one choice for the Entrees without the extra charge, right now you have 4 choices and 3 of these have extra charge on it, not really fair given that you are promoting the Spice menu, you should have at least two or three choices included in the price and one or two with the extra charge We had had Prince Edward Island Mussels, Grilled, the Grilled Faroe Island Salmon and the Profiteroles and Peaches and Cream. My favorite where the Mussels, the garlic pizza bread they brought for the table was absolutely delicious, the Salmon was good too. I had the Peaches for dessert and it was ok, not really my thing, my friend said the Profiteroles were great, next time I will not opt for the healthy dessert We enjoyed all with a good Albariño wine, our experience was made especially enjoyable by our waiter Fabrizio, he was really great ! Thank you Fabrizio @seaspicemia",
      "Bad first impression. Its not a nice feeling to feel like you have to beg to spend your money at a restaurant. Every year I look forward to Miami Spice. It's a great way to try out various restaurants and a unique spread of menu options. Seaspice was on my radar and happened to be one of the participating restaurants offering the Miami Spice menu. I contacted the restaurant in advance and made a reservation for 3:30p for a party of four. My mom who is from out of town was excited to join us for lunch. I advised the restaurant we were doing the Miami Spice menu. The restaurant made it clear that they charge $50pp for No Shows. At 3:15pm, we arrived for our reservation. The hostess Karin greeted us, and advised us that they were running behind on the reservations and because of this they will not be able to offer the Miami Spice menu. Only the a la-carte menu will be offered. This was a bit upsetting because we drove almost an hour to get there and the restaurant is refusing to offer the Miami Spice promotion. Our natural instinct was to just say forget it we will go somewhere else. I mean, at the end of the day who wants to beg to spend their money? It's absurd. If the restaurant is offering a promotional menu and because to no fault of our own they are running behind why should we be penalized?My Mom looked so bummed out. Because she was so excited to try this place. I decided to walk back in and ask for a Manager. The Manager took 20min to come out. When he finally did come over, he introduced himself as Collin. I explained to him what was going on and it seemed as though he wasn't aware that the hostesses were turning Miami Spice customers away. He decided to make it right and advised Karin to honor the Miami Spice menu. Impressive! Things were turning around. Besides the encounter at the hostess stand, the restaurant is beautiful. It is situated on Miami's waterfront were you can view the million dollar yachts passing by. They also have docks for those interested in docking and dining. You can view the downtown city skyline which I am sure looks amazing at night.The food was excellent. The Miami Spice menu offered a three course lunch for $28. You have the choice of a starter (Kale Salad, Cheese Souffle, or White Gazpacho). A choice of entrees (Seabass, Chicken Breast, Shrimp Pesto Pasta, Wagyu Burger, or Plant Bowl). And a choice of dessert (Tres Leches or Chocolate Cremoso). They also offer the option to add a Glass of wine for and additional $12. I ordered the Comte Cheese Souffle, the Green Circle Farms Chicken Breast, and the Tres Leches. The others in my party ordered the Kale Salad, Gazpacho, and Seabass. For starters, My favorites were the Kale Caesar Salad and Cheese Souffle. The Kale Caesar had a mix of shredded Granny Smith apples, pecans and a creamy Caesar dressing. The cheese Souffle was like a fluffy egg Souffle with a cream parmesan sauce and tomato chutney. Delicious!For entrees, both the Seabass and Chicken breast were amazing. The Chicken breast was tender and juicy, served on top of a creamy polenta and topped with corn, peas, and mushrooms. The seabass was seared nicely to give a nice crunch on the outside, while perfectly flaky and moist on the inside. It was served with stewed garbanzo, Swiss chard, and smoked potato. For desserts, we all had Tres Leches. It was served in a small Mason jar topped with 3 milks, and berries. Perfect way to end the meal. The portions are not large but it is filling. The flavors are fresh and very well balanced. The food presentation was notable. The Watermelon Tequila drink was delightful and refreshing. The froze was also a big hit. The cocktails were presented well and created perfectly. We enjoyed everything. Our waiter, Austin was very friendly. He made great recommendations and was very attentive.An 18% gratuity was added to the tab. There are lots of street parking accessible. In the end, the food was great. Ambience was amazing. The hostesses can use additional customer service training and learn to use better judgment to improve the customers experience. There was no need to escalate the matters to a manager. It could have been handled properly by showing empathy, apologizing, and finding a solution to the problem.",
      "Hi Kim,Thank you for dining with us and leaving a detailed review. It has been forwarded to our management team. Our apologies for the confusion at the door.  Glad to hear Collin accommodated you and your experience was turned around.  We are happy to see your great feedback regarding the food, cocktails, and Austin’s Service.  Hopefully you will join us again in the near future!",
      "This is my second time going to sea spice & I normally love it as the first time. I never leave bad reviews But this second time MY PHONE WAS STOLEN AND SECURITIES DID NOThing about it. Instead we're trying to blame me for the situation. I'm not drunk nor was drunk. I walked in with 2 phone and walked out with 1.We came as my friend USUALLY does and this is how they treated us  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME. I thought it was 5 star so nothing could go wrong. With a security right next to our table my phone STILLL got stolen. It was on the table. And to whoever has the time to steal phones is just sad imagine what else they can steal... I wil ask to review cameras but with the way I was treated when I let them know I lost my phone I doubt they will be helpful but I'll let every platform form of review know that they steal phones here. I know the exact time frame as well so they wouldn't even have to look much at the cameras. Let's see. BTW I BEEN HOME SICK AFTER EATING THESE OYSTERS I COULDNT Even celebrate my baby's birthday w him.",
      "Came here for my birthday dinner with my boyfriend for a 7:15 reservation (we called in advance for an outdoor seat dock side) we waited about ten minutes after our arrival for our table to be ready at the bar, the short wait was definitely worth it. Started with an aperol spritz at the bar then ordered octopus and gazpacho to start. Octopus portion was good but the olive oil tasted burnt since it came out on a sizzling hot cast iron looking skillet (its very easy to overcook octopus, please just bring a regular plate next time.) I also had the whole main lobster. Extremely delicious large portion of perfectly cooked and seasoned lobster, bravo. My boyfriend had the truffle coated Chilean sea bass and he absolutely loved it. Vibe: 5/5 this place definitely is a scene but not overwhelmingly pretentious or obnoxious. Absolutely loved the music as well. Service:3/5 A bit slow, our server was very attentive when we were able to get his attention but we had to always wave him down. Food: 4/5 everything was honestly pretty good (octopus could've had a bit more attention to detail)",
      "Hi Liz,Thank you for celebrating your birthday with us!  We are so happy to hear you had a great experience and enjoyed the food.  Your feedback regarding the octopus has been sent to our chef. We look forward to seeing you again soon!"

      "Overall: Amazing food. We will definitely be back! The Great: - Biscetta allá Fiorantina. We got the serving for 2. Incredible. - Tiramisu OMG - get it. - Tableside Caesar - Very nice server - Ben - Foccacia bread The good: - Meatball App - The wine cellar and steak presentation as you walk in is a nice touch General feedback: - Dimming the lights a bit more would give it some real ambiance and a homier feel  - They JUST opened so cut the staff some slack. I've been on a team opening a restaurant before and it's so hard. They did great! - Good location - easy access with ample parking. A local steakhouse is just what the neighborhood needs - The staff was really sweet and everyone was really working hard all night.",
      "Went here for a birthday dinner. They have a great menu with all sorts of selections.  Our waiter was pushy and rude.  We ordered a NY Strip, Branzino, Pasta Bolonaize, Filet Minan, truffle fries and salad.  The steaks were ordered medium well done.  All the food was good except the steaks.  They kept bringing back the steaks rare and the waiter was angry with nasty comments toward us.  If you go here avoid this guy.  We told the mgr who seemed surprised.",
      "The staff and Marco was amazing! The food, absolutely Devine, the portion the flavor, the attention to detail were all perfection. Thank you for making my husband's 40th bday so memorable.",
      "Hello my name is Nick. Of course I'm from New York. I usually don't write reviews specially bad ones we got to this nice restaurant very gorgeous inside. The bread was delicious. I have to say the first course was a pasta dish we split. It had a Bolognese sauce on it it was served hot and good. Little did I know that was the highlight of a dinner. My steak came out first they cut it up which I wasn't crazy about but it was cold. my friends ordered a veal dish a special order. They accommodated them but the dish also was ice cold. The dish presentation was very nice but it being cold was definitely a problem. I must mention the sides to twice cook baked potato was a baked potato not twice cooked. The cream spinach was nice fresh baby spinach sautéed with melted cheese on top. The menu, said cream of spinach. I do wish they would get their act together, and I would even consider trying it again. The Decour is very elegant. It was Christmas Eve. We got there at 6:15 and it wasn't that busy. There was no excuse for the cold food. I must say I was very disappointed. My name is nick hogan.",
      "Nice bar.  Quality food.   Good service    Except bartender Angie.  Good wine and liquor selection",
      "Great new restaurant. Not crowded yet. We got frutti dimare and branzino, both dishes were excellent. I especially liked that unlike many other places they go easy on a salt. Highly recommend!",
      "Rippoff stupid place out of place Does not belong among working class neighborhood Just close down and go to Ball Harbor",
      "Ridiculous prices for a basic Italian restaurant It will never make it in NMB Will not bring lunch customers at this prices Dinner customers will go to a well known reliable restaurant",
      "My boyfriend and I had been waiting for what felt like an eternity for this place to open because we love Frank so we had to check out a place named after his iconic song. Just like his song, our experience was great! The place feels intimate and has a great ambiance for a date night. The food was also incredible! Yet, the best part was the service. Our server Andrea was so sweet and helpful the entire night. I highly recommend!",
      "One of the most authentic Italian restaurants I've ever eaten at!  First rate and class-  Look forward to having many more meals at My Way!  Thanks to the incredible staff for an incredible evening.",
      "Perfect place for date night! The food was amazing and the staff very friendly and attentive. Can not go wrong with the BURRATA CAPRESE for starter and my favorite the FILETTO DI MANZO! So many tasty options can't wait to go back next time I am in town!"

      "My favourite place in mia Consistence/ attractive menu/ great atmosphere and what to say about the dishes presentation: Just amazing!",
      "I keep my 5 starts to this gem!!!Every time I think about to go eat something fresh, beautifully plated and different I think ITAMAE ... and you can guess why based on my photos. I don't know you but for me the first impression is pretty important so if you see your food coming nicely plated, fresh and when you try it it's tasty, well... that's the place you can't never walk away.At this time we are just me and my husband (his favourite place too) so we decided to share some of their plates like Tuna tiradito/ white asparagus (was their special that day)/ classic ceviche/  Octopus Banadito and Spicy Tuna Maki Roll. Everything was delicious as always.we paired our lunch with a skin contact wine (Jaumet- orange taste). Delicated and perfect fornwhat we ordered.My fur baby was perfectly attended by our waiter this time, thank you for that. We appreciated.Like every time we visit this place, we are delighted.Can't wait to be back.Valet parking and Public parking in the area.",
      "You won't be disappointed ! That's a very nice gem in the heart of Miami design district.The food is amazing, menu on point, good wine menu. For sure, a pleasure to sit and enjoy a really good Peruvian-Japanese food.",
      "I might be a bit biased because Japanese and Peruvian cuisine are two of my favorites, but I thought this place was absolutely genius. The fusion of these two types of food seemed to blend together perfectly and left me wanting more, but my wallet wouldn't allow me to keep going XD. Itamae is definitely pricey, but I can promise that your tastebuds will leave happy. The menu had the date on it, so it made me believe that they change their selections pretty frequently, but I'm not 100% sure on that. On our menu, we had a nice selection of nigiri which were packed full of flavor and were near Omakase level. What I especially liked is that each piece had just a very slight spicy kick to it, not overwhelming but definitely noted. This carried on throughout most of the dishes we tried. Other highlights for me were the scallop bañaditos, and of course the cebiche, which was pretty much the main reason I wanted to come. One thing I will say is that the tuna tartar was pretty underwhelming -- it looked like canned tuna placed into a shallow plate. It was still pretty good, especially since they gave us nori sheets to eat it with, but I would say it's skippable.The servers were very friendly and extremely helpful when we asked for suggestions on what to get, not only for our food, but also for our wine selection. I (and the waiter) definitely recommend eating family style at this restaurant and just sharing a bunch of plates so that you can try as much as possible! Definitely recommend with the caveat of being prepared to spend a good bit of money :)",
      "Best Nikkei experience in MiamiFood 5/5 - absolutely no misses. As someone born and raised in Peru, I am always skeptical of Peruvian restaurants outside the country. However, we found Aiyana's to be truly authentic and refined without being pretentious or trying to reinvent the wheel. We ordered the ceviche tradicional, the bluefin tuna tiradito, the pulpo al olivo and the conchitas a la parmesana to begin with. Then, we tried the hon maguro and masu nigiri and finished with the grilled yellowtail. Environment 3/5 - while the outside seating area was pleasant enough, we would have preferred to sit indoors.Service 5/5 - our server was very helpful, informative and friendly. We felt very well taken care of, an appreciate an establishment that includes gratuity in the bill.Overall, could not recommend this place more when visiting the design district.",
      "Not at all what I expected from an outdoor mall spot but this place TRULY fights in the same ring with all the Michelin starred bad boys. Fast service + I LOVED the sweet potato that came with certain larger dishes & all the care put into presentation. One weird thing...I do wish there was a usable restroom inside the actual restaurant & not a football stadium's length away. 2 people spent $300 on food & to use the toilets we get sent across a long mall, up an escalator then another flight of stairs. That's kinda crazy. For the humans in heels, I wish they'd let diners use the one inside the restaurant. Other than that, incredible Nikkei.",
      "Hot items were not hot. Generally, flavor profiles lacked balance -- quite often toomuch acid. Have had better developed depth of umami in a leche de tigre in mom and pop outfits in Miami. Also think such a specific cuisine as Nikkei would be better suited located in some place other than the design center, home to clueless arrivistes. Then again, my expectations must have been too high since my phenomenal experience with like cuisine in Lima. I really wanted to love it",
      "This place is ridiculous.  Extremely expensive for small portions.  Guaranteed you will walk away hungry.  Tip is an automatic 20% but they tell you multiple times that the tip is shared and if you like to give extra tip for service.  What!!!  Are we really charging 150per person plus 20% plus asking for additional tip.  It is really disgusting where service and prices are in Miami.  Plus you are seated outside on some uncomfortable chairs.  Definitely not worth it regardless how tasty the small bites of food.",
      "I didn't know what to expect coming here. It's in the middle of design district and mainly outdoor seating. Parking is valet or street. The menu is intriguing but our waitress, Alexa did a great job at explaining everything. They only have wines and sake. We tried the potatoes, the ceviche, the conchitas and a nigiri. Everything was good and felt fresh. One downside is the restaurant does not have bathrooms. They are on the other side, upstairs of the square.",
      "This restaurant in the middle of the Design District was highly recommended by many websites and magazines so we wanted to try it for ourself. Eating outside on a nice evening is nice but in October it started raining on us. We were moved to the back alley next to the bathrooms which was not nice. The nigiri pieces were very small and you pay per piece.. The tuna dish was interesting - you use a small wooden spoon to put a bit on the seaweed nori which gets very messy using your hands. The mango dessert is too icy too. All the dishes are very small and pricey.",
      "Awesome meal, top to bottom. Great service, unique flavors, high quality fish (and ingredients in general) and just a really pleasant experience. Non-assuming place, a little expensive but totally worth it -- food was awesome",
      "I saw Itamae on the 2021 NYT list of best restaurants and knew I had to check it out since I was going to Miami for a business trip. I looked at their Instagram and saw the most beautiful (and beautifully plated) dishes of mostly raw seafood (drool). I had also never had Japanese-Peruvian/Nikkei cuisine before so I was stoked.This was my first time in the Miami design district, and it's really a beautiful and upscale area. The shops are really fun to look at, and it's very artsy as well. When we got to the restaurant, the service was fantastic and very kind, attentive, and caring to make sure we were enjoying our experience. I don't really remember what we ordered but we ordered pretty much the whole menu to share as a group (not all is pictured), and while everything was an adventure and delicious, my favorites were the 2 soft shell crab dishes, and the dessert. Everything on the menu was very special and creative and it was a great experience.I do have to say that it was a little inconvenient that you can't make a reservation for a party larger than 4 without emailing them, and it's challenging because they don't have a phone number so modifying the reservation is tough since you can't just call. Still, it wasn't too hard to get the reservation and I was so excited."

      "Baiocco is Excellent!!!Baiocco is truly an Italian cuisine staple.From the moment you walk in you feel like you just transported out to an of the beaten path restaurant somewhere in the outskirts of Rome.Everyone here was Italian including most of the people eating at the restaurant. I have been wanting to come here for a while until we decided to give it a try. The restaurant is charming and very cozy.You can feel the love and warmth of the people that work here. Attention is very noticeable and they were all very attentive and efficient.We had a few appetizers worth mentioning.The fried artichokes and also the rice croquettes... incredibly good  .For main course we had pastas from their daily specials;  pacchieri with tuna and also the linguini with mushrooms. This was the best pasta I've had in a long time. Fresh pasta and mushrooms... sauce was delicious. Light but packing a ton of flavor.The wine list is very good without being pretentious. Mango Panna cotta dessert was a highlight. Creamy, luscious not overly sweet.I can't wait to come back here and try new things.",

      "We decided to go out to eat for New Year's Eve and made reservations here.  Right off the bat, we wanted to order our drinks so we can toast and review the menu but the server said we had to order drinks, appetizer and dinner all at once.   She said because it was New Year's Eve, she had a different process to taking our order.  OK, understandable, I guess.  So after she took our order we waited for our drinks and eventually received WINE glasses for the champagne.  They stated they ran out of champagne cups and the wine glasses were all they had.  Ok, we had no other choice (Poor planning as it is tradition to celebrate the new year with champagne). Two of us ordered beer and looks like they ran out of beer glasses as they severed the beer in the same small cups as the water.  The food comes out, which was good, rang in the new year while eating desert and it was time for the check.  We gave her cash and split the remaining balance on three credit cards.  She came back complaining (in Italian) something that the credit card system is asking how much tip but the tip was already automatically included in the bill and really none of us understood as she was speaking in Italian.  We ordered our food either in English or Spanish and she understood us but when we asked her to speak English or Spanish so we could understand what she was saying, she said the restaurant is an international restaurant and they speak Italian and if we don't like it we should have stayed home (in clear spanish). What?  On the way home, my son brought up a good point.  No matter how great the food was, there is no reason to go back there.  There are many great restaurants in Miami that have great food AND great service, and there is no reason to go back for great food but poor service.  I think I'm going to take my son's advice!",
      "Went for my fiancée's birthday. Calamari and bolognese were good, mushroom tagliatelle tasted like canned mushrooms. Horrible service, mediocre food took over an hour. Would not go back.",

      "Been looking for a good authentic Greek restaurant in Coral Gables for a while and found a good one in Giralda Avenue. Calista Greek Restaurant doest look like much from the outside. They have a wine and beer bar and small tables with a simple decor, but magic happens when you start to order.Our waiter was very friendly and helpful with selections. I asked for a cold beer as it's a very hot South Florida evening and they came through with and ice cold bottle and chilled glass. We ordered their most popular appetizer 'octopus\" and it was cooked to perfection and very delicious. I followed up with the Bronzino fish fillet and also very good. Before calling it a night they served us a very delicious dessert (can't remember Greek name) and was a great finally to a great time and meal in this new place.Did I mention that owner is at front door welcoming all customers and she checked on us quite often to make sure we were having an enjoyable experience.. Highly recommend this place with 5 stars,",
      "Avoid sitting inside at all cost. Once inside you're basically packed like a bunch of sardines. People sitting inside had no manners or decency... we were forced to listen to this elderly women loudly go on and on about how crappy her daughter in law is etc. We barely saw our waiter.  Everything needed salt.  I highly recommend asking for a side of tzatziki, it'll make everything much tolerable. It took a whole 40 minutes to receive our food... At that point I would've gone to anywhere else on the strip.  It's also very warm inside as they keep the front door open.",
      "Calista = Greek heaven.  The food was phenomenal. Such simplicity in their style of preparing dishes but somehow the flavors manage to blow your mind. Service was absolutely perfect. Quick turn around time for such excellent food too. Calista does not take reservations however you can call ahead to let them know of your arrival time and they will do whatever they can to accommodate you.  Did I mention their Galaktoboureko on the house? Well, let me tell you. Not only is it complimentary but it's so damn good. You won't regret trying the following:Any of their fresh catch - (make sure to ask for the market price prior to ordering)Plevrakia (literally falls off of the bone)Lemon potatoes The chefs passion for incredible Greek cuisine shines bright here. If I could rate it 10 stars, I would! **********",
      "Calista would get more stars if it was an option. The service was absolutely incredible from the start. It was a busy Friday night on Giralda and the kind hostess sat us immediately outside. A table opened up indoors and she rushed us inside due to the unpredictable weather. The little things count and hospitality is priceless to me. For dinner we had the house white wine which paired perfectly with the red snapper special on the menu. The lemon potatoes and beets for sides were so delicious and let me not forget the starter of lamb ribs which were so tender and unforgettable. Dip them in the house Tzakiki and I promise you will want more. To top this experience off they gave us complimentary dessert. Unheard of. Calista you have a special plane in my heart.",
      "Walked into this adorable dinner spot for an impromptu date night. Once you step inside the inviting restaurant front, you are surrounded by pink flowering bougainvillea trellises and classic Greek cyan motifs. We were seated opposite the bar and ordered octopus and calamari to start, followed by chicken kebabs and shrimp stuffed with crabs, which were seasoned to perfection and served with hearty grilled asparagus and lemon potatoes. Our servers were so hospitable and walked us through the dinner specials featuring seafood, from start to finish, and kindly treated us to complimentary classic Greek dessert, a semolina custard between layers of phyllo pastry, which was made in house. If you are looking for a memorable Mediterranean seafood restaurant for date night, then I highly recommend Calista Taverna.",
      "Great Greek place! We went for the first time taking advantage of the Sip & Savor event of Coral Gables where you get drink and appetizers for a certain price. We had a Frose and fried calamari. Loved the food and flavors. Would recommend the dips appetizer to try, really tasty, you have 5 options to choose from.At the end we got complimentary dessert and it was really delicious, the name was galactoboureko and was something like pudin with pastry, smooth and crispy.Would go back to try the other options!",
      "WHOA. I just had the best food I've ever had in South Florida. Most amazing Octopus, lamb appetizer, calamari, and tzatziki app.I couldn't don't without the taramosalata even though my husband loved it. This will be my new go to! Such a cute location, great space, exceptional service and quality food. Great for family lunch/dinner.Can't wait to be back! Owner recently opened and came here from Queens, NY woot woot! (Just like me!)",
      "This may be one of the best Greek places we've ever been to in Miami. Everything is amazing. We loved the chicken kebabs and swordfish steak. Cooked perfectly and slightly charred. We loved the lemon potatoes and broccolini as sides. Their Greek salad tasted great and came with a huge piece of high quality feta cheese that didn't taste store bought. The Greek wine was also great. We got a free dessert at the end which was delicious. The only thing I would recommend if I'm being picky is that i wished they sold Greek beer on tap. They have monopolio which although good, it's Mexican beer.  Perhaps mythos? Anyway I'll definitely be back",
      "I believe that this is one of the best restaurants on Giralda. Great energy, great service and nice looking. The food is DELICIOUS. The drinks on point. I truly recommend it.",
      "Well we decided on an impromptu dinner tonight with some good friends and my buddy's girlfriend Ruth came up with the idea to visit Calista Greek Seafood tonight as some good friends of hers recommended it to her.  Long story short we were all very, very glad that she did.  Calista is in the heart of the Gables and pretty easy to get to as well.  Parking as usual is a problem in the Gables but no worries you should be able to find some parking in the street near the restaurant.  Once we got there our friends were already at the bar but not a full bar gang so be prepared to get your beer and wine on.  After a bit our table was ready and we got down to business.  To start we ordered the Grilled Octopus appetizer and Calisto veggie chips with tzatsiki sauce which were both awesome!  They also brought us some Greek style bread in a basket, warm and of course with plenty of Olive oil in tote.  For our main courses and sides we chatted with our sever Martina who was very helpful and we opted for the Grilled Dorado (Whole Fish), the Moussaka and the Broiled Scallops (Greek Style).  All of them were excellent and no need to worry on the fish guys, they debone and serve it ready to go.  For side dishes we went with the Grilled Asparagus, Lemon Baked Potatoes, Sautéed Broccoli and the Calisto Fries (w/ Feta Cheese) which were all very tasty as well.  I have to say it did take awhile for us to get our meal but it was well worth the wait.  Patience is a virtue everyone and besides that's what wine, appetizers, good friends and conversations are for, you don't want to rush a good dinner right?Presentation on all the food items was excellent and I would be remiss if Isis not comment on the excellent service they provided from the minute we arrived until we left.  One item that does need a little improvement is the air conditioning though as it was a little warm.  I think most of the tables that are near the front door experienced this as there was a lot of foot traffic.  Possibly an air curtain at the front door would help keep the cold air in.  If you like dining \"Al Fresco\" no need to worry their item as they do have tables outside that are great for dining under the stars and people watching as well.  So in closing I will say that this restaurant is definitely worth visiting and if you do decide to give them a shot, try to get their early as they do not take reservations and it is first come first serve.  We will certainly be trying them out for lunch next.  Enjoy and Bon Appétit!"

      "nice atmosphere, great food and warm service@Madeleine! I ordered the octopus(gnocchi al pesto con purpose anticuchero) and it's the best I've ever had",
      "This is not your typical Peruvian joint. They have dishes I've never would've expected but did not disappoint at all. Let me start by saying that service is amazing, more specifically the service I received from Madeleine who's just the best and sweetest waitress. Very attentive at all times, great smile and a welcoming personality. Ambiance is perfect for groups and families but fine for a single guest. Now as far as the food on boy I wasn't ready for this level of deliciousness. Starting with the caipirinha which was not only delicious but packed a nice punch, so much that the second one had me in my feelings lol. First appetizer: the pork belly tapas....think of semi crunchy pork belly on toast topped with sriracha sauce, and you taste the perfect bite. I assume that the small dots of sauce on the side are made with cilantro but is doesn't even matter. All I know is that mixing the small tapas with that sauce was heavenly. Main dish: now this I wasn't ready for...fettuccine carbonara topped with shrimp and lomo stroganoff(filet mignon) topped with bell peppers. You wouldn't expect a Peruvian joint to absolutely kill it with the carbonara but these chefs definitely did. And the the filet mignon cooked to perfection, medium for me, and all the juices oozing and mixing with the mushroom sauce was my idea of foodgasm. They have a lot of unique dishes with pictures on the menu that had me undecided on what to pick for like 20 minutes and you know a restaurant with a menu like this is hard to find. You best believe I'm coming back first change I get. Just so you know and it doesn't surprise you, my check came with a 20% included gratuity which I was ok with since I enjoyed my meal and service.",
      "Manta was delicious and fun! It was one of my favorite restaurants we stumbled upon during our Miami trip. We decided to walk in after seeing high ratings from both Yelp and Google.I got Fettuccine a la carbonara con lomo stroganoff and it could have easily been two meals... both the stroganoff and carbonara were entree sized. And given the portion size the value was good too. The service was decent too.The only downside was that the servers were very forceful and adamant about leaving reviews (we felt forced to connect to wifi and write review at the spot) which I didn't feel very comfortable with. Leaving reviews is a customer's rights, not something they can enforce. Because this experience wasn't the most positive I even contemplated leaving 4 stars. I hope they can fix this about the service and make the dining experience more comfortable going forward.",
      "Manta was spectacular! Was a little skeptical but sooooo glad we stood. We skipped the appetizers and went straight to the main course since it was getting late. We ordered the Chofan which had  (shrimp, chicken, calamari, pork, steak) and the ribeye with lobster fettuccini. The food was super delicious m, we can't wait to go back. The chofan was delicious all of the flavors complimented one another the ribeye was made to perfection. The lobster fettuccini was hands down the best cheesy, moist and a good amount of lobster. The portions are generous, so be prepared to bring a goodie bag home. We topped the meal off with a slice of chocolate cake which comes with ice cream. I have no words it was great! The staff was super accommodating and friendly. If you're ever in the area make sure to stop by Manta, they really know how to treat their customers and how to cook delicious meals.",

Súper recomendados!  Lo único que no me gusto personalmente es que no tienen arroz con pollo ni ají de gallina porque son un restaurante orientado a mariscos. Volveremos",
      "Ridiculously delicious!! Casual spot with amazing food!! Had a really sweet server, Victoria, who made our dining experience lovely. Ordered a drink (Paloma) appetizers and main courses. I was full from the appetizer and couldn't even finish my main course (salmon). Really fresh food, unique dishes, and very flavorful. It was a recommendation from someone who worked at the selfie museum down the street and it didn't disappoint. Delicious!",
      "I was excited to try Manta as it has great reviews and I was craving Peruvian cuisine. I arrived and was seated promptly at a table. The music is very loud for the middle of the day so it was a bit distracting. I was seated at the booth and unfortunately the booth sunk and was not stable so we moved to another table. Service was pretty good, as staff was attentive. The table was quite dusty and so were the cups of water. The server gave us new cups once I asked. We started with the classic ceviche ($18). It was not the best. The mahi mahi was cut in big chunks, was super fishy and not very tender. The flavor was off. I also ordered two pisco sours ($15 each). One passion fruit and one standard. They were pretty tasty but could have used more alcohol and less sweetness. My entree was pesto fettuccini with mahi mahi ($21). I was afraid the mahi mahi would be overly fishy but luckily as it was breaded and cooked it had better flavor than the ceviche. It didn't taste the freshest though, and seemed like it was a pre-breaded frozen mahi mahi filet piece. The pesto pasta was pretty good. It was definitely the highlight of the meal. A 20% tip was charged at the end automatically so at least it was reliable service. I thought it was a bit overpriced for what it was and was looking for more authentic bites.",
      "Delicious!!First time visiting Manta and honestly very pleased! Lunch was great, food was delicious, super tasty and creative. we ordered some plates to share like their causa (ceviche), risotto apaltado y lomo saltado. Omg!!! So good.Jose (our server) was ultra attentive, nice and gave us nice suggestions. We appreciated it.for sure , recommended! Public parking Availabe Pet friendly Average noiseGreat staff",
      "Manta was one of the foodie highlights of our Miami trip. Truly show stopping Peruvian food.We started with ceviche-- and I kid you not-- this was my favorite ceviche I've had. Tender, melt in your mouth, but still sizable chunks. The sauce was punchy and flavorful.For the main course, we ordered lomo saltado and the filete a la parrilla con puré de espinaca (mahi mahi with spinach/potato purée and a mushroom sauce). The lomo was tender and delicious, and I loved how flavorful the sauce was. The fries were solid too. The mahi mahi was cooked perfectly and flaked in my mouth, and the spinach, potato, and mushroom flavors all came together well. Yum!We also ordered a special cocktail, and while I can't remember the name now, it was pisco based and had honey. It was sort of frothy and creamy. Would highly recommend if it's still on the menu.Shoutout to our server Ruben who made good recommendations and made sure we had a great experience!",
      "Nice Peruvian restaurant located in Wynwood. The food and service were good. I tried the Ceviche Trio and loved it. Also, the grilled octopus was good."

      "The vegan bowl is so good . I think my favorite part was the mix of plantain fries and whatever the other stuff is lol. I thing it was the roti but it had eggplant or something but it was great.",
      "Thank you for the review. Eggplant means what you ordered was the vegan bowl with the Haitian Ratatouille (toofay)  :-)",
      "I love when I see my Haitian caribbean represented in places like this food hall, the Citadel. I did like the concept of ordering different foods from different restaurants and sharing them with friends and family. I had the jerk shrimp bowl with black mushroom rice (Diri Djon Djon) and a side of fried plantains (bunan peze). The food tasted good! I would have wanted a little more conch into the fritter and The pikliz definitely needed some spice, it was more like a cole slaw than pikliz. But overall yummy",
      "Horrible....service and food. Visiting Miami and upset for $50 my food came out entirely wrong. Not only was the service horrible (counter and kitchen being run by 2 very young employees) the food was bad. First the menu options were down to 4. Then when our food was ready everything was mixed up. When I pointed out the orders were completely mixed up they gave blank stares and no solution. At this point after a 4 hour flight and waiting 45 minutes for our food my husband didn't want to argue with children. When we finally did eat we gave each other blank stares. Only our meats were tolerable. The rest was trashed. Very disappointing way to start a stay in Miami.",
      "Food was pretty good, but I will say don't expect the authentic ting. The jerk or curry isn't Jamaican style, it isn't spicy, it's not the REAL jerk, but it is good. Mostly everything had somewhat a sweet taste to it. Not bad just not what I expected when I ordered my food.",
      "4 1/2 stars. Located in the Citadel, Manjay is Caribbean food with a twist. On our first visit we got the Jerk Chicken Bites and were in heaven.  This is not traditional jerk chicken at all and some purist might have an issue with this dish. These are small fried chicken nuggets tossed in a delicious jerk sauce. The chicken is fried fresh and is hot when it gets to your table. Overall, with the dish is a must have. On our second visit we ordered the chicken bowl which was the same chicken with two sides.  We tried several sides including plantain fries spicy slaw and veggies and they were all good. We particularly liked the plantain fries. We also tried the Coco Loco Shrimp on our second visit. This dish was okay but could have used a bit more flavor. Not something I would order again.The guys at the counter are friendly. Definitely more we would like to explore here.",
      "I've been to The Citadel a few times, but finally decided to try Manjay last night. The person taking my order was SO kind and took the time to answer all my questions and make recommendations. I went with the jerk chicken bowl with white rice, plantain fries and pikliz (spicy slaw). It was INCREDIBLE! Amazing flavor, perfect textures and a hearty portion. I let my boyfriend try and the first words out of his mouth were, \"I'm getting that next time we come.\" I'm also excited to try more from this spot!",
      "LOVED THIS PLACE, located inside the citadel which is a Food Hall with a nice bar, serving cool cocktails, sustainable retailers, live music & a rooftop lounge.The place is cool and hip, nice tables and friendly vendors and customers. Started out with the CONCH FRITTERS which is one of my favorite seafood things to eat and I loved them, they were fresh, perfectly fried and had so much taste. The JERK CHICKEN was my favorite dish of the whole experience, the chicken had so much taste and I literally couldn't eat it fast enough. THE COCO LOCO SHRIMP BOWL was also good, loved the rice and fries, the grilled shrimp could of had more taste but it was still very good. The CORN I could skip, was a bit stale and hard to eat at times. The guys that run the business were very friendly and recommended the items people like the most. I will definitely be back here to try more stuff and have more jerk chicken and conch fritters!",
      "The food was really good. The only thing that wasn't on point was the jerk chicken. It was good, but it didn't really taste like jerk. It was just sweet chicken. The curry shrimp should of been more saucie and the fritters were fire!. Good food overall.",
      "The quality of this place has declined exponentially. My photos are from my first experience years ago and it was great. During my pregnancy it was literally all I wanted to eat that's how good it was but due to changes in staff and management it has consistently worsened. It's really sad to see such an authentic place be ruined.",
      "My best friend sent me this place to try all the way from Tallahassee and I'm glad I stumbled in. This place is located in The Citadel and after a long day it was the perfect place to decompress and relax. especially with good food!I ordered the Vegan Roti and the Conch Fritters. Now, I don't like curry and have never tried Roti before but when I say I was impressed, I definitely was! It was a light meal that didn't make me feel sluggish at all, very much revived. I also got the Conch Fritters because I love seafood and though it was a little doughy it was also filled with conch which was a pleasure. They used a spicy dijon mustard sauce over the top that added great flavor. They added a sort of pikliz on the side and I was in love with the spice! I sometimes mixed it with the sweet roti the level it up a little. This place has great food in a good location and the service was brief but good as well. Stop by and visit theI've come back 3 times and i'm hooked!",

But you essentially get 6 tacos if you split the insides in 1/2 ..but they were so good that I decided not to split it this time and kept the delicious tortillas for my morning eggs We were about to leave but we decided to get some quesadillas con carnitas and let me tell you... they were outstanding!!! I also had frozen margaritas and they were perfect! Not too sweet and not too bland.Check out this hidden gem by the airport! It reminds me of Mexico City!  Mucha Gracias!!!Volveré!",
      "We were looking for a Taco Tuesday deal and we found it!! OMG, these tacos are soooooo delicious!!! The restaurant is colorful and makes you feel happy and you can enjoy your tacos inside or take them to go! They are made with corn tortillas and the meat is delicious! We tried carnitas, pastor, and pollo. The salsas that accompany them are fresh and flavorful too! The servers are attentive and we really enjoyed coming here. If I'm in town... I might be back next Tuesday!!! Thanks for making such delicious tacos!",
      "For this are is not a bad place.. we have only cuban places around so this is a nice change however the food is not to go crazy about Margarita was standard, guacamole was tasty, corn had melted american cheese not white cheese , tostada as also ok.Will I come back? Probably :) like I said.. is not bad but also not something you craved",
      "My father & I are self professed Mexican food connoisseurs & are always on the lookout for new spots. Recently, on our way to have breakfast at one of our usual spots (El Caribe), we spotted this place. We almost made a u-turn but instead continued on our way while I looked it up. After reading the favorable reviews and happening upon their Taco Tuesday deal ($1.50 tacos!) we decided we'd be back. Yesterday was the day & we were immediately impressed as soon as we walked in. Absolutely obsessed with the bright, cheery & colorful decor. We sat down and although it WAS a Tuesday, we instead chose other things off the menu. To start we ordered the Guacamole. Absolutely delicious & I loved both the red & pale green spicy sauces they brought out. For mains, my dad had the Chicken Nachos & I chose the Pescado a la Veracruzana & an Elote. Everything was incredible! My fish was perfectly seasoned & cooked. Somehow, they managed to maintain the crispiness of the fillet  (it was lightly fried but not at all greasy) at all) while covered in a wonderful tomato, pepper & onion sauce. It was fantastic with a deep, hearty flavour yet somehow felt light. Served on thd side was white rice & some of the BEST beans I've ever had. Just delicious! My dad's nachos we also fantastic & the margaritas?!?! AMAZING & very strong. Cannot recommend this little spot enough. Can't wait to go back soon!",
      "Nice little family owned spot and close to the airport. Supporting the small businesses as much as we can.Did not want to deal with the Palmetto after landing at MIA so decided to use Yelp and find a little easy spot nearby. Not disappointed by this one. Not the best imo, by far not, but it was definitely decent and enjoyed a nice meal.!Ordered a large guac & some flauntas for the kids and a couple of taco's for myself. Everything tasted 4/5. Steak was a bit dry but pork and fish taco's were good.Little spot, tables well apart from others and a clean bathroom. Friendly and appreciative service.",
      "I went to this place for a takeout order and went off peoples reviews. I ordered the chicken flautas platter and was pleasantly surprised with how yummy it was as well as the serving . I called in the order and it was ready within 15 minutes. The lady at the window was very nice as well. Will definitely check it out again and try some more items on the menu.",
      "I came here because I saw good reviews. It didn't live up to the expectation. Yellow cheese is not Mexican, somehow my tostada had melted yellow cheese. The salsa could be better and spicier. My taco was sad, needed more cilantro and onion, and tortillas that aren't \"talludas\" or \"stale\". Anywho, the only thing I really liked was the horchata. It was actually homemade and delicious. This place is more of a basic Tex-Mex.",
      "Delicious little hole in the wall, a little sketchy outside, food took long even though we were the only ones there but let me tell you It was worth the wait, it was Delish!  Best way to end my trip. I had a carnitas taco, a asada sope, & shared menudo  to drink I had a Modelo Michelada & pineapple jaritos",
      "Once again this little family owned taqueria didn't disappoint.  I ordered 3 carnitas tacos and they were so good!!!  It comes with a little serving of chips and homemade salsa.  I'm not sure what the green stuff is but it's pretty tasty too.  The food is always fresh and always delicious!  The people that work here are always so friendly.  I highly recommend if you are in the area.",
      "The carne asada burrito was fantastic. Chips they have at the beginning lacked quantity. Service amazing! Food was something I would come back for",
      "Wow!! Love at first bite. Stopped in for a quick lunch today, just happened to be taco Tuesday... where do I begin? The salsas are the real deal. Delicious. Fresh tortilla chips. Had the tacos Al Pastor; best in class... I inhaled them with a cold beer. Oh yes, and their taco Tuesday is also unheard of in Miami. Three tacos and a Modelo especial for under $10. I left 100% tip and felt I underpaid. Can't wait to come back!"

      "These were amazing sandwiches. If I lived in Miami, this would be my go-to joint. I came here with my cousin for dinner one night. I got smokes salmon and Brie on a baguette. My cousin ordered Italian meats and mozzarella on a croissant. We gobbled them up and left no crumbs behind. All of the ingredients were fresh! You can taste the quality in their products and ingredients.The wait staff was very friendly and cracked some jokes with us while we waited for our food. I highly recommend this place.",
      "Stopped by after getting off a cruise in Miami, waiting for my flight back to Jersey. This spot was actually recommended to me by a friend who lived in Miami!We arrived pretty early, around 11:30am so it wasn't crowded at all. I love how they have fresh smoothies on their menu so I definitely had to order one right after eating the cruise food haha! The rainbow smoothie was super refreshing; strawberries, peach, blueberries, kiwi & banana.Now of course I had to order a sandwich, I ordered the tuna fish w/ cheese which was topped with a bunch of veggie options! The portion of tuna was pretty light as I tasted more veggies than tuna  but it was still good. Had to top it with their magic sauce for the perfect touch.Would definitely come back here again next time I visit Miami!",

      "Grabbed the terminator for a beach day, one of the best sandwiches! Drenched it with the French vinaigrette for each bite",
      "So good, and so necessary, that I couldn't even stop myself and get pics of the sandwich. That's right, one of your Yelp fearless leaders was unable to do the thing that he has done so many times because he was consumed by the need for late night munchies while visiting the Brickell area.Even at the late hour of 1:30am or so, we received fast and patient service as it was our first time to any La Sandwicherie as tourists, and didn't know the deal. I settled on an Italian sandwich on baguette, added fresh mozzarella, and had it fully loaded with all vegetables except olives and cucumbers. When it came out, the bread was warm and delicious as i sunk my teeth into the first bite. The amount of meat and cheese was very solid, and all the veggies made this basically an Italian chef salad on baguette. The oil based sauce was just the kicker that set it over the top.Always take your pictures first, because if you take a bite, at that point you won't be able to stop when the food is this good. Sandwicherie, thanks for saving my late night hunger!",
      "It's not terrible, but was definitely not worth the hype. Ordered 3 different speciality subs and it was about 50$. Miami is obviously expensive, but would have rather paid 25$ for 3 Publix subs less than a mile down the block. I also repeated not toasted several times, all subs came toasted. I also do not understand why the speciality sauce is so good, had no flavor. The service was good, especially because it was so busy.",
      "What a simple concept. Great bread and fresh toppings on the sandwich of your choice. A perfect marriage between French baguette and whatever you decide to put in your sandwich. They have a couple that they recommend, but all are amazing. Amazing smoothie as well. The original location on South Beach is a icon. Open till 5am for that perfect after anything munchies."

      "We ordered The Riccardo pizza and added olives and tomatoes, because we were craving a veggie pizza with more flavor. I do not recommend doing this because it turned out so wet and soggy that it wasn't really edible! It wasn't cooked thoroughly, either. I think it was the overload of diced tomatoes that made it so soggy. It seems like the poured a can of diced tomatoes on the pizza , liquid and all!   Unfortunately, by adding these 2 extra ingredients, there were barely any peppers that we love on it. Some pieces didn't have any spinach, peppers or mushrooms on it. I wish they did a better job of evenly distributing the veggies and cooked it all the way. We did try to cook it more in the toaster oven , but the dough was so wet and soggy , it didn't work. We ended up picking out the good veggies and moving them up towards the crust part of the pizza and just eating that. We cut off the soggy dough and threw it away. This was hard for me because I can't stand wasting food ! ( I grew up having to  eat everything on my plate before I was excused from the table and told that there are people starving, so I should be grateful for the food in Front of me . Ugh the guilt !!! Lol. )    Just annFYI - This isn't the first time that we've received pizza from Mister 01 that was not thoroughly cooked , so if you don't own a toaster oven, I'd order pizza from another restaurant!",
      "Host was a bit confused or confusing.  But all good, got a table with minimal wait.  Server was great but odd at the beginning - took our order and I forgot to order my beverage - would have thought they would want to sell me an adult beverage.  Great salad - big, refreshing, crisp, fresh.  They forgot the ranch dressing and brought it over about the time we were just finishing our saladJust opt'ed for the regular pizzas.  Well made, crisp crust, although could be crisper.  Overall, enjoyable",
      "Love this pizza place. Casual, great atmosphere. The service is great ( our waitress and bus boy were super friendly) but the host not so much.

Truffle ricotta and honey go very well together.Marco - 3.5/5. Really fun getting a tasty white sauce on the side, but the salad style pizza was a tad boring.",
      "What a classy restaurant for a midday lunch, meeting, or just some great brickell people watching. In the heart of brickell Mary village, the corner location is fabulous, with outdoor and indoor seating.The Sabrina salad was great and is a large portion- definitely enough to share. I loved it. My date got a small plain pizza which was the perfect balance and just enough to leave feeling satisfied. Also very tasty. Mister 01 is a reliable pizza chain, I've yet to be disappointed with food at any of the 3 I've been to throughout Miami. Honestly the one star docking is because we got a mouthful of windex or cleaning spray from table being cleaned next to us and the high powered fan and it literally and figuratively left a bad taste in our mouths and definitely hit our food. It was lovely otherwise a",

It looked AMAZING online.  I added pepperoni to it.  I am attaching a photo of what I ordered vs what I received.  To be fair, I received a cold tub of stracchiatella cheese in a bag alongside the cold pizza. Pizza had zero mozzarella on it.  None.  Other pizza ordered also had no cheese.  Imagine a pizza with meat, sauce, and zero cheese.  I don't mean light on the cheese - I mean zero.   This was a very disappointing experience.",

I always try to come to their anual Anniversary event with complimentary Mojitos. So many flavors of mojitos too. I love it. Great way to spend the afternoon and celebrate. Last year they passed out cute wharf bucket hats. I still have mine. Not only is this place fun, they really always try to do something interesting here. And plus food trucks. Yum.

The drinks were so good and they put real sugarcane in it which is not common on the west coast so it was a real treat! They have a bunch of different food carts surrounding the venue, I tried the ceviche and it was pretty good. I love that you have different options and that it's all in one place. The ambiance and atmosphere is amazing if you love liveliness and loud music. There were people on the dance floor but there's also so much space to chill and take photos.

      "I've been coming here for a few years with my friends ,it's been one of our main favorite hang out spots simply because it has a fantastic view ,a variety of  different food options and the music is mainly pop Latin which I'm a big fan of . I definitely recommend to pass by day or night you will have a great Miami experience from the salty air ,the music amazing view and people it's a VIBE . I just now decided to write a review because I'm viewing it in a different perspective to help out locals and tourists . I hope this review is helpful ! There is street parking but there is also a parking lot next to it which is where I mostly park because it's pretty big and if you don't find there then there's valet . At the parking lot you need to do the PayByPhone thing . It's not too expensive . During the day there sometimes events like for example I joined a beagle meet up and it was adorable seeing all the dogs have fun with their owners , all ages were welcome . This place is big and good for groups .it's not as big as their ft lauderdale one though ,that one is HUGE . The Wharf most of the time has events and they decorate accordingly which I think is cute ,gives you lots of photo opportunities . The food is good and there is a variety to choose from so everyone can choose and enjoy . Music is pretty loud if you're sitting or standing by the inside main bar but if you're on the deck or on the outside green area it's not too loud so you get to choose . It really is a great time ! I definitely recommend it as a true Miami'in girl :)",
      "Thanks so much for sharing the awesome pictures, Alejandra! We love hearing (and seeing) what our guests enjoyed! Your review rocks. Thank you!",
      "Very nice venue for partying with friends! After long time in quarantine it was nice to be outside and dancing again =)Prices are good for drinking too.Un lugar muy agradable para salir de fiesta con amigos. Después de mucho tiempo en cuarentena fue agradable estar fuera y bailar de nuevo =)Los precios son buenos para beber también.",
      "Nothing makes us happier than reading about an experience like yours :). Thanks for sharing it with us, Marian! We can’t wait to welcome you back soon!",
      "Great cool place to come out and have a good time with your friends or CO workers or any type of events. They are always having an event With strict specials reflecting that event. Prices tend to be a little bit on the higher side And often with the events and bigger crowds I go there at times it does feel they are understaffed a little bit to take care of the high demand of people that go. Other than that it's a very cool place to go to do they have food trucks on sites that you can order food from great music great drinks and the views are amazing since it's on the river."

      "Great Christmas Eve experience! If you have to be out of town on Christmas Eve for work (we work in the airline industry),  there's nowhere that could possibly make you feel more welcome than Fleming's on Brickell.The food was amazing - those Fleming's potatoes should be put in a potato hall of fame - but it was the service that was most remarkable.From the moment we walked in the door (our entire flight crew of 6), we were greeted warmly and enthusiastically.We couldn't have been luckier than to have Blanca as our server - just the right amount of humor and wit - I'd go back just for her!Everything our crew ordered - Fleming's potatoes, Brussels sprouts, sautéed mushrooms, onion rings, asparagus, filet mignon, salmon, lobster, shrimp diablo - was flawlessly prepared and amazing.As stuffed as we were after dinner, Blanca somehow managed to get us to order desserts - carrot cake, cheesecake, chocolate gooey butter cake, and creme brule - and we wolfed down every bite - they were simply amazing.Thank you Fleming's and Blanca, for making us feel cared for and loved as we  spend the Christmas holiday on the road.",
      "This was a very strong 4. Really a great overall experience. The staff was attentive and friendly. Good interaction and waitress was helpful with the menu. Food. Absolute star. My recent experience at steakhouses has been that the steaks haven't stood out. This was not the case here. I ordered the strip medium rare and it was cooked perfectly. It was a large cut and the salty peppery char was amazing. I've eaten at a lot of steakhouses and this strip was as good as any. I would 100% order this steak again. A few more thoughts on food...Onion rings- Insanely good. Huge chunks that were crispy and the sauce on the side was like a sriracha aioli on steroids. Asparagus- usually bland at most steakhouses these were seasoned well but not overall salted or cooked. Just right. Calamari- this was really good as the added peppers and onions elevated the dish. Would order this and all of the items again. Red Wine- ordered a bottle of Quilt. A Napa Cab on the recommendation of the waitress and it was a perfect pairing with the meal. Enjoyed the experience and would recommend it and go back again.",
      "First off... yesss!!! First time coming to a Flemings restaurant and they didn't miss. When we arrived for our reservation, the kind hostess gave us options for seats which was nice. It wasn't too busy and she was very accommodating. Andy was our server and was a gem. He explained the menu well and even brought a few glasses of brut to celebrate my recent milestone. Very kind! The manager came and checked on us and the rest of the staff was also on point. The location is right in downtown Brickell - right next to my office. I can see this being a popular location for corporate patrons in the area. I'm not sure about parking options but it didn't appear to be many - although there seemed to be a valet option around the corner. Not sure if this is available to Fleming's patrons or not.The food and server were equally stand out. We started with the calamari to share and it came with warm bread and two types of gourmet butters. Delicious! Next we're the steaks, which were cooked to perfection, the Brussel sprouts with bacon, and Mac and cheese. Everything was a winner!I'd recommending this Flemings location to anyone in the Brickell area looking for good food, good service, and an awesome experience.",
      "Third time coming to Fleming's here in Miami and I must say it does not disappoint. Every time we crave steak we end up at Fleming's. The staff and the service is awesome, the ambiance is very Miami and the steaks keep us coming back! Can't wait till we return.",
      "Stopped by Fleming's once again! Another fantastic and enjoyable dinner. We had a glass of wine and this steak for 2 with the Cesar salad, we love to keep it simple. Never disappoints. Thank you Fleming's for an amazing dinner and over the top service.",
      "Let's start off by saying I love Fleming's! I've been to the one in New Jersey and other locations. This was a great experience. Our server was Pedro and he was fantastic, he was kind and went above and beyond in order for us to have the best experience. We started off with the shrimp cocktail which was fresh and delicious. Their bread was warm and the pumpkin spiced butter was out of this world. For the main course we had the New York strip and the Prime Dry-Aged Ribeye which were both cooked to perfection. I can't say this enough I love Fleming's and the ambiance to this location is very hip and fun! can't wait to return and hope you're lucky enough to have Pedro as your server!",
      "Nice, quality place to dine anytime. They have a couple private rooms, so this is a go to when I need to coordinate corporate lunches and dinners. Their service and food are excellent.",
      "In my humble opinion, this is the best chain steak house. I went here after a sporting event, we were seated right away, and the service was incredible. Our server, Julio was world class and made sure we were well taken care of. I had the filet mignon and it was charred on top and tender inside. A perfectly cooked steak. The server was able to suggest a wine that paired perfect with my meal and the mash potatoes I had with the steak was just the right consistency. We sat outside on a busy night and took advantage of the December Miami weather. I shared a creme brûlée with my girlfriend and it was incredible. I should of mentioned before that they make their butter in house. Great restaurant, and I will be back.",
      "This place is simply amazing! The food, ambience and service were impeccable! I treated my daughter for her 10th birthday and we truly enjoyed everything with the exception of the area where they sat us at which is considered the \"lounge area\" not sure why when we had reservations made prior, It didn't feel like we were apart of the main dining area. My server was awesome and attentive. We had the CERTIFIED ANGUS BEEF RIBEYE $55 with JUMBO LUMP CRAB MEAT over the top ($15 extra), a side order of CHIPOTLE CHEDDAR MAC & CHEESE $14 and my daughter had the FILET MIGNON and STEAK FRIES $25 from the children's menu along with the Flemings salad and cheesecake for dessert and it was cooked to perfection, she really enjoyed it. Parking: They have a parking garage along side the restaurant, I paid $10 for approximately 2/3 hours, not bad.",
      "Fleming's was wonderful! We started things off with salads - I ordered the Wedge, smothered in Bleu and other yummy toppings. We then were brought our main courses, various steaks, onion rings, Mac & cheese, Fleming's potatoes, and sautéed mushrooms. Delicious!! Our steaks: Prime Dry-Aged Ribeye and the Prime New York Strip. Our waitress asked if we were celebrating any occasion and after revealing that we were celebrating a birthday, they offered us a dessert of our choosing on the house! The birthday boy picked the Chocolate Gooey Butter Cake for dessert!  yummmmyyyy!I highly recommend getting a reservation, although they did not seem overly busy.  Definitely snag a glass of Catena Malbec  it paired well with the New York Strip.",
      "I'd like to start by saying that this place is amazing! and beautifully decorated as you'd expect from a five star restaurant. Personnel is very friendly and as expected can count of waiter, waitress or in our case bartenders will manage you dining experience to perfection.We didn't have reservations and it being Friday evening there wasn't any available seating so we accepted to sit at the bar. They have a great wine selection and was happy that bartender let us try a couple of different wines before making our selection to a bottle of Belle & Goss Pinot Noir.I ordered the 12 oz. aged deep rubbed ribeye and two sides of Brussels sprouts Flemings potatoes that was very delicious. For dessert we shared the carrot cake and it was amazing. Overall left restaurant happy after an amazing meal. Hope to be back at this place soon.",
      "UPSCALE STEAKHOUSE located in BRICKELL.With Aged prime beef and good seafood.GOOD ATMOSPHERE!. Place is pretty new, nice decorations and big wine selection. They have very innovative cocktails as well.I would say priced accordingly for your typical Miami Steakhouse/ fine dining experience. Highlights:I had the lobster bisque ( on the thicker side, chunks of lobster on the inside, just a bit salty). The CRAB CAKES were Perfect! ( recommend ) The lobster Mac and cheese was also one of my favorites ( creamy and cheesy ). SO SO: Service was ok, but the food took long to arrive and the waiter took long to greet and bring drinks.Steak was good but had a little too much fat for my liking. But it was eatable ( was also cooked perfect ). The lobsters were very small for price... ( taste was ok ) MUST GET:For dessert you can't miss with the creme brûlée. For the most part it was good experience, food was good. Well recommended for any occasion or simply a night out on the town."

      "Seaspice was amazing. It's a fantastic restaurant with a great view right on the Miami River. If you don't right you can catch the live music as the sun sets, and the restaurant transforms to a lounge. Totally worth coming Parking is tricky, and if you're not paying attention you might miss it as you drive by. But it's a gem worth coming back to.",
      "Seaspice is known to Miami locals as a very high end resturant, frequented by celebrities.  I have no idea why.  The service is pretty awful.  The drink runners are horrible.  It takes about 30 minutes for just a drink to be brought out to you.  The food is mediocre.  It is definitely NOT worth the price, which is very expensive.  I am giving two stars because the view is amazing.  Seaspice is right on the water and has a gorgeous ambiance.  You can watch yachts drive by and some will even pull up and park.  The other star is for the tres leches.  This dessert was AMAZING, I would go back just to eat it again.  But otherwise, Seaspice is nothing special.  Save your money.",
      "A place that tries to be high end but fails to deliver.Service ? Mediocre Food ? Below parFirst thing when you check in is they tell you that you have a 2 hr max(tacky)",
      "I read this was one of the best patio dining AND a hot spot for celebrities in Miami, so I had to go check it out on our recent travels to this area...Initially I was worried about our luggage situation, as we had to carry our luggage to the restaurant since this was our last stop in Miami. However, they were very accommodating, and let us store some of our stuff in the closet, and we kept the big luggage with us, near our table.As expected, the patio scene was spectacular...city skyline and seaside views, with plenty of yachts passing by! The place indeed had that chic celebrity vibe...truly FAB! Loved the music overhead as well. Somehow, I expected some snobbiness...but not at all. Service was great!Then the food. OMFG...I've had some amazing foods lately, but this takes the cake. Even the complimentary bread was amazing (and unique)! My husband ordered this Wagyu Burger, and I chose this Ragu Pappardelle ( THE best Ragu Pappardelle I've ever had...EVER. ). Then this Pavola dessert...again, just beyond delish. Truly, this was foods for the celebrities.Honestly, I'm shocked at how low the rating is for this place. I assume that if the service isn't top notch, it would probably piss some folks off. The pricing was on the outlandish side...with even lunch entrees starting at around 40. There was even an appetizer item priced at around 70 bucks! Luckily, like I said, I felt that the foods and the service (and especially the spectacular ambiance) made up for it. There was this big yacht parked right near us, which somewhat blocked some of the views from the left. Still, we got our eyeful of seaside/yachtside views.In any case, this was a great way to end our trip in Miami.",
      "Went here with a group of girlfriends for brunch and everything was delicious, they were super accommodating as well.I had the froze , a cucumber and gin cocktail and 2 grey goose and sodas and all were fantastic.As a table we split the fresh fish and a couple sides and it was delicious. Also love the free bread It is definitely on the pricier side overall tbh but great for a fun \"fancy\" brunch",
      "Came here for Miami spice and although we spent more than we thought we would, we had a good time. Everything was delicious. The kale Caesar had pecans and Granny Smith apple slices, never had a Caesar like this but it was a nice change! The Shrimp Pesto Whole Wheat Spaghetti was my favorite, even though I'm not the biggest fan of pesto. The burger was good too just a little messy from the truffle aioli. The chocolate cremoso and tres leches was very good but I'd go with the cremoso for the cocoa nib crumble, yum! All in all, I think it's overpriced and I probably won't come here again because of that. The cheapest bottle of Chardonnay was $75 and most drinks were $20. I only came here for Miami spice and still spent almost $200.",
      "Given we still have Miami Spice going on until the end of the month we decided to try out the lunch menu @ Seaspice gorgeous location on the Miami River, sitting outdoor is really relaxing, so beautiful to watch the boats go by, really lovely To start we had the Comte' Cheese Soufflé, I have to admit this was a bit disappointing, it really did not have the texture of a real soufflé  but then............ the Shrimp Pesto Whole Wheat Spaghetti and the Pan-Seared Chilean Seabass were really good as dessert, both the Tres Leches and the Chocolate Cremoso were yummy Try it out before Miami Spice ends, you can check out the Miami Spice Menus on miamiandthebeaches.com@seaspicemia",
      "First time for me at Seaspice, it is located on the banks of the Miami River it is a gem that you should not miss. Sit outside in the courtyard enjoy your food and a drinks while watching the boats go by, just beautiful We had the Miami Spice lunch which has a very affordable fix price 3 course menu for $ 28, unfortunately this will end soon, nevertheless, I would defiantly go back again for sureRegarding the Miami Spice menu only one observation, they should have had more than one choice for the Entrees without the extra charge, right now you have 4 choices and 3 of these have extra charge on it, not really fair given that you are promoting the Spice menu, you should have at least two or three choices included in the price and one or two with the extra charge We had had Prince Edward Island Mussels, Grilled, the Grilled Faroe Island Salmon and the Profiteroles and Peaches and Cream. My favorite where the Mussels, the garlic pizza bread they brought for the table was absolutely delicious, the Salmon was good too. I had the Peaches for dessert and it was ok, not really my thing, my friend said the Profiteroles were great, next time I will not opt for the healthy dessert We enjoyed all with a good Albariño wine, our experience was made especially enjoyable by our waiter Fabrizio, he was really great ! Thank you Fabrizio @seaspicemia",
      "Bad first impression. Its not a nice feeling to feel like you have to beg to spend your money at a restaurant. Every year I look forward to Miami Spice. It's a great way to try out various restaurants and a unique spread of menu options. Seaspice was on my radar and happened to be one of the participating restaurants offering the Miami Spice menu. I contacted the restaurant in advance and made a reservation for 3:30p for a party of four. My mom who is from out of town was excited to join us for lunch. I advised the restaurant we were doing the Miami Spice menu. The restaurant made it clear that they charge $50pp for No Shows. At 3:15pm, we arrived for our reservation. The hostess Karin greeted us, and advised us that they were running behind on the reservations and because of this they will not be able to offer the Miami Spice menu. Only the a la-carte menu will be offered. This was a bit upsetting because we drove almost an hour to get there and the restaurant is refusing to offer the Miami Spice promotion. Our natural instinct was to just say forget it we will go somewhere else. I mean, at the end of the day who wants to beg to spend their money? It's absurd. If the restaurant is offering a promotional menu and because to no fault of our own they are running behind why should we be penalized?My Mom looked so bummed out. Because she was so excited to try this place. I decided to walk back in and ask for a Manager. The Manager took 20min to come out. When he finally did come over, he introduced himself as Collin. I explained to him what was going on and it seemed as though he wasn't aware that the hostesses were turning Miami Spice customers away. He decided to make it right and advised Karin to honor the Miami Spice menu. Impressive! Things were turning around. Besides the encounter at the hostess stand, the restaurant is beautiful. It is situated on Miami's waterfront were you can view the million dollar yachts passing by. They also have docks for those interested in docking and dining. You can view the downtown city skyline which I am sure looks amazing at night.The food was excellent. The Miami Spice menu offered a three course lunch for $28. You have the choice of a starter (Kale Salad, Cheese Souffle, or White Gazpacho). A choice of entrees (Seabass, Chicken Breast, Shrimp Pesto Pasta, Wagyu Burger, or Plant Bowl). And a choice of dessert (Tres Leches or Chocolate Cremoso). They also offer the option to add a Glass of wine for and additional $12. I ordered the Comte Cheese Souffle, the Green Circle Farms Chicken Breast, and the Tres Leches. The others in my party ordered the Kale Salad, Gazpacho, and Seabass. For starters, My favorites were the Kale Caesar Salad and Cheese Souffle. The Kale Caesar had a mix of shredded Granny Smith apples, pecans and a creamy Caesar dressing. The cheese Souffle was like a fluffy egg Souffle with a cream parmesan sauce and tomato chutney. Delicious!For entrees, both the Seabass and Chicken breast were amazing. The Chicken breast was tender and juicy, served on top of a creamy polenta and topped with corn, peas, and mushrooms. The seabass was seared nicely to give a nice crunch on the outside, while perfectly flaky and moist on the inside. It was served with stewed garbanzo, Swiss chard, and smoked potato. For desserts, we all had Tres Leches. It was served in a small Mason jar topped with 3 milks, and berries. Perfect way to end the meal. The portions are not large but it is filling. The flavors are fresh and very well balanced. The food presentation was notable. The Watermelon Tequila drink was delightful and refreshing. The froze was also a big hit. The cocktails were presented well and created perfectly. We enjoyed everything. Our waiter, Austin was very friendly. He made great recommendations and was very attentive.An 18% gratuity was added to the tab. There are lots of street parking accessible. In the end, the food was great. Ambience was amazing. The hostesses can use additional customer service training and learn to use better judgment to improve the customers experience. There was no need to escalate the matters to a manager. It could have been handled properly by showing empathy, apologizing, and finding a solution to the problem.",
      "Hi Kim,Thank you for dining with us and leaving a detailed review. It has been forwarded to our management team. Our apologies for the confusion at the door.  Glad to hear Collin accommodated you and your experience was turned around.  We are happy to see your great feedback regarding the food, cocktails, and Austin’s Service.  Hopefully you will join us again in the near future!",
      "This is my second time going to sea spice & I normally love it as the first time. I never leave bad reviews But this second time MY PHONE WAS STOLEN AND SECURITIES DID NOThing about it. Instead we're trying to blame me for the situation. I'm not drunk nor was drunk. I walked in with 2 phone and walked out with 1.We came as my friend USUALLY does and this is how they treated us  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME. I thought it was 5 star so nothing could go wrong. With a security right next to our table my phone STILLL got stolen. It was on the table. And to whoever has the time to steal phones is just sad imagine what else they can steal... I wil ask to review cameras but with the way I was treated when I let them know I lost my phone I doubt they will be helpful but I'll let every platform form of review know that they steal phones here. I know the exact time frame as well so they wouldn't even have to look much at the cameras. Let's see. BTW I BEEN HOME SICK AFTER EATING THESE OYSTERS I COULDNT Even celebrate my baby's birthday w him.",
      "Came here for my birthday dinner with my boyfriend for a 7:15 reservation (we called in advance for an outdoor seat dock side) we waited about ten minutes after our arrival for our table to be ready at the bar, the short wait was definitely worth it. Started with an aperol spritz at the bar then ordered octopus and gazpacho to start. Octopus portion was good but the olive oil tasted burnt since it came out on a sizzling hot cast iron looking skillet (its very easy to overcook octopus, please just bring a regular plate next time.) I also had the whole main lobster. Extremely delicious large portion of perfectly cooked and seasoned lobster, bravo. My boyfriend had the truffle coated Chilean sea bass and he absolutely loved it. Vibe: 5/5 this place definitely is a scene but not overwhelmingly pretentious or obnoxious. Absolutely loved the music as well. Service:3/5 A bit slow, our server was very attentive when we were able to get his attention but we had to always wave him down. Food: 4/5 everything was honestly pretty good (octopus could've had a bit more attention to detail)",
      "Hi Liz,Thank you for celebrating your birthday with us!  We are so happy to hear you had a great experience and enjoyed the food.  Your feedback regarding the octopus has been sent to our chef. We look forward to seeing you again soon!"

Incredible. - Tiramisu OMG - get it. - Tableside Caesar - Very nice server - Ben - Foccacia bread The good: - Meatball App - The wine cellar and steak presentation as you walk in is a nice touch General feedback: - Dimming the lights a bit more would give it some real ambiance and a homier feel  - They JUST opened so cut the staff some slack. I've been on a team opening a restaurant before and it's so hard. They did great! - Good location - easy access with ample parking. A local steakhouse is just what the neighborhood needs - The staff was really sweet and everyone was really working hard all night.",
      "Went here for a birthday dinner. They have a great menu with all sorts of selections.  Our waiter was pushy and rude.  We ordered a NY Strip, Branzino, Pasta Bolonaize, Filet Minan, truffle fries and salad.  The steaks were ordered medium well done.  All the food was good except the steaks.  They kept bringing back the steaks rare and the waiter was angry with nasty comments toward us.  If you go here avoid this guy.  We told the mgr who seemed surprised.",

      "Hello my name is Nick. Of course I'm from New York. I usually don't write reviews specially bad ones we got to this nice restaurant very gorgeous inside. The bread was delicious. I have to say the first course was a pasta dish we split. It had a Bolognese sauce on it it was served hot and good. Little did I know that was the highlight of a dinner. My steak came out first they cut it up which I wasn't crazy about but it was cold. my friends ordered a veal dish a special order. They accommodated them but the dish also was ice cold. The dish presentation was very nice but it being cold was definitely a problem. I must mention the sides to twice cook baked potato was a baked potato not twice cooked. The cream spinach was nice fresh baby spinach sautéed with melted cheese on top. The menu, said cream of spinach. I do wish they would get their act together, and I would even consider trying it again. The Decour is very elegant. It was Christmas Eve. We got there at 6:15 and it wasn't that busy. There was no excuse for the cold food. I must say I was very disappointed. My name is nick hogan.",

      "I first got exposed to this place over at the Citadel and now that they have a brand new storefront located in Wynnewood, I'm so happy for them and happy that I could eat at their new storefront! Upon entering, I was greeted very nicely by Deadra and she was so helpful. Idk about you, but the food always taste better with someone as nice as Deadra making it. The decor is wonderful to look at and I was very relaxed within the store.  As always, the food is absolutely delicious! I always get a little jerk chicken bites, but now I've been exposed to the jerk chicken bowl and I haven't turned back. The only difference is I could to have the coconut rice, which is very well-seasoned, in with what I usually get from the bites. What I do is I get the jerk chicken, with the rice, with the plantain fries. Absolutely wonderful! The sauces are incredibly flavorful and a absolute must to have as a pairing with your meal. I will definitely be coming back and excited to even try more dishes they have served up",
      "This last Saturday my mom and I decided to venture out in Wynwood and visit Manjay. Now being a Caribbean girl myself I was very excited to come here . Tucked away in a hidden center is Manjay . You really need to keep your eyes open or you will pass the restaurant. But once we got there I knew exactly what I wanted to order . I order the Conch Fritters and my mom order the Jerk Chicken bites which came with plantains fries.The Conch  Fritters were well fried , they weren't over cooked and they came with a delicious cilantro sauce on the side . I also tasted the jerk chicken , which was not overly hot which I liked . Now let me tell you about those plantains fries , they were so good . Now can you tell me where else can you get plantain fries ..... exactly no where . It was so good and it was different . The restaurant has inside and outside seating , the decor was very nice . The server was very helpful and he was very informative which I liked , because we asked plenty  of questions.  I will definitely come back because there are a lot more items on the menu I need to try . So if you're in the mood for some Caribbean food go check it out .",
      "I really enjoyed this hidden gem in Wynwood area of Miami. The place is off in the corner, you need to look out for the address or you may assume they are closed. Walk though a mini alley area and voila Manjay is there and time to eat! We ordered the Griyo Bowl and Jerk Chicken. They were both made a little differently than other Haitian food I have tried, but they were great. The Djondjon rice was a little harder. I do like rice a tad softer, but overall it had great flavor. The one aspect I would change it having some less expensive brands of water.",
      "So yum! Spicy and flavorful! The cocktails were good too. Because of allergies, they also kindly substituted my plantains for veggies at no charge. Got the griot bowl",
      "We wanted to eat something different than what we usually do so we decided to get dinner here. I ordered it through yelp just incase they were busy. Its our first time coming here. Its actually hidden inside the other buildings. There was no one there and the decor was pretty. I told the guy I was picking up my order and looked like he had no clue what I was talking about then later realized and just started cooking our food. I sat down while I waited for our food and then later he mentioned that he thought I was doordash or something. The food was SO SPICY I couldnt finish it. We ordered the corn on the cob, jerk chicken bowl, and steak frites. We ordered it in the wynwood location. The corn was still hard like it wasnt fully cooked. I placed order for white rice but once we got to our hotel to eat our food it was not white rice its rice mixed with beans.",
      "Stop by for some authentic and delightful cuisine. Sit, chew, and see the sites! The staff was great and I had a nice time.",
      "You can't see the restaurant from the street. You have to walk down a short corridor to the cafe. It's small with a few tables inside and a few outside. There was only one employee. He was the cook, cashier, bus boy, cleaning crew and host. It's no wonder he accidentally forgot my food order. He was very apologetic for the inconvenience. The food was tasty but I can't say I'd return.",
      "Stopped by on a rainy day while visiting Wynwood. Everything we had was grilled to perfection! So many flavors: tangy, spicy, earthy, etc. and the meat was tender and flavorful. Highly recommend the jerk bites or the griyo. The curry shrimp was also exceptional. We shared plantain chip and jerk bite appetizer which paired super well with the sauces.Overall wonderful experience. Give this place a chance! We plan on visiting their other location at Citadel.",
      "The Griot bowl changed my life! Lol it was soooooo good and great portions. I would've shared a pic but it didn't make it. :)",
      "the food is pure flavor and one of the best Haitian food spots I've had. I love it and hope they grow to a full fledged restaurant because it's too good. the from Ayiti with love is my favorite dish. writing this review is giving me flashbacks and I'll be by this weekend."

      "I ordered for the third time and the food is still great but their getting stingy . Especially with the rice which oddly enough is the cheapest thing . Like we say in Spanish , echa un poco ma ! ( put a little more ) I also like there repollo but it's not an option as a extra side . Will try to find somewhere else but it won't be easy but enough with places being petty.",
      "There's an old saying... don't judge a book by it cover . I think this says it all . I ordered with a little hesitation but man everything has tremendous flavor from the carne asada made to order , the beef soup reminds me of real home cooking . The pork masitas are awesome . The arroz con pollo has great flavor ( the only thing I wish it was a leg quarter not shredded) . I only ordered a few things to try them out but I definitely will order again . I highly recommend , wow !",

      "Is going to the well first I was going to the bank I lost my bank card and this is how we start our journey. As I continued walking I said the first restaurant I seen I'm going to try I have to try it I'm I'm pissed off so the first restaurant I see better be good and thank God I found las Maria's.I can go ahead and first say the atmosphere made me feel young again that it had a smell that took me back to when I was 12 years old and automatically I wanted to stay I didn't want to leave I wanted to stay I wanted to see what else they had to offer.as I looked at the selection there was a particular dish that caught my eye it was salmon and what really caught my eye was the price of the salmon so I decided to go with the salmon rice and beans fried plantains and a poster bone which is a Apple soda. as we sat there they played Aventura on the TV and it just took me back to when I was in high school and there was there was the restaurant across the street that you can just go to and you can just relax and you knew the grandma was in the back cooking I had a feeling an old lady was back there cooking.and as a food arrived presentation I would say was was key nothing to flashes just the food itself however when you first take a bite of the very important the maduros the fried plantains it's it's crunchy not too overcooked and it's not soggy they did it perfect like I said Grandma's in the back I already knew by the tasting of the fried plantains Grandma was in the back. And then as I taste the rice and beans that was you know anybody can make rice in me I'm not going to say was it most exceptional rice and beans that's why I'm giving us a five star I'm giving a five star because of the fried plantains and the salmon was too big pieces of the juiciest the most succulent the herbs were just right it was not overcooked they did it just right.. as I said today that I continue to savor each and every bite I noticed that I was still halfway through with the first piece and I knew for a fact that this plate had won this battle and I needed to go plate cuz I could not finish it off. So if you're ever in Little Havana can I go to area please check out Las Maria's and order the fried salmon you'll never you will not regret it and this has been the foodie ninja and thank you for taking this journey with me",
      "Walked in for lunch today. This has to be the best chicken salad I have ever had! Really cute hole in the wall restaurant run by a beautiful group of sisters! Everything taste amazing and not expensive at all! Menu is fairly priced. Definitely coming back! :)",

      "Randomly decided to try this place with the family and couldn't be more pleased. It appears to be and mom and pop place with abuela cooking in the back. The food was delicious and authentic. It took quite a bit a time to get our food but with a very small staff on hand we were understandable.",

When we arrived, we were greeted with a warm smile and sat at our table. We were acknowledged immediately.Melissa was our server, and was amazing, attentive, and informative. Her menu knowledge and recommendations were on point. You got to try the E.H. Old Fashioned if you like or don't like Old fashioned. That captain crunch brittle is . I'm glad they opened up again and I can't wait for their brunch/lunch to start one day as well. #MissTheCaptainCrunchPancakes Thanks Chef Giorgio and Manny for a great culinary experience.",
      "Eating house 2.0 is an absolute triumph. If you were a fan of the original iteration, you simply must make your way to the new location. The menu does a great job of bringing new items but still paying an homage to the previous tried and true fan favorites.  The ambiance is elevated and so are the food, service and cocktails. The Brussel sprouts were divine as were the straciatella and the Parker rolls but the standout from the starters were the crispy potatoes. The carbonara was a symphony, the chicken two ways a wonderful reinterpretation. If you're a cocktail fan, the counter clockwise swirl was delicious, fresh and perfectly balanced. Dessert is not to be missed, the dirt cup was rich and a perfect ending to the meal.",
      "We have been to Eating House before they left the last time, so we decided to go again. Everything was great, especially our server Jessica. She was patient and knowledgeable about the menu. She was attentive and was always thinking ahead. I would definitely recommend Eating House",
      "Although this is one of the most coveted tables in Miami, we were sat at 8:00 on the dot for our reservation. Our server was glad to recommend and describe dishes to us that my vegetarian boyfriend and I could both enjoy. Note that right now, nothing on the large plates menu is vegetarian, but he did say they'd be able to remove the bacon from the carbonara if we were so inclined. We ended up ordering the Brussels sprouts, which is essentially served as a salad, but using both raw and cooked sprouts. It was different from any Brussels salad I've had and we practically licked the plate. We also ordered the heirloom tomatoes with nuoc cham, peanuts, and frozen coconut milk simply because we were intrigued. It was so fun to eat! Imagine tomatoes and ice cream. Finally, we shared the halibut (he dabbles in fish), which is the most unique preparation I've ever had. It's served with sunchokes, a first for me, and vanilla bean au poivre. The sweetness and saltiness definitely worked, but my only complaint is the dish was on the saltier side. For dessert, we loved the dirt cup -- an elevated twist on a nostalgic classic (I do miss the gummy worms though).",
      "Chef Giorgio Rapicavoli does it again. The new Eating House is the perfect demonstration of chef's evolution and maturity since he opened the first Eating House to roaring success more than ten years ago. The menu is full of his new interpretation of classic EH dishes. The new carbonara made with perfectly cooked cavateli in a truffled carbonara sauce topped with charcoaled bread crumbs is the best example of how he has taken what once was a playfully delicious dish at the old EH and turned in into a complex orchestration of texture, tastes and show. The Brussels sprouts ceasar salad is probably the only way I'll eat Brussels sprouts, simply delicious crunchiness through and through. The menu is small but still full of amazing choices to keep coming back for. We also enjoyed the bresaola carpaccio, and the crispy potatoes w Gouda and caramelized-onions were stellar -- firm on the outside, mashed potato texture on the inside -- leaning into a delicious onion soup experience. The EH Mess dessert was off the charts and the Dirt Cup is back, matured into a heavenly hazelnut version that will make you want to lick the plate. The greatest demonstration of how this EH is so much better is the amazing wine list that chef has curated with top notch selections among a range of appellations and varietals. I can't wait to go back to try more of everything!",
      "Amazing service!! I sat at the bar with a friend and all the staff was so friendly and helpful. Everyone made sure we got ordered depending on our pallet. I will definitely be coming back and recommending this place to everyone i know",
      "As amazing as the original. Great service and ambiance. Went on a Wednesday and it was buzzing, great food and drinks. We ordered:Bone marrow BrusselsPotatoesParker house rollsChicken CarbonaraDirt cupBeignets Everything delicious!",
      "Solid service, great food and cool experience.  We walked in expecting the old earring house.  Pleased to see liquor available, but also found a new menu with much higher pricing.  The food was delicious, Brussels sprouts, potatoes, carbonara, all amazing.  My wife wanted scallops , they were done perfect just not my favorite and was the most expensive thing we ordered.  Decent drink, but also full Miami price.  Not the old hole in the wall with amazing food, now a more elegant venue, higher prices, but definitely worth the premium.",
      "So impressed with the new Eating House vision, food, and service. From the minute you walk into the restaurant your are greeted by kind staff that consistently go above and beyond. The decor and ambiance was carefully and successfully curated. Finally, the food . . . truly incredible. We had the yellowfin tuna crudo, the crispy potatoes, the brussels sprouts, the roasted bone marrow, and the cavatelli carbonara and wow. No complaints. Everything was perfect. I cannot recommend this great restaurant enough."

Once you walk in and you will want to order your tacos at the register and a runner will drops off your tacos at your table of choiceAll there tacos a meaty and delicious !! My personal favorite was the Conchinita and the Barbacoa, seriously the BEST ones I've ever had !! Juicy and tender!",
      "DELICIOUS. JUST GO THERE. SO GOOD!Food was great. Service was good. Definitely will come back!",
      "The good: the totopos are amazing, the shrimp tacos were my favorite tacos! Ordered from Uber eats and they even packaged all items separately to avoid having them arrive soggy, I can definitely appreciate that but I'm also lazy and don't like to build my own taco haha. The bad: nothing bad to say about this place, I wasn't crazy about the plant based chorizo taco but it wasn't \"bad\"Try them out you won't regret it!",

Tortilla is vegan based and a neat touch. The vegetables were fresh and the service excellent. Very beautiful presentation. Cons: the meat was a little dry. I was disappointed in the overall quality of the meat preparation but it may have been a bad batchOverall, decent place for lunch if you are a vegetarian or want some fresh organic vegetables. The meat was a bit of a disappointment.",

Habiscus sangria was tasty. Nice margarita with spicy rim. Order at counter and served at table. Fast and fresh. Will be going back in next few days.",
      "Came for tacos but fell in love with the chips! My friend raved about this place and said we have to check it out. Came for lunch, no need for a reservation, walk in and order or you can order from the QR code on the table. I ordered the mahi taco and Al pastor. Mahi taco was delicious! The crispy-ness and slaw went perfectly together. The Al pastor was good, but I'm salty I paid extra for extra pineapples and literally it was two tiny pieces of pineapple. The totopos though are where it's at! Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, idk how. Then salt sprinkled on the top, Ooof! Wish all chips were like this. Definitely recommend you getting them!!"

Both the FDA and CDC were used to perfection during the situation, and in the end me and my family were able to enjoy our stay at the pool, while also eating great food. Me and my family had an amazing time at the pool, and the service at Blue Water Cafe was a big part of the reason why, so I would highly recommended to check it out when you are visiting the pool.",

They have a nice small plates menu at a reasonable prices, they even have a (good) size Churrasco for $14 and 3 different salads to which you can add chicken or Mahi-Mahi! Their Mojitos are really good and the services of Juan Carlos is on point, either suggesting what to eat, what to drink taking pictures, you name it, he's is always available with a smile!I have 2 suggestions, the first one is the super loud music they play on Friday nights, they called it \"Salsa Night\" and it totally destroy the tranquility, nice view and romantic gateway of guests. They should play Jazz or nothing at all. The other suggestion will be to open for breakfast, with that unparalleled view, I cannot imagine myself having an early breakfast there!",

But not only was the food amazing, but the views were breathtaking. Very small, long (than wide) restaurant with beautiful views. Such a romantic and intimate place to eat for sure (if that's what you're looking for). I'd definitely come back here that's for sure! Glad I got the opportunity to eat here with wonderful human athletes",

Yes, I know Ketel One is an upsell that's why I like it (top shelf). Vodka and cranberry juice taste like water. Ordered the Turkey Cuban, will see what that taste like but the interaction sitting down has already messed up the experience. Basic sandwich with processed meat. So that's that.",
      "It was about 2:30 pm on a Monday, obviously during a slow time and shift change. I sat outside at the bar and it was VERY windy. I wouldn't sit outside next time unless the wind was more tame. It seems like a great place to relax and have snacks by the pool. I had a three cheese panini with a side Caesar salad. The panini was just what I needed. There wasn't too much bread and it was easy to bite through without leaving a lot of crumbs all over the place. It was super cheesy and the pesto was nice. It could have been melted just a bit more, though. The salad was covered in a creamy Caesar dressing. I liked it that way, but if you prefer a lighter dressing you should let them know.The service was friendly. I would definitely visit again.",

The Blue Water Cafe is located by the rooftop pool. Entrance is thru the spa. It was a picturesque evening. The weather was perfect, the music was awesome, and the food & drinks were gr8. What a way to start a vacation. We had a wonderful server, Xavier, who was friendly, helpful & fun! Wish we were down here again since it's Friday night! Highly recommend the Inter Continental Hotel & their amenities.",
      "Most expensive food on the menu is $18 which is make your own pizza. So fairly inexpensive and you get the view of the Biscayne Bay and pool. Great place there are tables just outside which is good if you want to smoke.",
      "For a city on the water Miami has relatively few restaurants with Bay views. Blue Water is an exception and they boast sensational views from this small restaurant on the pool deck of the Intercontinental Hotel. The food is quite good and not exorbitantly priced as many Miami Hotel restaurants are. It's quite casual, service is always friendly (shout out to Clint, one of the friendliest servers in this city.). The menu is limited which is the only reason to give it four and not five stars. But you'll still be able to find something appealing. They also have a very good happy hour but be sure to specify that you are asking for the happy hour drinks, a friend of mine went for $5 wine but didn't specify and he received a surprise on his bill for I think $15 (manager kindly adjusted due to the misunderstanding.) Also note that service fee has been added to the bill already which I certainly hope actually lands in the pockets of the servers. So for good casual fare and fabulous views, Blue Water would be a good choice."

      "Love the chicken and pineapple . Everting is good. Come here two days in a row. Steak is good too",
      "Yambo has been a family favorite since that afternoon when I first stumbled on it. You have to see the yard - horses, roosters, Ruben Dario. It's great. Our lunch the other day was subpar - and ... they no longer have prices on the menu; surely a sign of inflation, but does that mean the prices can easily change?  My husband adventured and ordered baho - steamed beef with yucca, boiled plantains, under a cover of coleslaw. It was ok, the plantains left something to be desire. I had the usual pollo asado. I was informed this was only pechuga (breast); I'm ok with that. I had two pounded slabs of what seemed to be grilled chicken breast with a huge (delicious) serving of gallo pinto and a side of boiled yucca - I should have said frito; the boiled also leaved much to be desired.The biggest problem ... Yambo now gives you flimsy plastic cutlery. I could not cut the chicken, nor the tough yucca. The waitress was busy behind the counter fixing her make-up and hair and did not pay attention to us.Yes, I'll have lunch another day when I can cut the food, but this was not what we  had come to expect.Oh, Yambo is ready for Christmas, too - the decorations are really cute.",
      "For an amazing experience get out of your comfort zone and try Yambo.  Wow, they have a new printed menu and ... prices have stayed pretty much the same.  They have an outdoor cafeteria with loads of choices (I've never eaten there).  Inside is a nice sitdown restaurant decorated with the most kitchy Central American stuff - an eyeful.  We did not have it this time, but a neighboring table did - the huge appetizer plate feeds an army.  I had the roast chicken with a huge portion of rice and beans.  My husband thoroughly enjoyed the nacatamale.  Great place.",
      "I've been coming to this place for years pero years!!! Hands down, great Central American food! The place is inviting because of all the colors and signs outside. And when you walk through the outside seating area you see nothing but Central American art work and other art pieces nailed on the walls and ceilings and floors. There is a sitting area inside and just as decorated, but honestly, the vibe is to order outside and sit outside. The foods, omg, where do I begin?! Carne asada and lengua are always my top choices with queso frito and of course their homemade chili smothered on everything! This is, IMO, a very important restaurant in the city for many Central Americans and one that I enjoy each time I go. Adding some pics of the outside.",
      "Stopped here  for lunch during a week day . The place was pretty much empty. They do not have lunch specials. I was surprised the menú does not have the prices .  The  food was ok, nothing special but it tastes good. Plenty of sides included and generous portions on general. The Gallo pinto far away from the good one and the yuca frita was kind of weird. Bathroom were clean but definitely need a deep cleaning. Service? Oh yea, they had a person who took my order and brought the food and the check.  Next time I would  rather try other small places in the area for lunch instead .",
      "I used to come to this restaurant for good latin food when my husband was working in Little Havana. I haven't been back since then. So, we decided to stop by again.They have hot cooked meals, and you can order and eat there outside. If you prefer a full service restaurant, you can go inside and sit down. I like sitting outside looking at their kitsch decor. There were many choices. I asked the lady at the counter what her suggestion was. She said that carne asada was good. Yes, she was right!I ordered carne asada with rice and beans, and yuca. The dish came with one fried cheese. It was plenty to eat with my husband. The steak was so flavorful and tasty. They gave us two big pieces.And we paid only $13 for a full plate. What a deal! I wish I live closer to this place!",
      "The food was great and the environment was awesomeI really enjoyed the food, fresh and delicious",
      "Three because I still have hope that I just caught them on a bad day. The gallo pinto was DRY. Two pieces of meat now and one was mostly fat and pellejo. The salad had a really funky taste. They've started to cheap out as well with the juices and the cacao, it shows. Not sure that I won't be back but it might be a while.",
      "I remember the night I first wondrously stumbled across Yambo.  Now I probably don't quite remember the details of what exactly happened that night, because I'm sure it was lost in a cloud of rum 'n cokes, cigarettes, and whatever happens in the bathrooms at Space.  But suddenly, staring into the abyss through the window of my Uber ride, there it was... Yambo. Brightly lit on the dark streets of Little Havana, Yambo stands outs like an Oasis in the Sahara desert.  I knew this was no ordinary restaurant. This is a place where something magical happens. This is a place that carries the very soul of Little Havana. What was this place that has a line at 3AM? With the bass still thumping in my cranium from the nights activities, it was settled, I had to find out. \"Yo Uber, drop me off right here\" Suddenly, I'm staring into a window pathetically trying to speak spanish. It all happened so fast and I'm frantically trying to figure out what everything is, but I want to try everything. Is that a pancake? Or a Pastry? Is this a meat or a vegetable? Well there's only one way to find out, so I order everything on the menu. Every item on the menu is as though it was carefully crafted by experts in Nicaraguan cuisine.  Masters of their craft, they deliver a breath taking experience unlike any other fritanga. Every bite is a tantalizing affair, alluring in complete fulfillment, but always left wanting more. Don't come here on a diet, no actually, do come here on a diet, as this is the perfect way to forget that calories are an actual thing. It's like every item is infuzed in butter, seeping through every pore and releases with every bite.  After finishing my meal, and usually having plenty to take home, I release a few notches on my belt and get up to leave. Suddenly I felt sorry for the midtownies and brickellistas.. Imaging spending all of your time east of the 95? So if this is you, and your curiously wondering what happens over here on the mean streets of Little Havana, bookmark this location into your Google Maps. The next time you find yourself out late with good friends having had one too many gin 'n tonics, your inebriated self with thank you immensely.",
      "This place is one of my favorite local eats in miami! They are open 24/7 and the food is on point. I love their carne asada, it is my go to every time I come here. They also have a verity of different juices to choose from and they have a cocoa milk drink. It is my favorite drink. They also offer dessert if you have a sweet tooth. I love this place and they also deliver all night and day.",
      "Food is ok if you walk in to eat.Don't Uber eat, or delivery. They will intentionally send the worst meat with all the fat and burnt rice it's happened a couple times already.Awful service"

Ambiance reminds me of old Miama.   Service was laid back and friendly.   Definitely will return- maybe try there bar that is in the back but not open during lunch.  All in all a great place to try which is located in Hialeah.   Lastly love that they show Seinfeld on the bar tv.  Fits the ambiance perfectly.",
      "Stephens has a great reputation for having a lot of history in Hialeah, with delicious diner food. Even though Kush has definitely infused a lot of their style into the place, it's still cool to see all the articles hanging up with the older decor while still bringing \"new Hialeah\" style. You'll definitely find humor in the Walter Mercado women's bathroom. Also thought it was a cute touch to use older DVD cases as receipt holders. My go to diner staple is a Reuben and this had to be one of the best ones I've tried. Plus, I don't think you can find pastrami croquetas anywhere else in the US. It's really delicious food with good service & decor. With flamingo plaza next door plus Unbranded Brewing right behind, I'll definitely be back!",
      "5 star food, 5 star service, 5 star ambience  Unique updates on old classics served up with funny competent service in a Hialeah classic diner/deli.  Kush Hospitality Group specializes in acquiring and reinvigorating / reinventing south Florida classics, and they knock it out of the park with this one.5 star food:  My sandwich was called a Jewban, sort of the love child of a Reuben sandwich and a Cubano sandwich (I think it was corned beef, ham, pickles, Thousand Island dressing).  The side was yucca fries.  It sounds like there's a possibility of a food train wreck but both were unbelievably good and perfectly made.5 star service:  I knew it was going to be fun when I started out with \"can I have...\" and the waiter cut me off and said \"NO!  haha just kidding\" hehe.  It was pretty clear the regulars loved the staff too...people were trading tips on horror movies and car repair (me among them: I take my car to a place 5 blocks away).  They even brought the check not in one of those little faux leather Amex folders, but in a Star Wars DVD jacket.5 star ambience:  The Kush folks took a Hialeah institution, Stephens Deli, and transformed it into Kush by Stephens, a modern amalgam of all that makes Miami a pretty incredible mosaic / melting pot of food/culture.   The decor inside preserves most of the old with some very funny updates (Hialeah Spiderman pop art in the mensroom, etc)It's in a new-ish area dubbed Leah Arts District but surrounded by residential and a whole bunch of warehouses and body shops.  Parking is pretty easy and abundant (especially if you've taken your car in for service : )",
      "Where do I start!?This place is amazing. Joseph was our server, and man I can't give him anymore praise. Between his hospitality, and helpfulness, he's the reason alone I'd come back. Make sure you request him. The food part is just an added bonus honestly. I had the Jewban sandwich and it was PHENOMENAL. I don't even like pickles and with his convincing, I kept it on and so glad I did. Take his word. My fiancé had the Rachel and I wanted to take hers instead! I highly recommend this place. And with the vibes and atmosphere alone, it gives you more reason to return. 10/10. Definitely returning and trying more.",
      "Absolutely amazing. The inside is super cute. I love the decorations. But I want to hurry up and talk about our waiter Joseph. We asked for his recommendations and he did NOT disappoint. The food is incredible. You cannot compare to the taste of the Rachel & Jewban sandwiches. He also recommended good drinks and didn't judge for it being 11am lol. Joseph was also behind the bar, just an all around guy. Amazing attitude! Will come back for sure! Also TRY the coconut creme ale, SUPER REFRESHING!",
      "Interesante lugar que uno no se imagina. El WOW de la experiencia es la visita al baño, así que vayan a visitarlo aunque no tengan ganas.Pedimos unas croquetas para picar (la de jamón tenía cebolla, no la pude comer). El sandwich de tuna estaba sabroso.",
      "I've been to this location several times and have never been disappointed. From the amazing service and knowledgeable staff to the fresh food, dining here is always a 10/10.For staters, we ordered the nachos and wow I've never had anything like it. Highly recommend. As my main, I had the Rachel and opted for a leaner cut for just $1 more and my boyfriend had the Reuben. Both sandwiches were amazing! The bread was nice and toasty and the meat had an incredibly juicy flavor.",
      "Such a joy to have Kush bring back a hialeah legend ! Stephens has been a hialeah staple for ages, serving up classic New York style deli sandwiches and being great at it! Kush came and left all the hood of Stephens while elevating it with the Kush touch! Great sandwiches, great appetizer options, good beer selection, and cocktail options. The decor is excellent as all places Kush are, and wait til you go to the restrooms... you'll be in for a treat (the most Miami restrooms ever .... Err hialeah restrooms  ) Well head on over and enjoy Stephens ! Don't forget to check out the speakeasy  cranking out some cool cocktails next door, la cocina !",
      "Great traditional New York style deli in Hialeah! The sandwiches we had had were great and displayed high quality cold cuts and bold flavors. Nice to also have chicken and waffles at a Hialeah spot! The ambiance is a throwback and makes you feel like you may have even left Hialeah for a bit. The bathrooms and the decor on the hallways are incredible and fun to look at as they share them with the cocktail bar \"la cocina\". Glad to have this in Hialeah ! Thanks to kush hospitality for reviving this legendary spot and also bringing some more flair to the Hialeah food scene.",
      "Amazing!  The pastrami sandwich was delicious. The frita burger was great. I recommend the yucca fries with their sauce- delicious. The yucca fries were fresh and seasoned spectacularly. Service was great. Cool decor. I come often and am never disappointed."

      "Such a great gem in the Brickell area and I highly suggest you add this to your foodie list. I attended a holiday party here and because the menu was family style, I had a chance to try sooo many good things. To start we had snapper tartare, a fresh and chopped mixed salad, and a shiitake mushroom flatbread. Typically I stay clear from anything tartare but I am pleased to announce that I finally found a tartare that I like. The fish was so tender and it melted it my mouth so this was definitely my favorite app of the night. For the main course, we had the choices of gnocchi and blue crab, NY strip steak, and mushroom crusted grouper. I tried everything and they were all delicious but the gnocchi had me in a chokehold. It was amazing!! I was full but had to keep eating lol. After everything settled and awards were given, they brought out the dessert and they were both fire! The coconut cake with rum sauce was delicious and the taste in the sauce as subtle but complimented the moist cake well. It wasn't overly sweet or dry like some cakes can be. The sticky toffee pudding is a dream! It was served warm and with ice cream so I only tried a little due to my dairy sensitivity. I would come back here in a heartbeat and I absolutely love that they offer a daily happy hour from 4-7. See you there?",
      "As one of my \"go- to\" restaurants in Brickell. River oyster bar has been a staple in community.  Fresh and tasty food, great ambiance and service, this oyster bar has it all. Below are a few of my recommendations although when I say you can't go wrong here, I stand by that!- Blue Crab gnocchi - asian style snapper- crab cake- Yuka Fries- Brussel Sprouts- Duck Taco(if available)",
      "The food was so-so, the service was alright. Our entrees were a bit bland or have flavors that did not really jive together. Our waitress did a decent job but nothing outstanding. The kitchen runner had a bit of an attitude during our two encounter meant. Overall I will not be coming back to this place and can not recommend it to others either.",
      "Thank you Daniel for sharing your review. We are so sorry to hear you did not enjoy our entrees.",
      "Stopped by after shopping at brickell city center. It was the perfect time for happy hour, that lasts until 7. I ordered the oysters and lamb kabob with a glass of Prosecco. The oysters were fresh and delicious. The kabobs were so tasty. It was packed for a Wednesday night, and the people were so nice. A lot of the people work in the area that come to the bar. Highly recommend if you are in the area.",
      "The grilled octopus was so delicious! Ordered 3 rounds of each oysters and they liked most of them. The baked oyster was ok, kind of dry from the chorizo. My group and I sat in the \"private room\" which was underwhelming. The front of the restaurant and bar area is the spot to sit if you ever go there.",
      "My friend and I visited this place for the first time we visited Miami and hands down.The food was amazing (I truly recommended the pot of mussels if you are into the fresh mussels that are cooked in delicious spicy (medium spicy - not too bad) broth).The server was a gentleman and was very attentive.",
      "I had to update my review to 5 stars. This restaurant is truly amazingly good. We went twice in a week. This time we ordered 4 meals for three of us and shared them Family style. We asked Sarah, our server, what she thought were the best plates and that's what we got! ONG!! Everything was delicious. We tried the gnocchi with crab, the squid ink pasta, the scallops and the mushroom crusted fish. We also had some great oysters and a bread basket. No room for dessert!",
      "I have to say this is one of the best seafood rest in Miami!  The restaurant is beautiful inside, incredible decoration, the pictures of Stiltsville are spectacular and so are the fish on the wall. The service was on point from the moment we walked in. Our server was great and so personable. We had oysters and goat cheese croquettes to start. The oysters were really fresh. We were there for lunch so we wanted a small meal. We shared a whole grilled snapper and a side. A perfect portion. The fish was so fresh and perfectly grilled. Not dry at all. We tried a dessert served in a mug, like a crème brûlée, very refreshing and a perfect sweetness. We left extremely happy and will be back very soon!!",
      "This place is awesome!!! Came here for happy hour on a weekend and it did not disappoint. Specific oysters are half off along with well drinks, la Rubia beer and some select wines. Started off the evening with some west coast oysters which were very delicious and super fresh. You can even see some guys in the back shucking them before they arrive on the place. Then ordered the deviled eggs with caviar and kebabs to finish off apps. Ordered the snapper curry which was super delicious with the bok Choy and sticky rice. Super flavorful and not overly creamy. Also got the gnocchi blue crab which was 1/2 highlights of the night. Gnocchi was super delicious and the crab was super fresh. Definitely a must try when you're here.2/2 highlight was the coconut cake. I'm not one for soft cakes, but this cake was probably one of the most moist cakes I've ever tasted. So delicious and not overwhelmingly sweet! A MUST TRY AS WELL!! Thank you river oyster. You've outdone yourself",
      "Had a pleasant experience sitting at the bar during happy hour on a Wednesday. I was a party of 1 so the bartender did a great job recommending smaller dishes so I could try a few different things off the menu vs. ordering 1 large entree. The oysters are fresh, and they do have some of them on the happy hour menu too- very tasty! I also tried the snapper tartare, which was pretty good for an appetizer to split with a few different folks. The sauce the snapper was in was a bit too tangy for my liking, as a party of 1. The fried cauliflower was delicious- will look to order a fish entree on my next visit, paired with a side of that cauliflower. Highlight of the meal, they have the ingredients to make a Vesper martini- and the bartender knew what it was! (Look it up, its very tasty!)",
      "Recently had one of the BEST dinners in recent memory! Arrived at prime time on a Friday night (7 pm). Restaurant was packed, yet was sat promptly by Stephanie, the friendly Hostess. Herman, our bilingual server, was quick to greet us, and bring cocktails. First course, snapper tartar, Hamachi sashimi&, grilled octopus, all amazing! Next, Blue crab gnocchi, sweet and spicy salmon on fried rice & grilled scallops. All seafood was SO Fresh! Please do not miss this experience! Truly awesome!!",
      "Thank you so much Rose for your beautiful review! We are happy to hear you enjoyed dinner with us!"

      "Even if you are a carnivore, you have got to check this out - I promise, you won't miss the meat! I have been to this event several times and I have never been disappointed.  I try to go as often as I can, as every dinner is a brand new experience that leaves your pallet wanting more! Chef Allen comes up with so many creative ways to serve these delicious vegetables that are locally grown, that I have yet to experience the same dish twice.Dinner is served outside, family style, surrounded by all of the vendors that are there for the Farmers Market.  Chef Allen himself comes out and introduces himself, the theme of the night, and each dish. He is incredibly personable and it adds a whole other layer to this already wonderful experience. The service is fantastic.  The servers make sure that your wine glass is never empty, and Keith Green, the general manager of Books & Books, is outstanding.  Upon checking in with him, he asks you if you will be drinking red or white and out comes the first pour! I HIGHLY recommend springing for the wine option as it is worth every penny and the wines that Kieth selects are awesome. This event takes place every Monday night at the Books & Books at the Arsht Center and once a month at the Books & Books in Coral Gables.  I have been to both and they are great.  At the Arsht Center, the parking is free for this event and that is a HUGE plus. I highly recommend you check this out.  It is a lovely experience where you enjoy healthy, fresh food with new friends, under the stars, with wine and excellent service! I have dragged many friends with me to this event and every single one of them has come back for more!",
      "I Really enjoyed the 5 course dinner. Staff and chef are very friendly. It feels very welcoming and easy. The plates were exactly as in the name, farm to table.Tables are set up next to the farmers market.I opted for a glass of rose and it was really good (and I'm not a wine drinker).The plates came out at a good pace.Everything was really good and tasty. I tasted some new things (e.g. fennel, roasted olives...). I wouldn't mind eating here again, but it was not mind blowing either. It's outside dining so if there's no breeze then it must be very hot sitting there.if you love the better things in life and are a vegetarian then this is definitely the spot for you! It is very different for Miami! I'm sure there's nothing like this around.",
      "I'm an unrepentant meat eater. I love cows on a plate, on bun (along with chicken), etc etc. However,  I'm open minded enough that I'll try a vegetarian meal once in a while, especially if it's with fellow foodie friends.Josette S. posted the event, and this was my second time at Chef Allen's Farm to Table dinners, since I'd previously indulged at an Elite event a few years back. There is still free parking across the street. The dining area had various farmer market booths around selling vegetables, jams and a tasty cherry Italian ice.To a carnivore like me, salads are typically just the app or first course, but as a vegetarian meal everything was a salad. We started with a family-style plate of various (yellow, red, and roma) tomatoes and fried okra. I found out veggie dishes can be fried! The third course of roasted potatoes and red peppers along with a cool yet spicy red pepper hummus. This contained my usual veggie plates so it was easily my favorite! Main course was a piece of eggplant parmesan with just the right amount of tomato, cheese and a side of wild rice. I ate most of the eggplant \"meat\" but left the skin.The second course, other than the shredded carrots,  was the one I could have passed on.  Like President Bush, Broccoli wouldn't be prudent,  not gonna do it..Dessert was a rich, not overly sweet,  piece of chocolate brownie. Though I said in was going to be a troll and have a burger afterward,  I was actually satisfied! Chef Allen himself spoke the first event I went (during the elite event) giving a history of how each dish related to the dinners theme. However,  he wasn't there at Monday's event so we missed out on that.  Still, the manager and staff from the Books and Books cafe were very pleasant and informative. I'd definitely give the cows another break sometime.",
      "I was first introduced to this delicious experience thanks to a CMYE. After that, I just have been hooked. I decided to put together a little dinner party experience of 15 family members and friends so they too could experience the vegetarian delight that is Chef Allen's Farm to Table Dinner.It was rather a warm day at first, but once the sun started setting it set for the perfect environment. Chef Allen came out to greet us and open up the night with an introduction to the family style evening's theme, which was Guatemala.  After that, we were served the first course of 5 for the night. We were served a tostada with refried beans, queso fresco, and a limeRadish salsa. It was a perfect way to start the meal. After that we were served tostones topped with an avocado slaw which was amazing! I honestly could have had the whole plate. It was delicious! Now onto the corn lollipops! I currently have braces, but that wasn't going to stop me! I carved off those amazing kernels and was able to savor them bite by bite, seasoned with crispy tortilla flakes and spice rub that was perfect! For the main entree we were served portobello taquitos, served with yellow rice and drizzled with a tomatillo sauce that was delicious! Between the tostone and the taquitos I was hooked! Finally for dessert, they severe a green apple empanada either a scoop of vanilla ice cream. At this point I was stuffed, but it was really good. Overall it was perfect evening of food, wine and great company. The staff was amazing. A special shout out to Keith who accommodated us as a large group. Oh and a tip for the wine drinkers get the drink package, you won't regret it.",
      "Amazing time, amazing food and amazing ambience. Chef Allen creates wonderful vegetarian dishes and explains each item. This is family style dining,  so prepare to make new friends. Loved it! Will definitely come back.",
      "I've been to Chef Allen's Farm to Table a few times now, and it is by far one of my favorite dining experiences in Miami. Chef Allen Susser brings a family style farm to table meal to a small group every Monday night at Books and Books outside of the Arsht Center. It's a great way to get to know people, and really brings a sense of community to a city that sometimes feels so disconnected. The food is always creative and tasty. You won't miss the meat, I swear! I can't wait to go to another one soon.",
      "A five course dinner that is healthy, vegetarian, delicious, and totally fulfilling? Prepared by a celebrity chef using fresh local ingredients? In a lovely outdoors setting where you can chat with your friends or share the family style dishes with some new friends at the communal table?  All this for $25? Unbelievable!  Parking is free across the street in the lot, and usually there are a few stalls at the tiny farmers market held the same evening.  I recommend calling ahead to reserve your table, and you pay up front as you arrive.  I went with a group of Yelpers as a UYE, and became an instant fan.  Try it yourself, I'd bet you won't miss your meat!",
      "What a FANTASTIC experience! I had been hearing about Chef Allen's Farm to Table dinners for over a year & always planned to attend. I finally did last night & it was incredible. The dinners are held Monday evenings at the Book & Books in the Arsht Center & once a month at the Books & Books in the Gables & you can elect to have the wine pairing for a bit more. Free parking directly across the street in Downtown is a HUGE plus! We arrived and were immediately surprised by a farmer's market being held and long family style tables set up in between. It was a perfect Miami evening with cool breezes blowing in from Biscayne Bay & the Downtown skyline behind us. As soon as we were seated, Chef Allen came up & began by discussing the theme of the dinner (Spring!) & where they source their local produce. The meal itself is vegetarian but not vegan & he mentions to let him know of any allergies. Once he finished his welcome speech to excited applause, the food began to appear. The sun was beginning to set over Miami when the first of 5 courses was sent out... the Moroccan Spiced Carrots were divine! Next came Sweet Potatoes with Sweet & Spicy Green Beans, followed by the beautiful Heirloom Tomatoes; Amazing colors & presentation! ALL beautiful to look at & delicious to eat. Throughout the evening, Chef Allen continued to walk around & engage with all the diners table-side offering information on the dishes & answering any questions. The first 3 dishes were served family style & we were lucky enough to be seated next to a lovely couple, Diane & Ken, who had attended many of these dinners in the past & were able to give us lots of extra insights. For the main course, we were served a beautiful Spring Vegetable Tart which was again, delicious & perfectly cooked puffed pastry. For dessert, we had a wonderful Chocolate Creme Pie with a Salted Caramel Sauce to finish up an incredible meal. The entire experience was SO wonderful & I truly cannot wait to return VERY soon to see what else Chef Allen has whipped up!",
      "Great clean and healthy alternative for a monday night. The menu changes weekly depending on the theme the chef comes up with and is a nice change of pace. The seating is done outside the Arsht Center , next to the farmer's market. On this date, there was a spanish guitar player with some nice tunes. The weather is great this time of year, so it wasn't bad for seating outside. The menu is strictly vegetarian and it includes a 5 course meal served family style, adding $14 if you want to pair it with wine. Overall, it was a nice experience , something out of the ordinary.",
      "This is a spectacular treat! Chef Allen, famous from his former namesake restaurant in Aventura, now does monthly outdoor Farm to Table vegetarian dinners at 6:30pm on the first Monday of each month. His ingenuity and skill shines through and this is a special experience to those interested in fine vegetarian cuisine."

      "So, I discovered Doggi's  back in 2016 because I was craving some food from the motherland and it has since been the absolute best Venezuelan restaurant I have ever been to. After 6 years, I thought it was time to give them a 5 star review once and for all. To start off, I have to stress the fact that this specific location is the best one -- Doggi's has around 5(?) locations scattered around south Florida now but this one always has the full menu and the best chef. Everything is made fresh so there is a bit of a wait, but it's 100% worth it. I personally recommend the arepa pabellon because it's the best way to get a taste of Venezuela (Pabellon is a traditional Venezuelan dish) and is packed full of flavor -- it comes with shredded beef, plantains, cheese, and black beans. I also highly recommend the tequeños -- make sure you try them with the Guasacaca sauce -- it's the green, garlic+cilantro based one.Another thing I love about Doggi's is that they have a bunch of Venezuelan slang scattered around the walls and tables, so if you're looking to learn some  Venezuelan vocab, just take a look around! They also sell Venezuelan candies and make some incredible churros if you still have room for dessert after :)100% Recommend!",
      "Obsessed with this place - would go back if I went to Miami.They were doing free arepitas if you ordered a wine (we got sangria which was very good and had apple pieces in it). Fresh and yummy. The domino arepa was so fresh and had the perfect firmness (idk if it was toasted or grilled or what but it was perfect) and warmth. It was nice and filling. The cheese that they top everything with is so yummy and salty - almost like soft pieces of Amul butter cheese (if anyone has ever tried that)Dessert was all topped with hazelnut chocolate - you will need multiple people sharing this dessert with you if you got an app and a main.Our server was so wonderful and fun and accommodating for a group of 9 - need to update my review once I get her name :)",
      "Thank you for your feedback, Shweta! We hope you can come back when you are in Miami!",
      "DoorDashed the octopus salad, pork belly arepa, and arepa Santa Barbara. Absolutely loved all of it. The Guasacaca sauce - despite the awkward name was the run away star in the sauce department. It's basically a Venezuelan guacamole. Wonderfully flavorful, well balanced. Excellent all the way around. The picante (spicy) sauce was my second favorite. I wish I had ordered more of both of these. The one I thought I would like most - the garlic sauce - sort of tasted like mayo with a hint of garlic and nail polish remover. It was not what we were expecting. However the fried plantains were 10/10. Well carmelized, with a phenomenal cheese on top. I could have eaten several orders of just those and been happy. The octopus salad was quite good too. The octopus was surprisingly tender - which is a challenging feat with that protein. It typically ends up either tough or bland, and this was neither. Tender and flavorful. On top of tostadas, with guac and hot sauce was probably my favorite bite of the night.",
      "Hi Ken! We are so glad you enjoyed our food! Hope you can come back soon!",
      "Heard great things about Doggi's and I finally went and it definitely lived up to my expectations! The staff was super friendly and sat me down immediately! The passion fruit juice was extremely refreshing!To start we got Tajadas Guru and it was delicious! I loved the combination of sweet and salty.For the main course I ordered an arepa with picanha steak and grilled cheese. It came out very fast and was so so good! The only annoying thing was the parking but we ended up finding a spot right in front!I would definitely recommend doggis if you want authentic venezuelan food!",
      "WOW! I have been coming to Doggis for a few years now and it never disappoints. It is a very small place so if you come during lunch or dinner, expect to wait a bit. In addition, the parking situation is a bit annoying sometimes as there is very limited parking but let me tell you, it is worth it! Once seated, the staff takes care of you quickly and helps you with any questions you may have. I always order a passion fruit juice and my mouth waters every time! We ordered the tajadas by guru which are fried plantains with grilled cheese, shredded cheese, and nata (Venezuelan sour cream). It's a lot of food but you will not regret ordering this!! I then ordered an arepa with churrasco and shredded cheese. This is my go to! I eat it with the garlic sauce they provide at the table and it is so delicious.Would recommend Doggis to those who are looking for authentic Venezuelan food!",
      "I used to regularly go to Doggis around 6 years ago when living in the area for a few months. I finally got to go back and it was as amazing as I remember. There was a special going on where we got arepitas with an order of a pitcher. I also got the tequeños, yuca fries, an arepa pabellon with chicken and churros for dessert. Everything was delicious and I highly recommend asking for both the cilantro and hot sauce with your arepa. Service was very kind and friendly and I really enjoyed my dining experience. Would honestly eat here every day if I lived close by",
      "Thank you for coming back, Avanti! We will be waiting for you!",
      "This is a small venue so make sure you arrive early enough to score a seat inside.  We arrived for an early lunch and we're seated very quickly.  There were only a few tables available; however, those filled up quick.  It was a full house and customer service was great.  Our drink order was taken quite quickly. I chose the sangria and it was very refreshing!I chose the red snapper frita and I loved it.  The presentation alone was amazing!  The light flaky perfectly cooked snapper was super delicious!We also ordered a beef arepa. The meat was perfectly seasoned and & juicy. I would definitely recommend and I will certainly return!",
      "Thank you for your visit! Next time, you should try our Doggi's Parrilla, an excellent option to share!",
      "Food:Santa Barbara (10/10): this was DELICIOUS. I really wanted to get more Latin cuisines on my weekend trip to Miami. So glad I came to this place. Service: 6/10We got here before the dinner rush and put our names down for a party of THREE. There was a little bit of a wait. Then a big party of 6 or 8 came and was seated WAY BEFORE us. I was really upset this happened without explanation. I like to think I am generally understanding, but this added 20-30 minutes of wait for us. It left a really sour taste in my mouth that the big party was seated before us without reservation. When we got inside, the servers were nice. I still tipped but I regret it after how long they made us wait to get seated without explaining why we had to wait longer than the people who came after us. General:5 stars for food, minus 2 stars for the seating experience.",
      "Thank you for your visit! We'll keep working on our service to bring a better experience for all our customers! Hope that you can visit us again soon!",
      "Love this place. I'm from Colombia and this reminds me of home. Delicious arepas with any and all options (veg as well). The tequeños are always great. Our waiter Mauricio was awesome and mentioned the Christmas special that we will be back to try. Love me some pernil. We were craving something more after our lame dinner and this second dinner really hit the spot. I also bought an assortment of candies, cause Ovomaltina has my heart. It's like a Nutella vibe but better imho. This place is truly great for breakfast, lunch or dinner. Definitely one of my usual spots when I'm craving an arepa.",
      "Best arepa in Miami ! Love this place so much! I hadn't gone in such a long time, so I decided to stop by and I ordered an arepa con queso and bacon, the arepa was mouth watering, crispy strips of bacon, with the queso rallado ( shredded cheese ). It was to die for, the arepa was hot and melted in my mouth. I enjoyed it with a Colombiana soda which is perfect to wash it down with. the service was good, the server was quick and helpful I told her I was in a bit of a rush and she did everything to get me my food in a timely manner.Once again this place delivers both good food and service! I will be a loyal customer forever.",
      "Small Venezuelan place with amazing food including Venezuelan favorites like patacon and arepas. Good prices! Place is always clean and well organized! REALLY FRIENDLY staff!!!! The people here are so nice I can talk to them for hours!!! They always treat me so nice and make my experience so much better. They have a huge menu with so many options and you can't go wrong with anything you choose! The food: CACHAPA, ( great texture, sweet, so much cheese and so much favor ). DOGGI'S BURGER. Good quality ground beef! A lot of cheese and fresh lettuce and Tomato, topped off with the doggi's special sauce and potato sticks. Street parking but hard to find sometimes! Well recommended place!"

      "What an amazing spot, we absolutely LOVED it. It's fairly young and trendy, so I would not take my baby boomer parents here (or a baby in general)- but for a younger, fun, lively crowd, this is perfect. The inside is really cool - lots of artwork, somewhat hidden restaurant, similar to a speakeasy. The drinks were unique and incredible and the food was OUTSTANDING! Very gastronomic - if you're into that sort of thing (my parents wouldn't get it). We basically ordered the entire menu, until we nearly exploded. Here were a few memorable plates (as in, those I can remember after imbibing for a few hours)...Spanglish milk bread - the black salt on top. WOW. They say, once you go black (salt), you never go back right? Exactly. The guava butter was unlike any butter I have ever had. It's very tropical, and fruity! Wagyu beef ravioli - that blue cheese sauce was to die for - take some of that milk bread and drunk your bread in this sauce to your heart's desire (and worry about the consequences later, because bread and cheese, whew!) Nitro Watermelon Tataki - the only remotely healthy thing that entered our mouths at dinner. It's such a cool fish - watermelon, pomegranate seeds, toasted pumpkin seeds, olive oil and a total flavor overload. Not to mention the fact that the fish came out looking like sashimi grade tuna. So cool. Arroz Mamposteado - this was a cool fish. It was rice and beans, but mixed with avocado creme and and pork belly and chips. Incredible. I'm not much of a dessert but holy smokes did we devour the suspiro. I'm quite positive I licked the jar towards the end of the evening - don't judge me. I wish I could remember what cocktail I had, but the choices are all so unique and fun, I should have tried them all. Eh, gives me a reason to go back, right?!",
      "Thank you so much for the kind words and the detailed review of all of our dishes, Shannon.  It was a pleasure hosting you, and we look forward to your next visit!",
      "Obsessed is an understatement.Found this place on Yelp (I love you Yelp!) and with the rating and images I knew I was SOLD. The show stopping, craft cocktails is what I came for and I wasn't sure what to expect once we came. Was it a hype? Would I be disappointed? Who cares! You're in Miami and going to a Spanglish cocktail bar. We didn't make reservations but we did read it wasn't too hard to get in. And it was exactly just that. Came here at around 9:30 pm on a Saturday night and we were seated to the side entrance table with couches right away. It wasn't a good option for dining but we literally only came here for the cocktails so it was perfect!The vibe check in this place was everything. There was a live dj tucked in to the side making sure the music was on point. And it was!On to the craft cocktails:I ordered the Pornstar Mejican@ and it was delicious wish the mezcal was more of the star of the show and to be honest, given that everyone else's cocktails were truthfully visually so pleasing wish the presentation for this one was as well but that's totally ok!!! I still loved my experience. My hubby ordered the Cafetera Old Fashioned and WOW. What a presentation and fun way to serve it with an actual cafetera. It was definitely a show stopper. The Caipirinha Frizá was delicious and very unique as well and the Paparazzi came served in a photo lens so that was pretty cool!We loved Spanglish, would be back in a heart beat. Overall great vibes for cocktails and pretty cool presentation that really makes this place stand out. Excited to try their food next time!",
      "This place gives my New York Vibes OD! It's definitely giving New York Speakeasy Vibes. You'll probably miss it if your not paying attention because the sign outside is only a neon bottle sign. Inside is intimate with the cutest decor, low key, playing all the classic jams. I love a place that sets a vibe with an good playlist! Okayyy! We came for drinks after dinner, so we didn't order food but they did have a menu. All the drinks we ordered were sooo freakin good, and were in creative instagram worthy cups. This is definitely going to be my new hideaway spot. Service was amazing! Will be coming back!",
      "Okay, here's the thing with this place, it's so freaking loud that you can barely hear the person next to you, it's impossible to have any sort of conversation with a large group of people. The food was okay and drinks were pretty good on the other hand, so I think this is a good place for dates, just not a large gathering.",
      "Hi Anton, thank you so much for taking the time to share your experience at Spanglish.  We apologize for the music being too loud, and this is something we’re going to adjust.  Although, we’re happy to hear you enjoyed the drinks!We hope to see you again soon!",
      "What an awesome chic place.  Amazing craft cocktail & gastro pub style tapas.

      "The entrance to Spanglish is so subtle that it's easy to miss! Once you enter, the ambiance is cozy, intimate, and welcoming. We came because of the happy hour -- their cocktails were $9 and some small dishes were marked down! We ordered a round of the caipirinhas first and sadly were a bit disappointed, it was way more tart than expected and just tasted like lemon juice. The Chilcano tasted similar with the overpowering citrus. The Spanglish mule was way better! For small plates, we ordered the octopus croquettes, Caribbean dumplings, and a side of yuca. The octopus croquettes were my favorite of the items we ordered -- crispy, served hot, and the octopus inside was tender. The Caribbean dumplings were a little mushy, and the yuca was a bit tough and the sauce it was served with tasted like Big Mac sauce which I am not a fan of. Everything came out pretty fast, though!",
      "Finally got to visit Spanglish and let's just say I fell in love! I came here for happy hour with a friend and honestly we were blown away by how delicious everything was. We ordered the Spanish Milk Bread, Timba Frita, Queso E' Craba , and Tuna Tostadas. My favorite dish we tried was the Timbra Frita. It was the perfect bite full of flavor. We also ordered cocktails. We both ordered the Paparazzi which honestly tasted amazing but the presentation was killer. It comes served in a camera lens. Overall this place is a vibe. The music was lit. They were playing bad bunny. The artwork is awesome. I definitely see myself coming back here.",
      "Location a bit hidden in plain sight, so be sure to stop and read signs. Small  and intimate setting with a great ambiance for drinks and light bites with friends. The food was ok nothing over the top or extraordinary. I did like my margarita with the seafood bites. Drinks here before a walk around in Wynwood is never a bad idea.",
      "This place has no sign in front. We drive up and down and finally found it. Outside looks like it was closed. Nothing indicating it was opened except for a sign out front that shows menu of the day. We walked it and surprisingly was like wow. This is a cute small cozy restaurant.  The booth I say were pretty close to one another.  The bar area has 6 stools. The food was excellent! Extremely flavorful and so good. The octopus appetizer was amazing. We ordered one of their popular dish and weren't disappointed.  I forgot to photo that dish because I was so hungry.  Everything we had was great including the drinks. We love craft drinks and for sure it was super crafty. The paparazzi drink was so cute. It came in a camera cup and tasted great.I would be definitely coming back here again soon and recommend everyone to try if you haven't been here.",
      "Came here to try a few drinks on a Friday night and it wasn't as busy as I expected. I was able to sit at the bar and watch the bartender make these really cool looking and tasty drinks! The paparazzi was my favorite. Something about the dill and passion fruit combination was something I didn't know I needed. The vuela paloma was just okay, I'm just not the biggest fan of grapefruit. And the cafetera old fashioned tasted like a REALLY strong Cuban coffee, which I really enjoyed. Although the drinks were great, the vibe was kinda ruined by these drunk idiots sitting next to us at the bar, yelling and screaming. But I would still come here again to enjoy a cool curated cocktail."

      "Overall: Amazing food. We will definitely be back! The Great: - Biscetta allá Fiorantina. We got the serving for 2. Incredible. - Tiramisu OMG - get it. - Tableside Caesar - Very nice server - Ben - Foccacia bread The good: - Meatball App - The wine cellar and steak presentation as you walk in is a nice touch General feedback: - Dimming the lights a bit more would give it some real ambiance and a homier feel  - They JUST opened so cut the staff some slack. I've been on a team opening a restaurant before and it's so hard. They did great! - Good location - easy access with ample parking. A local steakhouse is just what the neighborhood needs - The staff was really sweet and everyone was really working hard all night.",
      "Went here for a birthday dinner. They have a great menu with all sorts of selections.  Our waiter was pushy and rude.  We ordered a NY Strip, Branzino, Pasta Bolonaize, Filet Minan, truffle fries and salad.  The steaks were ordered medium well done.  All the food was good except the steaks.  They kept bringing back the steaks rare and the waiter was angry with nasty comments toward us.  If you go here avoid this guy.  We told the mgr who seemed surprised.",
      "The staff and Marco was amazing! The food, absolutely Devine, the portion the flavor, the attention to detail were all perfection. Thank you for making my husband's 40th bday so memorable.",
      "Hello my name is Nick. Of course I'm from New York. I usually don't write reviews specially bad ones we got to this nice restaurant very gorgeous inside. The bread was delicious. I have to say the first course was a pasta dish we split. It had a Bolognese sauce on it it was served hot and good. Little did I know that was the highlight of a dinner. My steak came out first they cut it up which I wasn't crazy about but it was cold. my friends ordered a veal dish a special order. They accommodated them but the dish also was ice cold. The dish presentation was very nice but it being cold was definitely a problem. I must mention the sides to twice cook baked potato was a baked potato not twice cooked. The cream spinach was nice fresh baby spinach sautéed with melted cheese on top. The menu, said cream of spinach. I do wish they would get their act together, and I would even consider trying it again. The Decour is very elegant. It was Christmas Eve. We got there at 6:15 and it wasn't that busy. There was no excuse for the cold food. I must say I was very disappointed. My name is nick hogan.",
      "Nice bar.  Quality food.   Good service    Except bartender Angie.  Good wine and liquor selection",
      "Great new restaurant. Not crowded yet. We got frutti dimare and branzino, both dishes were excellent. I especially liked that unlike many other places they go easy on a salt. Highly recommend!",
      "Rippoff stupid place out of place Does not belong among working class neighborhood Just close down and go to Ball Harbor",
      "Ridiculous prices for a basic Italian restaurant It will never make it in NMB Will not bring lunch customers at this prices Dinner customers will go to a well known reliable restaurant",
      "My boyfriend and I had been waiting for what felt like an eternity for this place to open because we love Frank so we had to check out a place named after his iconic song. Just like his song, our experience was great! The place feels intimate and has a great ambiance for a date night. The food was also incredible! Yet, the best part was the service. Our server Andrea was so sweet and helpful the entire night. I highly recommend!",
      "One of the most authentic Italian restaurants I've ever eaten at!  First rate and class-  Look forward to having many more meals at My Way!  Thanks to the incredible staff for an incredible evening.",
      "Perfect place for date night! The food was amazing and the staff very friendly and attentive. Can not go wrong with the BURRATA CAPRESE for starter and my favorite the FILETTO DI MANZO! So many tasty options can't wait to go back next time I am in town!"

      "Seaspice was amazing. It's a fantastic restaurant with a great view right on the Miami River. If you don't right you can catch the live music as the sun sets, and the restaurant transforms to a lounge. Totally worth coming Parking is tricky, and if you're not paying attention you might miss it as you drive by. But it's a gem worth coming back to.",
      "Seaspice is known to Miami locals as a very high end resturant, frequented by celebrities.  I have no idea why.  The service is pretty awful.  The drink runners are horrible.  It takes about 30 minutes for just a drink to be brought out to you.  The food is mediocre.  It is definitely NOT worth the price, which is very expensive.  I am giving two stars because the view is amazing.  Seaspice is right on the water and has a gorgeous ambiance.  You can watch yachts drive by and some will even pull up and park.  The other star is for the tres leches.  This dessert was AMAZING, I would go back just to eat it again.  But otherwise, Seaspice is nothing special.  Save your money.",
      "A place that tries to be high end but fails to deliver.Service ? Mediocre Food ? Below parFirst thing when you check in is they tell you that you have a 2 hr max(tacky)",
      "I read this was one of the best patio dining AND a hot spot for celebrities in Miami, so I had to go check it out on our recent travels to this area...Initially I was worried about our luggage situation, as we had to carry our luggage to the restaurant since this was our last stop in Miami. However, they were very accommodating, and let us store some of our stuff in the closet, and we kept the big luggage with us, near our table.As expected, the patio scene was spectacular...city skyline and seaside views, with plenty of yachts passing by! The place indeed had that chic celebrity vibe...truly FAB! Loved the music overhead as well. Somehow, I expected some snobbiness...but not at all. Service was great!Then the food. OMFG...I've had some amazing foods lately, but this takes the cake. Even the complimentary bread was amazing (and unique)! My husband ordered this Wagyu Burger, and I chose this Ragu Pappardelle ( THE best Ragu Pappardelle I've ever had...EVER. ). Then this Pavola dessert...again, just beyond delish. Truly, this was foods for the celebrities.Honestly, I'm shocked at how low the rating is for this place. I assume that if the service isn't top notch, it would probably piss some folks off. The pricing was on the outlandish side...with even lunch entrees starting at around 40. There was even an appetizer item priced at around 70 bucks! Luckily, like I said, I felt that the foods and the service (and especially the spectacular ambiance) made up for it. There was this big yacht parked right near us, which somewhat blocked some of the views from the left. Still, we got our eyeful of seaside/yachtside views.In any case, this was a great way to end our trip in Miami.",
      "Went here with a group of girlfriends for brunch and everything was delicious, they were super accommodating as well.I had the froze , a cucumber and gin cocktail and 2 grey goose and sodas and all were fantastic.As a table we split the fresh fish and a couple sides and it was delicious. Also love the free bread It is definitely on the pricier side overall tbh but great for a fun \"fancy\" brunch",
      "Came here for Miami spice and although we spent more than we thought we would, we had a good time. Everything was delicious. The kale Caesar had pecans and Granny Smith apple slices, never had a Caesar like this but it was a nice change! The Shrimp Pesto Whole Wheat Spaghetti was my favorite, even though I'm not the biggest fan of pesto. The burger was good too just a little messy from the truffle aioli. The chocolate cremoso and tres leches was very good but I'd go with the cremoso for the cocoa nib crumble, yum! All in all, I think it's overpriced and I probably won't come here again because of that. The cheapest bottle of Chardonnay was $75 and most drinks were $20. I only came here for Miami spice and still spent almost $200.",
      "Given we still have Miami Spice going on until the end of the month we decided to try out the lunch menu @ Seaspice gorgeous location on the Miami River, sitting outdoor is really relaxing, so beautiful to watch the boats go by, really lovely To start we had the Comte' Cheese Soufflé, I have to admit this was a bit disappointing, it really did not have the texture of a real soufflé  but then............ the Shrimp Pesto Whole Wheat Spaghetti and the Pan-Seared Chilean Seabass were really good as dessert, both the Tres Leches and the Chocolate Cremoso were yummy Try it out before Miami Spice ends, you can check out the Miami Spice Menus on miamiandthebeaches.com@seaspicemia",
      "First time for me at Seaspice, it is located on the banks of the Miami River it is a gem that you should not miss. Sit outside in the courtyard enjoy your food and a drinks while watching the boats go by, just beautiful We had the Miami Spice lunch which has a very affordable fix price 3 course menu for $ 28, unfortunately this will end soon, nevertheless, I would defiantly go back again for sureRegarding the Miami Spice menu only one observation, they should have had more than one choice for the Entrees without the extra charge, right now you have 4 choices and 3 of these have extra charge on it, not really fair given that you are promoting the Spice menu, you should have at least two or three choices included in the price and one or two with the extra charge We had had Prince Edward Island Mussels, Grilled, the Grilled Faroe Island Salmon and the Profiteroles and Peaches and Cream. My favorite where the Mussels, the garlic pizza bread they brought for the table was absolutely delicious, the Salmon was good too. I had the Peaches for dessert and it was ok, not really my thing, my friend said the Profiteroles were great, next time I will not opt for the healthy dessert We enjoyed all with a good Albariño wine, our experience was made especially enjoyable by our waiter Fabrizio, he was really great ! Thank you Fabrizio @seaspicemia",
      "Bad first impression. Its not a nice feeling to feel like you have to beg to spend your money at a restaurant. Every year I look forward to Miami Spice. It's a great way to try out various restaurants and a unique spread of menu options. Seaspice was on my radar and happened to be one of the participating restaurants offering the Miami Spice menu. I contacted the restaurant in advance and made a reservation for 3:30p for a party of four. My mom who is from out of town was excited to join us for lunch. I advised the restaurant we were doing the Miami Spice menu. The restaurant made it clear that they charge $50pp for No Shows. At 3:15pm, we arrived for our reservation. The hostess Karin greeted us, and advised us that they were running behind on the reservations and because of this they will not be able to offer the Miami Spice menu. Only the a la-carte menu will be offered. This was a bit upsetting because we drove almost an hour to get there and the restaurant is refusing to offer the Miami Spice promotion. Our natural instinct was to just say forget it we will go somewhere else. I mean, at the end of the day who wants to beg to spend their money? It's absurd. If the restaurant is offering a promotional menu and because to no fault of our own they are running behind why should we be penalized?My Mom looked so bummed out. Because she was so excited to try this place. I decided to walk back in and ask for a Manager. The Manager took 20min to come out. When he finally did come over, he introduced himself as Collin. I explained to him what was going on and it seemed as though he wasn't aware that the hostesses were turning Miami Spice customers away. He decided to make it right and advised Karin to honor the Miami Spice menu. Impressive! Things were turning around. Besides the encounter at the hostess stand, the restaurant is beautiful. It is situated on Miami's waterfront were you can view the million dollar yachts passing by. They also have docks for those interested in docking and dining. You can view the downtown city skyline which I am sure looks amazing at night.The food was excellent. The Miami Spice menu offered a three course lunch for $28. You have the choice of a starter (Kale Salad, Cheese Souffle, or White Gazpacho). A choice of entrees (Seabass, Chicken Breast, Shrimp Pesto Pasta, Wagyu Burger, or Plant Bowl). And a choice of dessert (Tres Leches or Chocolate Cremoso). They also offer the option to add a Glass of wine for and additional $12. I ordered the Comte Cheese Souffle, the Green Circle Farms Chicken Breast, and the Tres Leches. The others in my party ordered the Kale Salad, Gazpacho, and Seabass. For starters, My favorites were the Kale Caesar Salad and Cheese Souffle. The Kale Caesar had a mix of shredded Granny Smith apples, pecans and a creamy Caesar dressing. The cheese Souffle was like a fluffy egg Souffle with a cream parmesan sauce and tomato chutney. Delicious!For entrees, both the Seabass and Chicken breast were amazing. The Chicken breast was tender and juicy, served on top of a creamy polenta and topped with corn, peas, and mushrooms. The seabass was seared nicely to give a nice crunch on the outside, while perfectly flaky and moist on the inside. It was served with stewed garbanzo, Swiss chard, and smoked potato. For desserts, we all had Tres Leches. It was served in a small Mason jar topped with 3 milks, and berries. Perfect way to end the meal. The portions are not large but it is filling. The flavors are fresh and very well balanced. The food presentation was notable. The Watermelon Tequila drink was delightful and refreshing. The froze was also a big hit. The cocktails were presented well and created perfectly. We enjoyed everything. Our waiter, Austin was very friendly. He made great recommendations and was very attentive.An 18% gratuity was added to the tab. There are lots of street parking accessible. In the end, the food was great. Ambience was amazing. The hostesses can use additional customer service training and learn to use better judgment to improve the customers experience. There was no need to escalate the matters to a manager. It could have been handled properly by showing empathy, apologizing, and finding a solution to the problem.",
      "Hi Kim,Thank you for dining with us and leaving a detailed review. It has been forwarded to our management team. Our apologies for the confusion at the door.  Glad to hear Collin accommodated you and your experience was turned around.  We are happy to see your great feedback regarding the food, cocktails, and Austin’s Service.  Hopefully you will join us again in the near future!",
      "This is my second time going to sea spice & I normally love it as the first time. I never leave bad reviews But this second time MY PHONE WAS STOLEN AND SECURITIES DID NOThing about it. Instead we're trying to blame me for the situation. I'm not drunk nor was drunk. I walked in with 2 phone and walked out with 1.We came as my friend USUALLY does and this is how they treated us  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME. I thought it was 5 star so nothing could go wrong. With a security right next to our table my phone STILLL got stolen. It was on the table. And to whoever has the time to steal phones is just sad imagine what else they can steal... I wil ask to review cameras but with the way I was treated when I let them know I lost my phone I doubt they will be helpful but I'll let every platform form of review know that they steal phones here. I know the exact time frame as well so they wouldn't even have to look much at the cameras. Let's see. BTW I BEEN HOME SICK AFTER EATING THESE OYSTERS I COULDNT Even celebrate my baby's birthday w him.",
      "Came here for my birthday dinner with my boyfriend for a 7:15 reservation (we called in advance for an outdoor seat dock side) we waited about ten minutes after our arrival for our table to be ready at the bar, the short wait was definitely worth it. Started with an aperol spritz at the bar then ordered octopus and gazpacho to start. Octopus portion was good but the olive oil tasted burnt since it came out on a sizzling hot cast iron looking skillet (its very easy to overcook octopus, please just bring a regular plate next time.) I also had the whole main lobster. Extremely delicious large portion of perfectly cooked and seasoned lobster, bravo. My boyfriend had the truffle coated Chilean sea bass and he absolutely loved it. Vibe: 5/5 this place definitely is a scene but not overwhelmingly pretentious or obnoxious. Absolutely loved the music as well. Service:3/5 A bit slow, our server was very attentive when we were able to get his attention but we had to always wave him down. Food: 4/5 everything was honestly pretty good (octopus could've had a bit more attention to detail)",
      "Hi Liz,Thank you for celebrating your birthday with us!  We are so happy to hear you had a great experience and enjoyed the food.  Your feedback regarding the octopus has been sent to our chef. We look forward to seeing you again soon!"

      "Lets rewind 1.5 years ago. Found this place by chance and had such an amazing chicken coconut curry dish that today i came back to have it. I went in gentleman was nice, brought me the chicken coconut curry dish and it looked different, the avocado was also yellow with black spots on it. Tried it and there was no curry, no coconut, uncooked tomato's, sauce tasted full blast mustard. I told him that this was not the same dish i had before and he didn't even ask me if i wanted something else, or a refund, nothing! Came back and tried to show me the difference between his mustard and his curry sauces which were in squeeze bottles. He proceeded without my knowledge to make me another dish. I told him i will pay for everything else I ordered but do not have time to wait for another dish i had to pick up my son. In all my years in miami and in this country and as a business owner i have never encountered a person who had an unhappy customer and refused to refund them!!!!!! Insane!!! Of course I flipped my shit which is unlike me!! But this guy was not trying to accommodate only with another dish and said he has a family  to feed!! Well get your dishes in order and dont try and fool people!. Anyways my dog didn't even eat the salmon that i got for her which i had no complaints to pay for. Well if the dog wont eat it! Why would you!! Beware!!This is my second bad review i have ever written! Not my thing but this place deserves it! Karma in full effect!!",

      "Though everything was perfect, it was a little overpriced for the amount of food you're served. Good customer service, quick to offer tips of what to eat. There's plenty of seating and a big tv screen on the sports channel. I had a breakfast wrap with scrambled egg, turkey and Swiss cheese ($7) along with a cold coffee ($4). Metered parking along the street. Will maybe come back in a bind.",
      "Manuel our server accommodated us pretty well. We had a promotion that came from Yelp and for a second they weren't about to acknowledge it but it was more so due to the fact that Manuel didn't know of it. Outside of that the service was really good and the food was actually pretty solid I will say the price is a little high for the portions but the food was definitely quality very fresh and a decent amount of flavor. I live close to the spot for like more than 2 years and I never checked it out. I'm glad I was able to check it out this time",
      "This my 3rd time coming and first time this year. I love walking here and there's always a friendly face across the counter. The bowls are all delicious and today I had the salmon bowl with pickled cucumbers, cuscus and a yogurt mint tomato side. Very healthy and fulfilling. I like to get a good portion of protein in for lunch so I had enough energy for my walk back and work. With having so many places to eat in Miami, I come here not only because the food is good but because I get quality ingredients and it's homemade the chefs take pride in making your food. If you share a photo on social media the give you a little sweet dessert and if you check in you get a free Nutella bread pudding! If that doesn't make you come here I don't know what else to tell you.",
      "Super delicious and fresh food! Not overpriced and on point!Again worth coming to and coming back too! Fresh made food daily in here!"

      "Super attention to great flavor and food delivery. If you want a true Italian experience this is a good choice. Staff are native Italian with English as a second language so you get a real Old World experience here. If you need a big chain escalator ride then go elsewhere but if all you need is excellent Italian then choose Vero.",
      "Looking for a quant Italian eatery off the beaten path in Miami? Vero Italian has you covered. With an extensive wine list, they have a vino for every level of wine aficionado. On a recent visit for work, Vero played host to our Staff/Board Meeting. Though a little understaffed, they did awesomely with my parties orders. While here I had the lambchops and roasted potatoes.  Very delicious to the last bite! The accurate name for my dish appears in my photo caption. Will definitely visit again!",
      "Sad to say but what a terrible experience. We were so excited about this restaurant for all the reviews and recommendations, but unfortunately our experience was terrible. We arrived and there were only 2 ppl seating on the outside of the restaurant, so they weren't busy. We asked for the pizza, but they didn't have it, we asked the waiter for a bruschetta recommendation and she recommended the provolone one... horrible. The bread was way too toasted and the sausage tasted horrible. I also asked for the lasagna and 45 min after I ordered, they said they burned it out and they didn't have another one for me. So I had to order pasta. After 55 min and again, only 2 ppl on the restaurant so they weren't busy, they finally brought the food, the pasta was cold, one of the pasta was supposed to be spicy but it had no flavor and on top of everything my bologna had like a piece of something green inside.... 1.5 hour wasted and we still paid and the tip was included... oh almost forget... it took us like 20 min to get the check because we couldn't find our waiter...",
      "The restaurant is lowkey excellent Italian. Love the food so much and it has great food options too. The quality is great and decent. Perfect for special occasions. The wine is perfect with the food. Definitely will always go for pasta and it has good texture and flavor, the salad taste so fresh too. The service is amazing and really wonderful too.",
      "Quite Italian spot close by the hotel we visited on our way to The Bahamas. I would recommend this spot if you're close to the downtown Miami area.",
      "Oh my god, this food was amazing! I had the carbonara, and though I wish it was a bit creamier and eggy, I'm glad it wasn't super greasy like most are made. My sister had a simple tomato penne but the tomato sauce was so good, best tomato sauce I've tried at any Italian restaurant. The service was lovely and the ambience was so precious and homey. 10/10 recommend!",
      "I stayed in downtown during my visit to Miami and my boyfriend and I decided to go to Vero for dinner. The indoor decor was cute and cozy. We were seated immediately and were told they weren't serving pizza that night. We ordered the penne alla vodka and bucatini a amatraciana as our entrees. They were able to accommodate my request to remove pork from the bucatini. I enjoyed the bucatini, the sauce was spicy and I loved the thick noodles. The vodka pasta however was really meaty, the taste of the tomato sauce was overpowered by the meat taste and smell which we both were not expecting. Portions were decent, we were able to finish the majority of our meal.",
      "Very lowkey Italian spot for the area that it's in in Miami. Authentic style Italian, pastas were great. Highly recommend the burrata appetizer. They also have Peroni on draft if you're looking for a drink.",
      "The food is delicious. Great little hole on the wall restaurant. Portion is a little small but taste amazing.",
      "This place is super authentic. All made in the House.They take care of your needs and all in great effort to comply with the Order"

      "This is a separate bakery from the Versailles Restaurant. They have a great system. The ladies are quick and deserve lots of tips. I was fortunate to have a server who spoke English. I got a bunch of Cuban pastries and she packed them in a cute box for me to go. My cafe con Leche was perfectly made! This was a well oiled customer centered bakery. So many wonderful dessert and pastry choices!",
      "I hate to leave a slightly negative review for this restaurant because I have heard so many good things about it from my Cuban girlfriend, her family and Youtubers. It's supposed to be so much better than anything we have in Southern California. I don't know if I should be happy or sad to say that I believe the Cuban food in Southern California to be better than this restaurant.First of all, like most of my experience in Miami during my recent trip, the people don't seem to be friendly including the staff here. It kind of feels like they're going through the motions with the exception of the ladies working in the ventanita when they see familiar faces coming back for more coffee. The hostess outside and the wait staff inside really seemed to be just going through the motions. I got the ropa vieja and my girlfriend ordered the boliche. Ropa vieja is always my go to when I try a new Cuban restaurant. I know it well. It was extremely under flavored here. It was nothing special. I wish I had ordered anything other than this. Her boliche was missing the sausage. I don't know much about this dish, but that seems like a very important thing to leave out when making this dish. I tried what was on the plate and it didn't seem like anything special to me. We checked out the bakery while we were there, and we were equally unimpressed. We did try the ventanita before going inside for lunch. We got a colada and I didn't think it was anything special. It was very sweet and we shared it between the two of us. I didn't get any kind of caffeine buzz from it at all. Part of me is glad I tried this restaurant because I've heard so many things about it over the years and I actually did think the ambience was very interesting especially the decorated mirrors inside. I just wish the food was better. There are numerous Cuban restaurants local to where I live that I really do think have better food. I was very surprised by this. By the way, this was my birthday lunch for my 45th and I was really hoping for something amazing.",
      "Cafe Versailles was disappointing to start. The croquettes were cold, hard, and tasted bland. The empanada texture/consistency was not right and just tasted very floury and as if it had been sitting - they could have at least warmed it up. I mean, I could have asked but they were NOT friendly at all here. Cuban sandwich was tasted old and also as if it had been sitting. I'm not even sure why they were serving it when it was hard as a rock.Service? What service? The staff here is rude, comes off as condescending and will rush you. I'm not sure if it's a cultural thing or what but it doesn't happen at the local cuban eateries out here in So Cal.",
      "This place is amazing, best Cuban food in Miami, for sure! We try to visit here every time we're in Miami and we never get tired of the authentic atmosphere and food. The service is top notch in that there probably one server to every four tables. You get the attention you deserve as a paying customer, that's for sure! The place is huge so the wait is never more than 30 minutes. Our server was there to answer any questions we had about the menu and took drink orders muy rapído! The menu is extensive and their prices are very affordable. Must try their house Sangria and for sure the Cuban sandwich. But there are many other choices as you will see on my pictures. If you're in Miami, Versailles in Little Havana, Calle 8, is the place! I highly recommend their food, but most importantly I commend thier staff for great service!!",
      "This is our favorite place in Miami. The stuff here is amazing and the prices are also amazing. We *love* their Cafe con Leche (I prefer without evaporated milk). Their fresh orange juice is super refreshing. We highly recommend everyone try their guava and cheese pastelitos. This place is a Miami staple and has been around for 50 years. The service is kind, quick, and welcoming. Definitely recommend this to anyone who is visiting Miami because it's a great representation of Miami culture/food but also extremely affordable.",
      "I returned to this iconic location. Most places that have received so much recognition and generations, tend to change or adjust, not Cafe Versailles, they take pride in every dish, they give consistent service and the place is clean for the amount of traffic they receive daily. I think Cuban food is comfort food and the dish I had was just that, an explosion of flavor and a story of their history. Beautifully prepared and perfectly seasoned. We finished off our lunch with ... yes cuban coffee! My life is complete!",
      "Ahhh another taste of Cuba! This food journey in Florida is so fun. Café Versailles is authentic Cuban cuisine. Every morning should start out this way with a delicious pastry called \"pastelillo de guava y queso\" and a Cuban coffee. An absolute staple! The pastry is off the hook flaky buttery delicious. The filling is amazing and well balanced. If you are an apple pie with cheese this is a whole other level. The Cuban coffee is obviously delicious and a nice complement to the pastry.",
      "This review is for the Miami Airport in Terminal D. Unfortunately here you don't have much of a choice for Cuban breakfast but today I ordered a Cuban toast (tostada), something so simple, and the bread was pretty tough and probably old. I was pretty disappointed and I would not recommend it. Maybe get something else!",
      "This is a bold statement... but these are probably the best croquetas de bacalao that I've ever had. I wish I had ordered more! The orange juice was so refreshing & the empanada de carne that I had was delicious. The bread in the Cuban sandwich was rock hard at first but they did not hesitate to make a new one right away & it was great! Don't let the long lines discourage you, service is great and fast!",
      "This is about Café Versailles, not Versailles Restaurant. The café, is a counter order with little sit-down area and mostly coffee-oriented, though they have Cuban Sandwich, Chicken Empanada, Cortadito, Papa Rellena, Meat Pie &, etc. More than anything it's the Cuban gathering place of Little Havana for refreshment and conversation.Though parking is a challenge, it's worth the stop not only for the real Cuban coffee but to share in on the Cuban life of Miami; a true delight.",
      "I've seen the place featured on videos and unexpectedly ended up here. I'm glad I did, so much so, ended up coming back the next day before leaving Miami. There's the bakery part, with small seating inside and some outside. Mostly everyone getting their daily coffee and pastry, que was long but the efficiency of caffeine helps as you can see your cashier enjoy her cafecito. Still nice to enjoy the Cuban style coffees which were delicious enough to just sit back and savor outside on a December day in South Florida. Pastries as fresh to me as they could be and best anything back home. I could see myself a regular. The dining portion connected is a treat. Again efficiency, the servers in their uniforms almost military like. Servers are prompt and helpful. Food came out quick even during a busy lunch hour. You can actually start your day at the bakery side and move over to enjoy your lunch which is what we did. The menu is rather large. Almost Cheescake Factory choice of options. So we stuck with the daily specials, which was great since most of these servings are none I've ever experienced in Tampa. They do have your favorite hits, but I love the plethora of options....and food that comes out on china with silverware, not styrofoam and plastic utensils like back home (please no mentions of that famous place in Ybor, that's for another review). Interior matches that experience that your actually dining. Nostalgic. Before we go into the main lunch dishes. The croquettes (ham) we had with coffee...between some saltine crackers was so delicious. Lightly fried, airy, not heavy at all and good enough on its on as a meal. I had the Gratinado con Queso. Imperial Rice. Rice cooked with Saffron and Deboned Chicken, Mayonnaise, Roasted Red Bell Peppers, a Hard Boiled Egg and Green Peas. Served with Sweet Plantains. Such a hearty meal. Rice with all of its ingredients combine with cheese on top, is so warming. Such comfort food. This dish appears as a special couple of days. Plantains we're just right. Paticas de Cerdo a La Andaluza. Pigs Feet Andalusian Style. Cooked in a Light TomatoSauce with Ham, Spanish Sausage and Chick Peas.Served with White Rice and Sweet Plantains. No one back home will have this unless you have someone make it for you at their house. A special on Wednesday. If you like pork, this is such a treat. Not fatty or greasy. Can't miss. I can't really remember the chicken dish that came out but just safe to say no leftovers. Everything plated well. I really wish I could visit more often. Have a usual coffee morning. And try everything on this large menu. Service was friendly and attentive. Can't wait to be back."

      "Ordered bacon and eggs and grits on Grubhub this morning. My biggest issue with bacon eggs is usually the bacon which I like cookie crisp and which usually comes undercooked. However the bacon  was PERFECTLY cooked, the eggs were good the grits were excellent. I also got a plain bagel with butter again no issues with that and again I want to comment on the bacon, it was really good. I would also call the portion of eggs and grits large fact I didn't even finish the eggs because it was a good size order.",
      "Found this spot on Yelp and decided to stop by for breakfast. They have a pretty vast menu selection of which can be a bit intimidating. I ordered my food to go and it didn't take long at all. Customer service didn't stand out but it wasn't a bad experience at all. Food: hard to say. Most of their breakfast items come with egg which I try to avoid. I got the loaded home fries with turkey bacon and no egg. I love breakfast potatoes but it was something about these that I wasn't fond of. I also got an everything bagel with plain cream cheese and an exotic blast smoothie. The smoothie was extremely good and refreshing. I'll come back for just that if I'm being honest. I'd probably try to come here for lunch next time or try something other than their potato dishes.",
      "Great place to stop in for a decent healthy meal.  You order at the counter and food will be brought out to you.  Menu offered a lot of different creations from sandehiches to salad bowls.  I ended up ordering the chicken Caesar salad.  Fresh salad with a nice crunch.  Enjoyed it very much. Their coffee is pretty good too.  Plenty of seatings throughout the resturant.",

      "Discovered this great eatery downstairs from an apartment we were looking at for our son. There was a steady flow of people and all seemed to be enjoying the atmosphere and delicious food. The menu was extensive. Hubby ordered us each an omelette- his minus the bread and potatoes. We had a seat and enjoyed people watching as we waited for our food to be brought to our table. Our order came out pretty quickly. I think it was the best omelette I've had in a long time- huge, fluffy and cooked to perfection! We really enjoyed our brunch and look forward to dining here again.",
      "Such a great place for a quick bite in Miami plus the prices are low! Breakfast is served all day but there is also a huge selection for lunch including wraps, sandwiches, and salads! Customer service is great so friendly and quick. The interior is very cute and modern. Such a fun vibe with music and a beautiful outdoor area (major plus for having fans blowing a mist!) I had the Hangover breakfast and it was so tasty and filling. Portion sizes were great and I ended up having enough left over that fed me and my husband the next morning! It was just a easy the next day! Definitely would return on my next trip to Miami",
      "I stopped by the Daily Creative Food with my boyfriend yesterday for a quick brunch. I haven't been to this place since they opened their first location in the south beach so it was nice to see it around. We ordered the American Breakfast and the Hangover breakfast. First, portions are huge for the price, it's really worth it and filling. You have parking right behind the place, free for 2 hours. We also ordered some coffee and we sit to wait for our order. 10 min later our order was ready and the server brought our food. We mentioned about our coffee and she said that we had to go get it at the coffee bar but she will bring it... well, she never brought it... actually, we saw her going on her way to the restaurant since we were sitting outside and she started to talk to a random lady and showed her things on her phone, and completely forgot about us. My boyfriend went to get the coffee and she didn't even apologize or anything, like it's ok, we could have gone and got but don't offer if you are not really going to do it. Also, that same server was sitting at one of the tables outside smoking and didn't look that proper for a place where people are eating, especially during work hours. Besides that, the food was good, great as a hangover cure!",
      "This is a consistent unfussy brunch place that serves breakfast all day. It's first come first serve seating which can be tricky when busy. The prices are reasonable, the staff is consistently bidding tables, and it's dog/kid friendly. You can really get a range of lunch or breakfast options to choose your own adventure, plus options of coffee, juices, or mimosas."

We had truffle yucca fries for the table - I'm not sure yucca is \"my thing\", but it itself was tasty. My husband ordered the shredded chicken plate, while I had the steak sandwich - both excellent.

      "While visiting Miami we decided to indulge in a cuban experience. We were worried because it was late, and most of the restaurants are by reservation only. Fortunately, we stumbled upon Havana 1957. In less than 10 minutes our party of 10 was warmly seated  and greeted by the coolest hostess. His name was Damian, he made sure everything in our evening was perfect. He brought us the most delicious mojitos, and the most delicious tamales we have ever tasted! After that we ordered masitas de puerco and  vaca frita. Lo was cooked to perfection. The flavor, consistency and texture of the meals was heavenly. Damian was perfect, the food and his attentive personality made our night. If you wanna indulge in a true Cuban experience you must come here. You will have an epic night guaranteed!",
      "This is a great restaurant. The food is great and the mojitos are superb. You can order Cuban tamal and won't be disappointed. The service is great and the restaurant location is privileged. However there are a few hidden fees that you are not aware of until you get the check. They charge you \"resorts fees\" whatever that means in a restaurant. We order a mojito, a sandwich and a salad and the check was over 90 bucks.",
      "Delicious, delicious, DELICIOUS! As we settled into our seats after an Art Basel event, we were offered complimentary plantain chips that were crisp and delightful. I opted in for the Hemingway Special (Signature Cocktail) and for dinner, the Pollo Havana 1957. I can see why this is such a popular and recommended menu item. The chicken was tender and slow cooked, with a beautiful gravy glaze. The rice and beans were simple and yet perfection. And, the plantains added the perfect amount of sweetness to the dish, though I hoped for more on my plate!I wanted to sit inside to get the feel of the place and as expected, it boasted authenticity. The inside of Havana 1957 is quite small, which is why the outdoor seating takes up so much of the surrounding area. It is a busy establishment! Uplifting music, delicious eats, good atmosphere, and friendly interactions is what I experienced. It was a blast!",
      "Hi Jessica! Thank you for visiting us in Havana 1957. We want you to know how much we appreciate your review. We are happy to know that you enjoyed our delicious food, friendly service, and atmosphere. We hope to welcome you again.",
      "I was told that this was the best Cuban restaurant in the city by multiple sources, and I would have to agree that this restaurant has delicious food. There's multiple locations throughout Miami Beach and reservations were easily made online. They have a 5 minute grace period for late arrivals. There's a 20% service charge. We arrived early but were still seated 15 minutes past our reservation time. Note that your entire party doesn't need to be present before being seated. Single occupant restrooms were available inside by the bar. Indoor and outdoor seating available. Credit cards accepted. We split the food family-style. I would strongly recommend getting the platter which has samplings of the chicken, ropa vieja, and lechon asado. The appetizer sampler also came with a nice array of croquettes, yucca, and other items. They give you complimentary plantain chips. They do serve alcohol and have a mojito pitcher, which is a good deal if everyone wants to drink at the table. They do have tea as well (but unfortunately not green). Service was nice if a bit scattered. As a first time visitor to Miami Beach, I was happy with the restaurant pick.",

      "I came upon this place because it had a long line and I said OMG this must be a good place to eat and Boy oh boyyyy I so happy with my choice !!! They gave us fried plantain chip for starters. I thought it was fried Yuka but it wasn't. I don't even like plantains. It was really freaking good ate the whole basket. Dinner we had the pollo 1957 meal. Which is their signature dish and it did not disappoint at all. The best part of it all was the Mexican style gravy and the rice and beans. The beans were hands down the best beans I had in my life. We also go a drink very pricey 22$ for a single shot but it's like a double shot. It's in a nice area and has a lot the chose from. I know you'll make the right choice.",
      "Dej, Thank you for your kind feedback. We are happy to hear you enjoyed your time with us. We hope to welcome you again.",
      "I dream of Ropa Vieja from Havana 1957. If you have never had Ropa Vieja, think of beef stew. The Ropa Vieja was served with perfectly cooked white rice and black beans, and was absolutely perfect-- so savory and hearty! I couldn't get enough of this dish. I also ordered the Mint Mojito, not my all time favorite, but still pretty darn good (AND STRONG!!).",
      "Thank you Christina for such a wonderful review. We are glad to know that you enjoyed our Ropa Vieja.  We look forward to welcoming you again.",
      "I had a great meal and left stuffed. I ordered the sampler, it was pretty amazing. I was not a fan of the 20% added to the tab but I assume a lot of bad tippers eat here.",
      "Hello Jim, thank you for visiting and leaving us your positive feedback, we're glad to read that you enjoyed our food. Regarding the 20%, service charge it is included in the final bill and we have a disclaimer in all of our menus advising about it; the extra tip is optional for all guests. Thanks again and we hope to see you soon!",
      "This location seems to be busy at all times, so we decided to check it out.  I had the cubano sandwich, which seems like a simple basic choice, but it didn't disappoint.  The food was so good and the drinks just as well.  Again the outside seating in Miami and the night breeze was perfect dining for two.  The hostess was great and loved her welcoming energy, wish we could've said the same for our waiter but he was MIA most of the time.  My partner was wanting hot sauce for his meal that never came and by time the waiter did check back we were nearly done.  When we were then done, took a while to get our check, to where we asked two different times to others to see if our waiter could please bring the check.  Other than the service not being up to par, would definitely recommend as a place to check out if in South Beach.",
      "Daryl,  thank you for your review and for sharing your experience at Havana 1957.",
      "The outdoor seating was really nice , we got shades and there were fans. The signature chicken was great, sauce was tasty and meat was juicy. But the beef stew was not so good, beef was too dry. And gratuity was already included ‍",

There is a \"speakeasy\" in the back of the restaurant that plays music which is a popular stop for locals and tourist to hangout and mingle.

Walking in you'll see the counter to your left where you'll order your meal. I got two al pastor tacos and a side of green rice. Tacos were great, there were pineapples in them that complimented the savory taste of the al pastor. No complaints, workers were polite and courteous. Would come again if I'm ever in town!",
      "Great spot to get some tacos and a margarita. Staff was busy but friendly and the food was awesome. Seating outside and inside. The price was pretty good as well compared to the rest of Miami. Go here and you will enjoy yourself.",
      "I was sooo excited to come back to Coyo Taco during my Miami visit. My bf and I went to Coyo twice the last time we were in Miami for a few days. Sadly, they did not have the fried fish taco when we came this time. But, we were able to try a bunch of other tacos - al pastor, pollo, beef birria, fish, and shrimp. I liked the shrimp and beef birria the most! We also got the half galloon of margarita which was tasty. For small bites, we got the esquite, chips and guac. I wasn't a big fan of the esquite but the guac was delish! Will be back again next time I come to Miami - need the fried fish taco again!",
      "Definitely my favorite taco place in Miami. Pros: the birria tacos are amazing! They provide a bunch of sauce and the flavor is absolutely divine. The meat is moist and just packed with seasoning and tenderness. I originally planned on just eating two but I ended up eating 6! They also have roasted duck tacos that are also deliciousCons: seating can get tough around mealtime. They do add cheese to the birria tacos which I do not like as a purist birria taco eater. Overall, an amazing place to get moist, delicious tacos that drip sauce all over your cheeks and make you keep going back for more.",
      "Coyo is consistent and a good place to grab a taco or three when in Wynwood.  I think they do a good job with creating the street tacos as they are often referred to.  The place can get packed but if you do not need to wait it satisfies.",
      "This stretch of Wynwood is madness on a weekend night, but particularly during the weekend I was there, when a huge art festival converged with a music week and the city was flooded with out of towners like myself. The line to coyo snaked down the block and did not move quickly, but it was one of the only options for a late night meal in the area, so I waited.While I neared the front and could make out the menu, I was disappointed to see that the lone vegetarian/pescatarian option was a sad sounding mushroom taco. The food took a while to come out and sure enough was flavorless, lacking any thoughtfulness and wasn't much helped by hot sauce.Part of what slows down the process of getting inside is the club that exists inside, past the taco eatery out front, which shares the line to get in. Smart for a club to sell tacos on the premises, but for those of us who just want to eat, coyo does not stand out for their food.",
      "Wow!   Don't let the unassuming exterior fool you.  Great service and friendly staff.  Some of the best tacos, burritos and churros we ever had!  We had the Carne Asada Alhambra Tacos, Peacado Burrito, Carne Asada Burrito and Churros.  The tortillas were home made.  An order of churros included four large churros with chocolate and caramel sauce.  Would definitely return when in the Miami area.",
      "Since I moved to south Florida 4yrs ago I've visited Wynwood countless of times. I can't believe this is my first time stopping by Coya Taco. I must say I really enjoyed my fish taco and chips and guacamole (which was freshly made). Make sure to stop by here the next time you're in the area."

The food was delicious, we highly recommend the cod croquettes, the black rice paella (Paella Negra, con la Tinta de calamari), and the turrón ice cream and torta Santiago are great. The staff was super friendly. The restaurant is 100% recommendable, it is very appropriate for a Birthday celebration or any family reunion.",

      "Great Merluza; truly awesome. Delicious Croquetas de Bacalao... Sangria is just OK. Very special bread but no butter... How can a restaurant claim to have no butter...?  However, the servers' great attitude pro-service made up for it... Will be back; hopefully they will share their butter next time... ;)",
      "The food here is excellent. It's as close to the real deal as you'll find outside of Spain. A must restaurant in the heart of Little Havana. Parking is available next to the restaurant. My only complaint is; I've been going here for a while now and the prices seemed to have skyrocketed. Maybe that's why the restaurant was a bit empty. Make sure you ask the price on the the specials, I didn't and was shocked!",
      "Excellent and classic Asturias food and spanier dishes Not pretentious but nice and good service I would definitely recommend this place",
      "I hadn't visited this restaurant in years but I remember it was good, that's why I went back. Big mistake!Food is horrible now...You couldn't tell the difference between the cod and ham croquettes; they were both a tasteless white mass. My Tarta de Santiago came decorated like a Chili's brownie, with lots of whipped cream and chocolate, all for wanting to charge $14 for it.Also, the restroom was very dirty.",

      "What a great little hole in the wall! This place is a hidden gem for Spanish food! Real Spanish food! The service is good the prices are fair! Parking can be an issue. We started with an appetizer of octopus and chorizo. The octopus was so flavorful and tender! The bread they serve warm, soft crunchy so good!My mom had the filet with mushrooms cooked to perfection perfect medium rare and the bread just complimented the sauce that it came with. It was served with the best french fries and a vegetable next! It was all delicious!The rest of us had the arroz con Mariscos quickly translated rice with seafood. It was delicious and never has more than enough food for the four of us. We took home at least another two servings."

      "Gone are the days when eating vegan meant a block of tofu covered in nutritional yeast and chalk laden soy milk. Flavors that kick open the door and yell hello in your mouth to plant and meat eaters alike. The only problem I had was I did not have enough room in my belly to try the entire menu. The Brussels had a delicious char that was accented by the subtle sweetness provided from the Sriracha styled sauce. The peanuts provided a great crunch. Textures, temperatures, and flavors all come together in a party in your mouth that can only be complained about by those who hate great food.",
      "Rogue Panda is a pretty accurate name for this establishment. It's not the most authentic Chinese food out there, but it's not bad either.I got the Dan Dan noodles and I thought they were just okay. Price was high ish $18 for the portion I received - which would have been fine if the noodles were $18 noodles. Normally, I'm not a big snob that everything has to be \"traditional\" - for instance I love Panda Express lol - but I just feel like the changes the rogue panda made to Dan Dan noodles just made it worse. Why not have crushed peanuts? Or use sesame/peanut paste? Why not make it spicier? These feel like important things for a good Dan Dan noodle and they were both missing.Anyways, I only got one dish and I'm only in town for a few days so it's hard to pass judgement on the entire restaurant. I love the concept of having plant-based Chinese food so I wish them luck, they seem like a new establishment and have room to improve!",
      "I order the dumplings and green beans. Tried the green beans and was not a fan, just because the seasoning was bland where it didn't really marinated the green beans good enough and the impossible meat had weird taste. Secondly, the dumpling were absolute No for me. The sauce was quite a shock. It tastes like buffalo sauce. Very sour and not savory at all. Did not expect those flavors from sichuan food. Flavors were all awkward to me.I'm from Los Angeles, so Szechuan food for me is more plenty of garlic, peppercorn, spicy, tangy & savory flavors.Give 3 stars for not the food at all, but the staff \"Orly\" was so helpful. He knew I didn't like the food and he did whatever he could to accommodate me. Very genuine person and knows how to provide great customer service without any questions asked!",

The dumplings are one of our most popular dishes so this is particularly surprising. Our culinary team is huddling to see what could have gone wrong and make sure it doesn't happen again.

      "This place had been on my radar for awhile, so I decided to give them a try via Door Dash one rainy evening. They're located at the Time Out Food Hall in South Beach. The menu selection (vegan Chinese) is small, but everything sounds tasty. The prices are a bit high, but at least the food came in decent-sized portions. We tried the mapo tofu, Sichuan green beans, and Rogue \"egg\" rolls. The entrees had great flavor and spiciness. The egg rolls had a nice crispness and \"meatiness\" to them. I wish they had come with some kind of dipping sauce. I wouldn't mind trying this place again next time I'm at the Time Out Food Hall.",
      "Hi Deniece! Thank you for sharing your experience with delivery so thoughtfully! So happy to hear that the flavors were on-point. Noted re: your wish for a dipping sauce; I'll see if we can add that as a delivery option. And if you come into Time Out, we can definitely give you a side of sauce, so please do come in!",
      "Excellent food! Everything is flavorful and good portions We got the slippery dumplings, dan dan noodles, and the Mapo tofu. My favorite was the dumplings! Very good flavor and the sauce was quite nice. This is a perfect option for vegans at the Time out market! It's a YES for me!",
      "Ashley, amazing, love hearing your effusive feedback. It makes our day:). Hope to see you again soon!",

      "Stopped in for lunch today at The Rogue Panda at Time Out Miami food hall and I have a feeling I will be back again very soon.If you haven't been to Time Out Food Hall in South Beach, let me tell you, it has many vegan options and many fully vegan vendors. The Rogue Panda is a fully vegan Chinese restaurant, with outstanding food, run by great people with attention to customer service as well as quality of food.The drinks came out first and the Masala Boba Tea was the perfect blend of spicy and sweet. The Lavender Lemonade was refreshing and crisp. They were poured over the boba and it worked well.The Dan Dan Noodles made with Impossible Pork ragu, bok choy, and onion crisps were quite possibly the best version of this dish I have had yet. The vegan pork ragu was authentically seasoned with just the right amount of heat. Definitely a must try.The Mapo Tofu made with Silky tofu, Impossible Pork, scallions and chili bean sauce was beyond description. The silky tofu mixed with the vegan pork ragu literally melted in my mouth and a was a taste explosion.The Slippery Dumplings were stuffed with Napa cabbage, Impossible Pork, pickled daikon and served with a spicy Sichuan sauce. Each dumpling was plump and filled with goodness and paired great with the spicy sauce. This is definitely a great dish to share with friends as a starter, and I would definitely get it again.The Rogue \"Egg\" Rolls were packed with Shiitake mushrooms, pickled veggies and served with a sweet chili sauce. Fried crispy and goldedn brown, filled with veggies and flavor. Each roll is served cut in half and perfect for sharing.The Kung Pao Brussels were Crispy brussels tossed with peanuts, scallions and Kung Pao sauce and were definitely a favorite of ours. The Brussels were crispy and fried to perfection. They were bursting with flavor and could be shared with a group as an appetizer, but so good, you might not want to share them.The Sichuan Green Beans are Charred beans with Impossible Pork, and dressed Sichuan peppercorn vinaigrette. This could easily be an entree or a shared appetizer, but either way, it was great. The authentic Chinese spice paired with the vegan pork were just so good, definitely had no complaints about this dish.The Sesame Cucumbers served with Black vinegar and sesame seeds were a light and tasty appetizer. The cucumbers were fresh and crisp and the dressing was so good. There were no cucumbers left by the end of the meal. It's a classic dish that they perfected.So satisfied with this meal and so happy with everyone I met at Time Out Market today. I am very excited to go back there and try more vendors as well as eat some of these dishes again with out having to share them. -- at The Rogue Panda...",

      "Pretty good Asian food made vegan. Not your normal and good flavor. I ordered the egg rolls, dumplings, cucumber salad (a little salty) , and noodles. Everything was good, the table's favorite were the egg rolls. Mine were the dumplings, maybe because I have never had vegan dumplings prepared like that. Also the noodles were delish. Anyway proudly supporting the community and making the journey out just to try them. Head to the Time Out Market to get your Asian vegan fix!",

      "I placed an order on line today 10/12/22 for lunch. I ordered the wrong meat. Seconds passed when I realized my mistake. I called immediately to the store at  the  Health District near Jackson hospital, and waited for 30 mins on hold and no one picked up the phone again. I sent an email to the store and I got a call from the  store manager. I explained to her what had happened and she told me that she was going to change the meat not to worry. Seconds passed and I got a call back from her telling me that the order already  left the store to be delivered but not to worry because she was going to send me immediately the same order with the corrected meat free of charge. She did keep her word and we received the order plus delicious Mexican refreshments. I want to thank the store manager for her quick response and for going far and beyond to help us. Food was delicious and fresh!!  Thank you to Vanessa who delivered the corrected order super quick.",
      "I was lured by the 4 stars this place was rated at at the time of this review.I was actually disappointed. The best part of the meal was the meat filling which is supposed to be \"barbacoa  meat\" but even though it tastes good...it is NOT authentic Mexican barbacoa.The tortilla soup was lacking the correct flavors. It feels more like a chili than a tortilla soup.The guacamole was mostly BROWN when they served it. I asked for another guacamole and it came out more green than the last one but still seemed old.The Pico de Gallo on my plate tasted decently, but it just had a \"old\" taste to it.The Street Corn was kind of dry, lacked the right flavors...I don't know. This place has all the feel of Mexican food it just falls short for me.The flavors are just... meh.",
      "I've been coming here for years, but after today, I'm done. I walked in a little after noon and I didn't smell anything. That's odd for a Mexican restaurant during the lunch hour rush. I noticed the stoves weren't on and nothing was cooking. Against my better judgment and because I was short on time, I ordered anyway. My order, a burrito, was ready before I payed. HOW!? I also ordered the tamale dip. In the past, the dip came with chips. That's also what the menu says. I did not get chips and was told the order that includes chips is a different order and costs more than what I was charged. That's BS. Plus the dip was disgusting. It was not spicy, it had no flavor, it was watery, and it had a weird color. This location has been going downhill for a long time and I'm just not giving them anymore of my money.",

      "Really wanted to like this place as our last meal in Miami but it just didn't deliver. First and foremost the service is fantastic! The employees are extremely kind and on the ball. The disappointment was with the food (for me at least). My friend ordered chicken fajitas and seemed pleased enough, except she said her skillet had more onions and peppers than chicken (like a very disproportionate amount), I myself had the chicken tacos and street corn. Unfortunately, both of the items in my order were quite bland. The corn was supposed to have a kick to it but it didn't and the corn was not the corn you'd want for street corn it was flavorless and fell flat in taste. The tacos themselves too were bland even with the onions and guacamole that come on them. In fact the most flavor I had was from the quest dip that came with my chips. While this is a quick and encompassing spot for tacos, I felt let down by the taste.",
      "Service was okay. My food came out so fast it was concerning. The food was super cold and I got an avocado rice bowl but there was more onions than rice and avocado combined. The portion is super small and not worth the price at all and the taste doesn't even make up for it. Better off going to chipotle. The location is convenient and the ambiance is nice. That's it.",
      "The real rating of tonight's visit is 5 negative stars, but because I wouldn't want it to negatively affect the GREAT ppl who work here, this review is only regarding the \"manager\" that was on duty. Unfortunately the steak on the steak salad was nowhere up to par from the steak salad I've enjoyed there for at least 4 years, I could only chew out the flavor and spit out the meat, clearly cooked hours before; nothing I had ever been served at this typically amazing establishment. I thrive off fresh food and customer service. Today was the opposite. I've never met this manager before and tonight's experience questions my desire to return. The chef who prepared my food was then cleaning tables and I just had to make a comment on the salad because the kitchen had never cooked for me old meat. She apologized and said she would make a fresh one right away. When it arrive it was perfect, just how I'm used to. But it was missing the sour cream I initially paid for ($1)  that was taken with the salad.  I approached the manger (who was sitting at the front register on a loud phone conversation) and asked for a side of sour cream (which actually should have came out with the replacement), and she asked me had I paid for it? I replied yes, with my initial purchase, and she proceeded to question me about my reason for returning the meal and insisting I need to pay for the sour cream (again). Then when the chef lady tried to explain my point of view for me, she argued WITH HER IN FRONT OF ME.  I was standing there waiting for sour cream while the \"manager\" was clarifying my reason for returning my meal  instead of getting me the item I needed to enjoy my fresh meal.   I took her \"you know what, never mind\" and I walked away. I never got the sour cream. Then I preceded to observe the manner in which she spoke to and \"managed\" the 2 chefts on duty, that usually proved amazing customer service and most importantly fresh food. I really never do this but, I felt obligated to write this review because this is a place I enjoy so much, I'd hate to see it change. .....Other wise this salsa fiesta is FIVE STARS!"

      "Great Christmas Eve experience! If you have to be out of town on Christmas Eve for work (we work in the airline industry),  there's nowhere that could possibly make you feel more welcome than Fleming's on Brickell.The food was amazing - those Fleming's potatoes should be put in a potato hall of fame - but it was the service that was most remarkable.From the moment we walked in the door (our entire flight crew of 6), we were greeted warmly and enthusiastically.We couldn't have been luckier than to have Blanca as our server - just the right amount of humor and wit - I'd go back just for her!Everything our crew ordered - Fleming's potatoes, Brussels sprouts, sautéed mushrooms, onion rings, asparagus, filet mignon, salmon, lobster, shrimp diablo - was flawlessly prepared and amazing.As stuffed as we were after dinner, Blanca somehow managed to get us to order desserts - carrot cake, cheesecake, chocolate gooey butter cake, and creme brule - and we wolfed down every bite - they were simply amazing.Thank you Fleming's and Blanca, for making us feel cared for and loved as we  spend the Christmas holiday on the road.",
      "This was a very strong 4. Really a great overall experience. The staff was attentive and friendly. Good interaction and waitress was helpful with the menu. Food. Absolute star. My recent experience at steakhouses has been that the steaks haven't stood out. This was not the case here. I ordered the strip medium rare and it was cooked perfectly. It was a large cut and the salty peppery char was amazing. I've eaten at a lot of steakhouses and this strip was as good as any. I would 100% order this steak again. A few more thoughts on food...Onion rings- Insanely good. Huge chunks that were crispy and the sauce on the side was like a sriracha aioli on steroids. Asparagus- usually bland at most steakhouses these were seasoned well but not overall salted or cooked. Just right. Calamari- this was really good as the added peppers and onions elevated the dish. Would order this and all of the items again. Red Wine- ordered a bottle of Quilt. A Napa Cab on the recommendation of the waitress and it was a perfect pairing with the meal. Enjoyed the experience and would recommend it and go back again.",
      "First off... yesss!!! First time coming to a Flemings restaurant and they didn't miss. When we arrived for our reservation, the kind hostess gave us options for seats which was nice. It wasn't too busy and she was very accommodating. Andy was our server and was a gem. He explained the menu well and even brought a few glasses of brut to celebrate my recent milestone. Very kind! The manager came and checked on us and the rest of the staff was also on point. The location is right in downtown Brickell - right next to my office. I can see this being a popular location for corporate patrons in the area. I'm not sure about parking options but it didn't appear to be many - although there seemed to be a valet option around the corner. Not sure if this is available to Fleming's patrons or not.The food and server were equally stand out. We started with the calamari to share and it came with warm bread and two types of gourmet butters. Delicious! Next we're the steaks, which were cooked to perfection, the Brussel sprouts with bacon, and Mac and cheese. Everything was a winner!I'd recommending this Flemings location to anyone in the Brickell area looking for good food, good service, and an awesome experience.",
      "Third time coming to Fleming's here in Miami and I must say it does not disappoint. Every time we crave steak we end up at Fleming's. The staff and the service is awesome, the ambiance is very Miami and the steaks keep us coming back! Can't wait till we return.",
      "Stopped by Fleming's once again! Another fantastic and enjoyable dinner. We had a glass of wine and this steak for 2 with the Cesar salad, we love to keep it simple. Never disappoints. Thank you Fleming's for an amazing dinner and over the top service.",
      "Let's start off by saying I love Fleming's! I've been to the one in New Jersey and other locations. This was a great experience. Our server was Pedro and he was fantastic, he was kind and went above and beyond in order for us to have the best experience. We started off with the shrimp cocktail which was fresh and delicious. Their bread was warm and the pumpkin spiced butter was out of this world. For the main course we had the New York strip and the Prime Dry-Aged Ribeye which were both cooked to perfection. I can't say this enough I love Fleming's and the ambiance to this location is very hip and fun! can't wait to return and hope you're lucky enough to have Pedro as your server!",
      "Nice, quality place to dine anytime. They have a couple private rooms, so this is a go to when I need to coordinate corporate lunches and dinners. Their service and food are excellent.",
      "In my humble opinion, this is the best chain steak house. I went here after a sporting event, we were seated right away, and the service was incredible. Our server, Julio was world class and made sure we were well taken care of. I had the filet mignon and it was charred on top and tender inside. A perfectly cooked steak. The server was able to suggest a wine that paired perfect with my meal and the mash potatoes I had with the steak was just the right consistency. We sat outside on a busy night and took advantage of the December Miami weather. I shared a creme brûlée with my girlfriend and it was incredible. I should of mentioned before that they make their butter in house. Great restaurant, and I will be back.",
      "This place is simply amazing! The food, ambience and service were impeccable! I treated my daughter for her 10th birthday and we truly enjoyed everything with the exception of the area where they sat us at which is considered the \"lounge area\" not sure why when we had reservations made prior, It didn't feel like we were apart of the main dining area. My server was awesome and attentive. We had the CERTIFIED ANGUS BEEF RIBEYE $55 with JUMBO LUMP CRAB MEAT over the top ($15 extra), a side order of CHIPOTLE CHEDDAR MAC & CHEESE $14 and my daughter had the FILET MIGNON and STEAK FRIES $25 from the children's menu along with the Flemings salad and cheesecake for dessert and it was cooked to perfection, she really enjoyed it. Parking: They have a parking garage along side the restaurant, I paid $10 for approximately 2/3 hours, not bad.",
      "Fleming's was wonderful! We started things off with salads - I ordered the Wedge, smothered in Bleu and other yummy toppings. We then were brought our main courses, various steaks, onion rings, Mac & cheese, Fleming's potatoes, and sautéed mushrooms. Delicious!! Our steaks: Prime Dry-Aged Ribeye and the Prime New York Strip. Our waitress asked if we were celebrating any occasion and after revealing that we were celebrating a birthday, they offered us a dessert of our choosing on the house! The birthday boy picked the Chocolate Gooey Butter Cake for dessert!  yummmmyyyy!I highly recommend getting a reservation, although they did not seem overly busy.  Definitely snag a glass of Catena Malbec  it paired well with the New York Strip.",
      "I'd like to start by saying that this place is amazing! and beautifully decorated as you'd expect from a five star restaurant. Personnel is very friendly and as expected can count of waiter, waitress or in our case bartenders will manage you dining experience to perfection.We didn't have reservations and it being Friday evening there wasn't any available seating so we accepted to sit at the bar. They have a great wine selection and was happy that bartender let us try a couple of different wines before making our selection to a bottle of Belle & Goss Pinot Noir.I ordered the 12 oz. aged deep rubbed ribeye and two sides of Brussels sprouts Flemings potatoes that was very delicious. For dessert we shared the carrot cake and it was amazing. Overall left restaurant happy after an amazing meal. Hope to be back at this place soon.",

They have very innovative cocktails as well.I would say priced accordingly for your typical Miami Steakhouse/ fine dining experience. Highlights:I had the lobster bisque ( on the thicker side, chunks of lobster on the inside, just a bit salty). The CRAB CAKES were Perfect! ( recommend ) The lobster Mac and cheese was also one of my favorites ( creamy and cheesy ). SO SO: Service was ok, but the food took long to arrive and the waiter took long to greet and bring drinks.Steak was good but had a little too much fat for my liking. But it was eatable ( was also cooked perfect ). The lobsters were very small for price... ( taste was ok ) MUST GET:For dessert you can't miss with the creme brûlée. For the most part it was good experience, food was good. Well recommended for any occasion or simply a night out on the town."

      "Seaspice was amazing. It's a fantastic restaurant with a great view right on the Miami River. If you don't right you can catch the live music as the sun sets, and the restaurant transforms to a lounge. Totally worth coming Parking is tricky, and if you're not paying attention you might miss it as you drive by. But it's a gem worth coming back to.",
      "Seaspice is known to Miami locals as a very high end resturant, frequented by celebrities.  I have no idea why.  The service is pretty awful.  The drink runners are horrible.  It takes about 30 minutes for just a drink to be brought out to you.  The food is mediocre.  It is definitely NOT worth the price, which is very expensive.  I am giving two stars because the view is amazing.  Seaspice is right on the water and has a gorgeous ambiance.  You can watch yachts drive by and some will even pull up and park.  The other star is for the tres leches.  This dessert was AMAZING, I would go back just to eat it again.  But otherwise, Seaspice is nothing special.  Save your money.",
      "A place that tries to be high end but fails to deliver.Service ? Mediocre Food ? Below parFirst thing when you check in is they tell you that you have a 2 hr max(tacky)",
      "I read this was one of the best patio dining AND a hot spot for celebrities in Miami, so I had to go check it out on our recent travels to this area...Initially I was worried about our luggage situation, as we had to carry our luggage to the restaurant since this was our last stop in Miami. However, they were very accommodating, and let us store some of our stuff in the closet, and we kept the big luggage with us, near our table.As expected, the patio scene was spectacular...city skyline and seaside views, with plenty of yachts passing by! The place indeed had that chic celebrity vibe...truly FAB! Loved the music overhead as well. Somehow, I expected some snobbiness...but not at all. Service was great!Then the food. OMFG...I've had some amazing foods lately, but this takes the cake. Even the complimentary bread was amazing (and unique)! My husband ordered this Wagyu Burger, and I chose this Ragu Pappardelle ( THE best Ragu Pappardelle I've ever had...EVER. ). Then this Pavola dessert...again, just beyond delish. Truly, this was foods for the celebrities.Honestly, I'm shocked at how low the rating is for this place. I assume that if the service isn't top notch, it would probably piss some folks off. The pricing was on the outlandish side...with even lunch entrees starting at around 40. There was even an appetizer item priced at around 70 bucks! Luckily, like I said, I felt that the foods and the service (and especially the spectacular ambiance) made up for it. There was this big yacht parked right near us, which somewhat blocked some of the views from the left. Still, we got our eyeful of seaside/yachtside views.In any case, this was a great way to end our trip in Miami.",
      "Went here with a group of girlfriends for brunch and everything was delicious, they were super accommodating as well.I had the froze , a cucumber and gin cocktail and 2 grey goose and sodas and all were fantastic.As a table we split the fresh fish and a couple sides and it was delicious. Also love the free bread It is definitely on the pricier side overall tbh but great for a fun \"fancy\" brunch",
      "Came here for Miami spice and although we spent more than we thought we would, we had a good time. Everything was delicious. The kale Caesar had pecans and Granny Smith apple slices, never had a Caesar like this but it was a nice change! The Shrimp Pesto Whole Wheat Spaghetti was my favorite, even though I'm not the biggest fan of pesto. The burger was good too just a little messy from the truffle aioli. The chocolate cremoso and tres leches was very good but I'd go with the cremoso for the cocoa nib crumble, yum! All in all, I think it's overpriced and I probably won't come here again because of that. The cheapest bottle of Chardonnay was $75 and most drinks were $20. I only came here for Miami spice and still spent almost $200.",
      "Given we still have Miami Spice going on until the end of the month we decided to try out the lunch menu @ Seaspice gorgeous location on the Miami River, sitting outdoor is really relaxing, so beautiful to watch the boats go by, really lovely To start we had the Comte' Cheese Soufflé, I have to admit this was a bit disappointing, it really did not have the texture of a real soufflé  but then............ the Shrimp Pesto Whole Wheat Spaghetti and the Pan-Seared Chilean Seabass were really good as dessert, both the Tres Leches and the Chocolate Cremoso were yummy Try it out before Miami Spice ends, you can check out the Miami Spice Menus on miamiandthebeaches.com@seaspicemia",
      "First time for me at Seaspice, it is located on the banks of the Miami River it is a gem that you should not miss. Sit outside in the courtyard enjoy your food and a drinks while watching the boats go by, just beautiful We had the Miami Spice lunch which has a very affordable fix price 3 course menu for $ 28, unfortunately this will end soon, nevertheless, I would defiantly go back again for sureRegarding the Miami Spice menu only one observation, they should have had more than one choice for the Entrees without the extra charge, right now you have 4 choices and 3 of these have extra charge on it, not really fair given that you are promoting the Spice menu, you should have at least two or three choices included in the price and one or two with the extra charge We had had Prince Edward Island Mussels, Grilled, the Grilled Faroe Island Salmon and the Profiteroles and Peaches and Cream. My favorite where the Mussels, the garlic pizza bread they brought for the table was absolutely delicious, the Salmon was good too. I had the Peaches for dessert and it was ok, not really my thing, my friend said the Profiteroles were great, next time I will not opt for the healthy dessert We enjoyed all with a good Albariño wine, our experience was made especially enjoyable by our waiter Fabrizio, he was really great ! Thank you Fabrizio @seaspicemia",
      "Bad first impression. Its not a nice feeling to feel like you have to beg to spend your money at a restaurant. Every year I look forward to Miami Spice. It's a great way to try out various restaurants and a unique spread of menu options. Seaspice was on my radar and happened to be one of the participating restaurants offering the Miami Spice menu. I contacted the restaurant in advance and made a reservation for 3:30p for a party of four. My mom who is from out of town was excited to join us for lunch. I advised the restaurant we were doing the Miami Spice menu. The restaurant made it clear that they charge $50pp for No Shows. At 3:15pm, we arrived for our reservation. The hostess Karin greeted us, and advised us that they were running behind on the reservations and because of this they will not be able to offer the Miami Spice menu. Only the a la-carte menu will be offered. This was a bit upsetting because we drove almost an hour to get there and the restaurant is refusing to offer the Miami Spice promotion. Our natural instinct was to just say forget it we will go somewhere else. I mean, at the end of the day who wants to beg to spend their money? It's absurd. If the restaurant is offering a promotional menu and because to no fault of our own they are running behind why should we be penalized?My Mom looked so bummed out. Because she was so excited to try this place. I decided to walk back in and ask for a Manager. The Manager took 20min to come out. When he finally did come over, he introduced himself as Collin. I explained to him what was going on and it seemed as though he wasn't aware that the hostesses were turning Miami Spice customers away. He decided to make it right and advised Karin to honor the Miami Spice menu. Impressive! Things were turning around. Besides the encounter at the hostess stand, the restaurant is beautiful. It is situated on Miami's waterfront were you can view the million dollar yachts passing by. They also have docks for those interested in docking and dining. You can view the downtown city skyline which I am sure looks amazing at night.The food was excellent. The Miami Spice menu offered a three course lunch for $28. You have the choice of a starter (Kale Salad, Cheese Souffle, or White Gazpacho). A choice of entrees (Seabass, Chicken Breast, Shrimp Pesto Pasta, Wagyu Burger, or Plant Bowl). And a choice of dessert (Tres Leches or Chocolate Cremoso). They also offer the option to add a Glass of wine for and additional $12. I ordered the Comte Cheese Souffle, the Green Circle Farms Chicken Breast, and the Tres Leches. The others in my party ordered the Kale Salad, Gazpacho, and Seabass. For starters, My favorites were the Kale Caesar Salad and Cheese Souffle. The Kale Caesar had a mix of shredded Granny Smith apples, pecans and a creamy Caesar dressing. The cheese Souffle was like a fluffy egg Souffle with a cream parmesan sauce and tomato chutney. Delicious!For entrees, both the Seabass and Chicken breast were amazing. The Chicken breast was tender and juicy, served on top of a creamy polenta and topped with corn, peas, and mushrooms. The seabass was seared nicely to give a nice crunch on the outside, while perfectly flaky and moist on the inside. It was served with stewed garbanzo, Swiss chard, and smoked potato. For desserts, we all had Tres Leches. It was served in a small Mason jar topped with 3 milks, and berries. Perfect way to end the meal. The portions are not large but it is filling. The flavors are fresh and very well balanced. The food presentation was notable. The Watermelon Tequila drink was delightful and refreshing. The froze was also a big hit. The cocktails were presented well and created perfectly. We enjoyed everything. Our waiter, Austin was very friendly. He made great recommendations and was very attentive.An 18% gratuity was added to the tab. There are lots of street parking accessible. In the end, the food was great. Ambience was amazing. The hostesses can use additional customer service training and learn to use better judgment to improve the customers experience. There was no need to escalate the matters to a manager. It could have been handled properly by showing empathy, apologizing, and finding a solution to the problem.",
      "Hi Kim,Thank you for dining with us and leaving a detailed review. It has been forwarded to our management team. Our apologies for the confusion at the door.  Glad to hear Collin accommodated you and your experience was turned around.  We are happy to see your great feedback regarding the food, cocktails, and Austin’s Service.  Hopefully you will join us again in the near future!",
      "This is my second time going to sea spice & I normally love it as the first time. I never leave bad reviews But this second time MY PHONE WAS STOLEN AND SECURITIES DID NOThing about it. Instead we're trying to blame me for the situation. I'm not drunk nor was drunk. I walked in with 2 phone and walked out with 1.We came as my friend USUALLY does and this is how they treated us  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME. I thought it was 5 star so nothing could go wrong. With a security right next to our table my phone STILLL got stolen. It was on the table. And to whoever has the time to steal phones is just sad imagine what else they can steal... I wil ask to review cameras but with the way I was treated when I let them know I lost my phone I doubt they will be helpful but I'll let every platform form of review know that they steal phones here. I know the exact time frame as well so they wouldn't even have to look much at the cameras. Let's see. BTW I BEEN HOME SICK AFTER EATING THESE OYSTERS I COULDNT Even celebrate my baby's birthday w him.",
      "Came here for my birthday dinner with my boyfriend for a 7:15 reservation (we called in advance for an outdoor seat dock side) we waited about ten minutes after our arrival for our table to be ready at the bar, the short wait was definitely worth it. Started with an aperol spritz at the bar then ordered octopus and gazpacho to start. Octopus portion was good but the olive oil tasted burnt since it came out on a sizzling hot cast iron looking skillet (its very easy to overcook octopus, please just bring a regular plate next time.) I also had the whole main lobster. Extremely delicious large portion of perfectly cooked and seasoned lobster, bravo. My boyfriend had the truffle coated Chilean sea bass and he absolutely loved it. Vibe: 5/5 this place definitely is a scene but not overwhelmingly pretentious or obnoxious. Absolutely loved the music as well. Service:3/5 A bit slow, our server was very attentive when we were able to get his attention but we had to always wave him down. Food: 4/5 everything was honestly pretty good (octopus could've had a bit more attention to detail)",
      "Hi Liz,Thank you for celebrating your birthday with us!  We are so happy to hear you had a great experience and enjoyed the food.  Your feedback regarding the octopus has been sent to our chef. We look forward to seeing you again soon!"

      "Overall: Amazing food. We will definitely be back! The Great: - Biscetta allá Fiorantina. We got the serving for 2. Incredible. - Tiramisu OMG - get it. - Tableside Caesar - Very nice server - Ben - Foccacia bread The good: - Meatball App - The wine cellar and steak presentation as you walk in is a nice touch General feedback: - Dimming the lights a bit more would give it some real ambiance and a homier feel  - They JUST opened so cut the staff some slack. I've been on a team opening a restaurant before and it's so hard. They did great! - Good location - easy access with ample parking. A local steakhouse is just what the neighborhood needs - The staff was really sweet and everyone was really working hard all night.",
      "Went here for a birthday dinner. They have a great menu with all sorts of selections.  Our waiter was pushy and rude.  We ordered a NY Strip, Branzino, Pasta Bolonaize, Filet Minan, truffle fries and salad.  The steaks were ordered medium well done.  All the food was good except the steaks.  They kept bringing back the steaks rare and the waiter was angry with nasty comments toward us.  If you go here avoid this guy.  We told the mgr who seemed surprised.",
      "The staff and Marco was amazing! The food, absolutely Devine, the portion the flavor, the attention to detail were all perfection. Thank you for making my husband's 40th bday so memorable.",
      "Hello my name is Nick. Of course I'm from New York. I usually don't write reviews specially bad ones we got to this nice restaurant very gorgeous inside. The bread was delicious. I have to say the first course was a pasta dish we split. It had a Bolognese sauce on it it was served hot and good. Little did I know that was the highlight of a dinner. My steak came out first they cut it up which I wasn't crazy about but it was cold. my friends ordered a veal dish a special order. They accommodated them but the dish also was ice cold. The dish presentation was very nice but it being cold was definitely a problem. I must mention the sides to twice cook baked potato was a baked potato not twice cooked. The cream spinach was nice fresh baby spinach sautéed with melted cheese on top. The menu, said cream of spinach. I do wish they would get their act together, and I would even consider trying it again. The Decour is very elegant. It was Christmas Eve. We got there at 6:15 and it wasn't that busy. There was no excuse for the cold food. I must say I was very disappointed. My name is nick hogan.",
      "Nice bar.  Quality food.   Good service    Except bartender Angie.  Good wine and liquor selection",
      "Great new restaurant. Not crowded yet. We got frutti dimare and branzino, both dishes were excellent. I especially liked that unlike many other places they go easy on a salt. Highly recommend!",
      "Rippoff stupid place out of place Does not belong among working class neighborhood Just close down and go to Ball Harbor",
      "Ridiculous prices for a basic Italian restaurant It will never make it in NMB Will not bring lunch customers at this prices Dinner customers will go to a well known reliable restaurant",
      "My boyfriend and I had been waiting for what felt like an eternity for this place to open because we love Frank so we had to check out a place named after his iconic song. Just like his song, our experience was great! The place feels intimate and has a great ambiance for a date night. The food was also incredible! Yet, the best part was the service. Our server Andrea was so sweet and helpful the entire night. I highly recommend!",
      "One of the most authentic Italian restaurants I've ever eaten at!  First rate and class-  Look forward to having many more meals at My Way!  Thanks to the incredible staff for an incredible evening.",
      "Perfect place for date night! The food was amazing and the staff very friendly and attentive. Can not go wrong with the BURRATA CAPRESE for starter and my favorite the FILETTO DI MANZO! So many tasty options can't wait to go back next time I am in town!"

      "Stumbled in this place after deciding we are not having McDonald's for Christmas Eve dinner. This was one of the only restaurants open and oh boy are we glad we found them, It's Italian food specifically from the Naples region. They give you a basket of house made bread to begin and I honestly could just eat a portion of that. We started with the beef carpaccio and had the special of the day which was a crab ravioli and got a pizza as well. Everything was delicious! Our server was so friendly , knowledgeable and Italian that's how you know this place is legit haha.So glad we found this place looking forward to trying more stuff on their menu!",
      "Wanted to try this new location of the renowned O'munaciello. We'll known for its award winning pizzas and great Italian cuisine. The new location is nicely decorated and it is actually big. Lots of room inside and plenty tables. As usual service is impeccable and very friendly. This time I wanted to try something different so I went with one of their daily specials which was the mushroom risotto .... delicious.! Definitely worth ordering. Also had the Vesuvio pizza with the dark dough which makes it even better. Vesuvio in my opinion is one of their best.Just drop whatever you are doing and come eat here. Yes... it is good.",
      "some of the best pizza I have had in a long time.  and the meatballs were amazing   hostess and staff were great. smiling and great service.  my now weekly pizza place ! highly recommended to all",
      "Just ok nothing special. I ordered the Margherita Dop Pizza and I think it was over priced for what you get. Probably wont be back.",
      "This cute little spot on Coral Way was a delight for dinner! Friendly staff, great pizza, and a casual yet refined atmosphere. My boyfriend and I went for a Sunday night dinner and ordered the two pizzas shown below. The Las Vegas pizza (Not posted online) and the Margherita Pizza. The Las Vegas pizza has sausage, peppers, mushrooms, and cherry tomatoes. It was tasty. Nothing out of this world, but good. My boyfriend and I agreed that the Margherita Pizza was fantastic! The tomato sauce was on the sweeter side. The dough was soft and had a fresh flavor. We couldn't stop eating until all the crust was gone. Every so often, you would get a bite of the fresh mozzarella, which made the experience even better. Overall, between the welcoming staff, and the tasty pizza, I would recommend this restaurant. I will be coming back and trying more of their pizza options soon!",
      "My favorite margarita pizza in town.   Service was excellent too.  Highly recommend if you're looking for napolitan style pizza margarita with DOP mozzarella!",
      "I'm a huge fan of the original location in MiMo so I was super excited that they opened up this location 5 minutes from me! I lived in Italy years ago, and Munaciello is the closest I've gotten to authentic pizza in Miami. I can see why it was named the 5th best pizzeria in the US!Service was superb - Ernesto and all the staff were so friendly! They just opened and we were given complimentary bites and Prosecco to enjoy. Such a nice touch and much appreciated.We got the Vegetariana and Vesuvio pizzas to share between the two of us -- both were delicious and we had enough leftover to take home.This is definitely going to be my go-to pizza place now that it's in my neighborhood!!",
      "We have been to their location on Biscayne Blvd and hoped the food was just as good, we were pleasantly surprised, this is a small restaurant where they make you feel like you're at home. The Bucatini Cacio e Pepe was exceptional and so was the Tagliatini Al Ragú. Don't miss out on this great place before it's discovered and you'll have to beg  for a table.",
      "Newly opened location. We'd been to their other restaurant and loved the food. You assume it's going to be great and authentic when you're surrounded by both staff and patrons speaking Italian. And it is. This was a more formal but still casual interior - and the food was excellent. True Italian food made by Italians. Award winning pizza, pasta tdf - with some very interesting but simple sauces. House salad also excelled. Bread basket contained their own bread swirled with charcoal. Unique and delicious dipped in their incredible EVOO and balsamic. Didn't have room for dessert, sadly.Server (owner?) was very attentive and professional. Reservations online were via google assistant - first time with this and it was easy. Will definitely return.",

I'd recommend this place only because of Marlon. The food was good too, but Marlon exceeded our expectations. Whatever he is getting paid, he deserves a raise! I would come back just for him.

The restaurant offers an ample seating space inside and out.Breakfast offers conservative choices for anybody to choose something they like. A Yelp check in gets you a house mimosa or glass of wine that's truly dissapointing but hey, it's free.What I enjoy most about The Social Club is their outdoor seating as you can people watch and feel Miami's Collins Ave.",
      "The staff was overwhelmingly friendly and welcoming! The hostess seated us quickly and the server checked on us frequently throughout our dining experience. The music playlist and the flowers were such a beautiful ambiance. We went in December and sat outside and it was beautiful out! The food presentation was immaculate. If you come here you must have the fancy French toast as it melts in your mouth with the dipped chocolate truffle and Nutella. The eggs Benedict were mid at best as the eggs were a bit too runny, but the short rib was cooked to perfection. Thank you to Leo for a great dining experience.",
      "We ate here as an extended family with adults and children.  It was a huge success which is amazing in that we had both adult and child picky eaters.  They also have a kids' menu which was great.  We had multiple different entrees - chicken, steak, and fish.  All were tasty.  The kids liked their meals as well.Our service was good as well.  We did sit inside, and we did make a reservation.  The restaurant is tricky to get in to initially but they do have valet parking which is handy given the location of the restaurant.The only thing that we both liked and didn't like was the parade of people going to and from the hotel.  It provided some entertaining people watching but it also took away from the dining experience itself.",

He let us know that we could buy one mimosa and if we liked it upgrade then. Great server and good food. Would recommend",
      "We socialized at the social club and that's about it! We had high hopes for this establishment after reading reviews but I can say it was a miss for us. I think the biggest issue we had was the Mediterranean Flatbread my friend ordered. It was NOT what was described in the menu. (See pics) that was the biggest joke of this visit. The fact that they literally took some bread and threw vegetables on top without it even being heated says a lot. After, complaining the \"chef\" was brought out and acted as if he didn't understand what the issue was. If tools is forever to get a manager to even come and assist us. She claimed to have been in meetings (it's Labor Day) we didn't really believe it, but I guess. She finally came over and we explained our concern with the flatbread, which she then retrieved the menu to compare the description to what was brought out only to find that it was in fact NOT was described. I'm assuming she had to see for herself. My friend didn't end up eating or paying for the flatbread and was never really apologized to. Needless to say we won't be back. I hope if you do visit you have a better experience than we did.",
      "Eh, I'm not sure what the hype is with The Social. The best part about our breakfast was the ricotta donuts. Those are worth ordering! The veggie omelet and the breakfast sandwich were seriously lacking in flavor. I felt like I could have made a better breakfast at home. I don't think it's worth going when there are so many other great restaurants in Miami.",
      "A brief walk from the nearby Hotel Confidante on a pleasant Thursday evening brought our party of three to The Social Club recently. We were seated outside, where a warm breeze and the Miami Beach views greeted us. The small plates really spoke to us, so we asked for the following for the table:Cheese + Charcuterie - A diverse board containing three or four delicious cheeses, a selection of nuts, olives, honeycomb, a few cured meats (salami, prosciutto) as well as some thin sliced ham and crispy bread slices, this dish had something for everyone. Argentinian prawn and Gulf shrimp - Served in a rich and decidedly spicy cognac based sauce, this was a shrimp lover's delight. The large prawn yielded tender, delicious meat, as did the more modestly sized shrimp. Definitely sop up that sauce!Empanadas - The selection of four left our group fighting over the last one. Crispy exteriors yielded warm, rich, delicious fillings of chicken and peppers, beef and tomato, tomato caprese, and chorizo and peppers, A trio of sauces including a garlic aioli, chimichurri, and aji chili really amped up the flavor of this dish. Highly recommended. Golden reverse Oreo - We couldn't resist a selection from the dessert menu, and this one was a winner. Featuring a vanilla cookie, chocolate, and a cream cheese ganache, it was delicious without being overly sweet. A great capper to a delicious meal. This place was definitely a winner!"

      "I was hand picked with 19 other artist to come to Miami for Art Basel. Our group dinner was here & the experience was nice. Sitting outside where there's a pool along with a DJ playing music for an event, the food made everything even better.First Course: Greek Salad, Lamb Gyro, Meze Dip, Flaming Cheese Saganaki, DolmadesSecond Course: Mousaka FusionDessert: Nutella Baklava(There some dishes missing, which includes things on the vegan + vegetarian end)I tried everything from the first course. My favorite were the Dolmades, I couldn't get enough of it. I wanted the recipe on the spot. The flaming cheese stole the show as the flame took place as the skillets were sat down. From all of the options, I knew I need to chill because huge chunked slices of potatoes were served as well that went great with the lamb. I wanted to make room for everything else, like the Mousaka Fusion. It was an eggplant lasagna, I liked it. Then we got to the finish line with the baklava. The Nutella was definitely on deck with the dessert. You get plenty of it in every bite. On top of that, I ordered a Revenge of the Spartans from the Greek Cocktails section of the menu: Mastiha tequila, lime juice, watermelon & basil. Tequila AND watermelon, that's an automatic, great drink. Service was incredible. Wait wasn't long for anything. View was great. Enjoyed the evening with beautiful people. Food always makes things even better, especially good food.",
      "Ambiance is nice especially with live music.Food is soso but location location ideal for first time visitors.",
      "When traveling I find I often wear some type of shirt that signifies Wisconsin.  Time and again people across the country see the shirt and a conversation ensues.  While in Miami Beach I was wearing said Wisconsin shirt and a woman from my home state told me I had to try Santorini's happy hour.  We were told three small plates would fill us up at half the price of a dinner.Oddly enough we found ourselves exploring near Santorini's during happy hour and decided to stop in.  So very glad we decided to stop.  I had the Caesar salad, pork sandwich and fries while my wife had the hummus, olives & feta and chicken tzatziki.  Pair that with a mai tai and pina colada and we had a pretty good sampling.Each small plate and drink was shareable and was only between $5 - $7.    The service was excellent as was the food.  We were definitely not steered wrong with the suggestion to stop here for happy hour.The only unusual thing is that the restaurant is within the hotel and the table area surrounds the swimming pool.  If I was a hotel guest it'd be awkward to me to swim with people dining so close. We weren't splashed and the pool didn't dampen our experience any.",
      "Been coming for years.  There is perhaps no better happy hour in South Pointe SoBe.  Authentic flavors and high quality of food.  Must order the calamari and lamb gyro; thank me later.",
      "This spot is good, however I think they they are a bit overhyped with the food not exactly the same as authentic Greek food.First of all, this is located as a part of the Hilton hotel by South Beach. It has an outdoor pool for hotel guests only, which can be pretty awkward when people are swimming, and you are eating.I grabbed a mango daiquiri which was excellent. The mango juice was really pure and sweet, and the blended ice was even and soft.The fried calamari was pretty good with a tartar sauce and a marinara sauce.The lamb gyro was also good with decent meat quality.We got a few happy hour burger bites which are very ok. Not much flavor and incredibly small.The falafel is not worth it. You pay for just 3 small falafel balls on a plate.The trio dip with pita is also not that great. The babaganoush did not taste fresh and was missing that tahini flavor. It was also slightly under seasoned and could have used just a pinch of salt.  The pita is also hard like a giant chip. I would have preferred smaller pieces of pita in this case, otherwise a big piece of soft pita would have been better.Overall just an ok place.",
      "Wow! Can we talk about amazing food AND amazing service?! Santorini By Georgios took my breath away with just the most tasty menu and very kind staff. They are a Mediterranean/ Greek restaurant tucked away in the most stunning way on the southern edge of Miami Beach. What's amazing is you can find very affordable parking in the parking lot directly South of the restaurant. To get a great taste and sample of their menu options I'd suggest heading over for Happy Hour where you can try many items. I absolutely suggest trying the spanakopita, key west grilled shrimp and the delectable cheese platter! Such a great restaurant, will definitely be returning soon!",
      "This restaurant was in our hotel so we stopped by for a quick bite to eat. Service was really good and so was the food. Portions were huge. My lamb gyro came with fries and a huge Greek salad.  I had a glass of Riesling and it was not good, prob the worst I've had. . The restaurant seating is around the pool and I enjoyed sitting there and people watching.",
      "This Greek restaurant offers a wonderful location with both indoor and outdoor seating options. A modern clean open vibe and great service is very welcoming.This restaurant offers a full bar and a wide variety of Greek favorites and other options for those not quite so daring! The seafood was very fresh and the gyros platter was absolutely out of this world - garlic lovers will be in seventh heaven!Check out this restaurant if you have a craving for some really great Greek food.",
      "This place is great! Atmosphere is inviting and the staff is welcoming. They know what they're doing and what they're talking about. You can tell making the customers happy is their main priority because the staff truly cares about your experience. I always want to give my compliments to the chef! The food is always fantastic no matter what I order; I am always delighted with my meal! Always a pleasure to see Georgio :)",
      "This a cute place in Miami. We came here to celebrate my friend's birthday.  I started with a jumbo shrimp appetizer (not pictured because I dug right in!). It was delicious and cocktail sauce was perfect for dipping. I ended up ordering the chicken woodfire pizza. It was delicious. The goat cheese tasted fresh, actually the entire pizza tasted fresh to order. The staff brought out dessert and sang Happy Birthday to my friend. The drinks tasted amazing and the entire experience was well worth it. If in Miami, definitely check this place out!"

There are 2 nooks hidden in each corner of the restaurant if you like to be hidden away while you eat. I can't wait to go back!",
      "We stumbled upon this place by accident and I am so happy we did.  The food l. The ambiance, the service was top notch.  The Asian Salad was sooooo good. Light yet complex.  I got the fried tofu and it was delish.  The outside was crunchy and the inside was soft and creamy.  The peanut sauce complimented it very well.  For my main meal I got the combo that had fried rice topped with a fried egg, the beef and the curry chicken.  They used breast in the curry and I found it a bit dry but that amazing curry sauce made up for it.  The service was top notch. Looking forward to my return trip.",
      "Quaint little restaurant near the heat arena. First time eating Indonesian food and it was fantastic!! Flavors upon flavors.  I had the beef and my friend had the grouper. The salad appetizer was delicious. If you are in the area, stop by and you won't be disappointed!",
      "I would call this place Southeast Asian light. It definitely has Indonesian specialties like Rijsttafel and Beef Rendang, but it also caters to Miami tastes for general Asian fare like Egg Rolls and Shrimp Shumai (which I'm positive people in Indonesia enjoy). Whatever it takes to make it in this town, right?I had a Miami book fair event at the college and was happy to pop in and out on 30 minutes with a satisfying meal of deliciously complex beef rendang. For the uninitiated, it's tender beef chunks seasoned with coconut and citrus with a slightly spicy kick. I'm grateful this place exists and it offers something different when it's easy to be drowned out by the more facile run-of-the-mill Chinese and Japanese joints. Also it came with a big ginger sesame salad which made me feel less guilty about the rich beef meal. To top off the evening I was serenaded by a dancing Santa figurine jamming to jingle bells. My first Xmas spirit was experience of the season.",
      "This place transported me back to when I lived in Asia. From the hospitality to the decor, it doesn't feel like Miami. The food was also delicious. I live in Orlando and we don't have any Indonesian restaurants and this place is worth a stop if I'm in Miami.",
      "Delicious food and exceptional service! The staff was friendly and very welcoming. I live in Orlando and Miami might be the closest place that has an Indonesian restaurant and it's worth the visit when I'm in Miami!We got the gado gado, rendang, and lontong cap gomeh. All were so flavorful and delicious. I'd like to go back and try their laksa and other noodle dishes!",
      "Nice little jewel in downtown. Small place with very good food and service. Very recommended. Only bad thing at the end your clothes will smell like food, need better ventilation but not a deal breaker. Visit this restaurant.",
      "Bali cafe restaurant in Downtown been coming here for over 16 years always so good Indonesian",
      "My friend recommended this place and said that the food was delicious and he wasn't lying. The salad was so light and refreshing. The fish was cooked perfectly and just melted in mouth. I highly recommend this place is you want to eat something super good to eat"

      "The automatic gratuity at the end of my brunch check put a damper on what was a tasty brunch, and I have to drop my star rating accordingly.I was in the area this morning for brunch, and stopped by what was the Old Karlo Bakery space. As you walk in, the counter is still full of delicious and nicely presented pastries. I ordered my usual Eggs Benedict, and liked what I had. In addition to the eggs and hollandaise, they served it with an asparagus spear and fresh, plump tomato garnished with I believe was basil. The veggies were an original touch!They were out of my first choice of mango mousse, so I ordered the strawberry one. It was sweet and creamy, with some coconut shavings. Like I mentioned, no complaints about the food. Service was very quick for a packed Saturday house.I saw the 15% automatic gratuity when I got my check. I would have tipped more but you know my position on automatic tips, especially as a solo diner.  Two of my favorite restaurants in town don't charge this, and their service is spectacular. Here's hoping Boulangerie does the same soon.",
      "It's a cute spot with nice vibes. The food is decent. I got the huevos rancheros which were tasty, of course not a traditional huevos rancheros!it was a little acidic and could have used some spices to balance it out.  I did find a sticker from some kind of food container baked in to my dish, which was disappointing. The coffee also had some kind of aluminum scrap in it as well. My boyfriend got the key west omelette and it was good, but it had sooooo many pickled onions in it. The menu had said sautéed onions so we had a different idea of what would have been inside. Typically this would have gotten two stars but that chocolate almond croissant was really good. It also took us longer to pay once we finished eating than it did to actually eat. The servers are kind but it's not the best service. Quite expensive for what you get as well.",

The Nutccino was delicious. It was the perfect dessert, the right amount of Nutella. The place was super cute, very aesthetic. Need to come back for food! But I did enjoy the latte!",

      "I've come to this French-style restaurant and pastry shop a few times to grab croissants, pastries and coffee to go but have never actually \"dined in\".  On my most recent visit I came here at around 1 p.m. on a Sunday.  The place was full as usual with all tables occupied (it always seems busy), but in my case I only wanted a few things to go and I was in and out relatively quickly.  I had a look at what was available in the display cases and grabbed a chocolate/almond croissant, a guava/cheese croissant, an apple tart and a cafe con leche.  Croissants were $5.25 each, the apple tart was $7.15 and the coffee $4.89, so all totaled my bill came to $24 and change before gratuity.  Maybe a touch on the expensive side as other reviewers have mentioned, but on the other hand, I cannot in any way complain about the quality of anything we've purchased here.  It's always been consistently good.",

      "I think the photo of how my sandwich was served to my table, speaks for itself...........................",
      "I've lived in the neighborhood for over 10 years and this establishment actually used to be good. Not sure who this new owner is or why it's over all quality has plummeted, but I constantly try to give this place a chance because it's so conveniently close to home, but  it always disappoints. Especially this last time. I sat down and watched as all the servers and employees walk pass me sitting at an empty table waiting for someone to make eye contact with me. I had to call a waiter over to get served. Then I waited damn near 30 minutes for a turkey sandwich. Now, the food here is rarely every delicious or satisfying, but how do you mess up a turkey sandwich? It's totally mind blowing. It was so incredibly bland and the bread felt old. I can confidently say it was the worst sandwich I've ever had. Not to mention they served it to me broken? Like literally the bread falling apart. They care that little that they couldn't use another bread and put at least a little effort into their presentation since everything else has gone to shit. Management please do better! Yelpers, save yourself the disappointment",
      "I could give five stars, but the only reason I can't is because of the service. The food is fantastic; I can't complain at all! My favorite is the dulce de leche croissant, which I hear is going to be a bestseller. If you're looking for a weekend brunch or a local casual breakfast, this is the place.Don't forget to order to go when you're done. Trust me, you'll regret it if you don't.",

      "That is ridiculous! Our croissants should absolutely be served warm. We apologize that yours was not. We have addressed this with the location management so they are aware. We hope you will consider giving us another try! Thank you"

      "Byblos in Miami Beach offers Mediterranean fare in a lively and colorful setting. It's a great sport for parties of various sizes but I recommend coming with a reservation or you'll be seated downstairs without one. The wait with a reservation isn't long. The menu offers a variety of options for different diet types. One of my go-to apps to share is the Turkish Dumplings. I usually like coming to Byblos for Miami Spice in August as their menu is representative of their regular menu and they really go all out. Byblos is a place I love to bring out of towners as they leave all satisfied. I will definitely be back.",
      "In A Nutshell:-Byblos is an upscale Mediterranean restaurant located in South Beach.-The moment you walk from the outside in, you are welcomed to a warmly decorated restaurant that transports you.-If you are grabbing dinner, the dimly lit environment is perfect for a romantic dinner.-You may hear some Middle Eastern beats spun by the DJ which adds to the ambiance.-You will walk out full from all the delicious food.-The Turkish Kale Salad is highly recommended, as well as the Crispy Baby Artichoke & the Short Rib Kebab.Overall, this is a really good Mediterranean restaurant in South Beach.",
      "Byblos blew me away with their service, presentation, and food quality. For an intimate atmosphere, consider dining outdoors in the evening. The inside had a very classy ambience with plush chairs and even a lounge in the back. When I was there they also had a DJ playing music near the bathroom area.My server Jean-Paul was fantastic. Answered my questions, gave great recommendations and was very attentive. I got the Spanish Octopus as a starter and it was so tender and fresh. Drinks-wise I ordered a mocktail version of one of their cocktails which is perfect since I don't drink. For my main course and side I got the Black Truffle rice and Thrice-cooked Fries, respectively. I must have gazed upon the gates of heaven after my first bite from the rice bowl because that was one of the tastiest truffle dish I've ever had! Plenty of chickpeas giving it a crunch with every bite really sealed the deal. The thrice-cooked fries were also amazing if you like super crispy fries. For dessert, I got the burnt honey ice cream. Highly recommend if you have room for dessert but not enough to finish the fancier options (like I did).I'm so happy I found this spot on my Miami trip. If you're ever here vacationing this place is a must-try!",
      "I was a guest at a  medical meeting , so ut was a fixed menu. This provided me the opportunity to sample 10 different dishes plus two desserts.  Everything was delicious from the lamb ribs and beef to the salads, rice and chicken. Everything was tender; toasted chick peas with subtle, not overpowering Mediterranean flavors. And the dessert.. oh my !! Was delicious.  This restaurant is highly rated for a reason .  My only concern about this dining experience was it was too much food! Go enjoy and let me know how you liked it.",
      "To start off the decorations and ambiance here is beautiful. They had little plants and the way they had the a/c set up there's a breeze blowing through The restaurant like you're outside on a windy night . The restaurant was a bit darker than I expected, most of the lighting came from the candles at each table . I went here for dinner on a Monday night it wasn't too busy .We ordered the 3 course chef's choice experience . We started off with one appetizer each I had the Turkish kale salad and the creamed spinach pide they were both delicious. I loved that the sale had every element it was sweet , sour , tangy , salted , crunchy everything blended seamlessly! I had the ottoman cartel cocktail I highly recommend it if you like beets and I tasted the Byblos old fashioned it was strong but good and goes really well with dessert. Our next course was 2 entrees each we had the middle eastern fried chicken , Atlantic salmon ,Persian kale rice and an asparagus dish . Everything was perfectly seasoned and I loved that they weren't too heave on the salt . For desert we had stuffed baklava and strawberry cheesecake qatayef both were delicious! Our server was very attentive and always had our drinks refilled as need and out next course ready to be brought out . I would definitely come back !",
      "I had a super meal and experience when I visited Byblos.  As Miami natives, we were looking for something Mediterranean in South Beach on a night we were doing the tourist thing.  Byblos was top of the charts on Yelp.  We saw a high average rating and complimentary reviews and wanted to give it a go.  If I had to go with a headline for my review it would be \"Great food, a little pricey.\"  But you know the saying, you get what you pay for. What you are paying for besides excellent food is a true SoBe experience.  Our service was excellent.  The ambiance and decor were very cool and super chill ... Although I would not expect anything less from a classy restaurant in Miami Beach.  Everything we ordered was better than average.  Byblos is a do again and I would recommend it to anyone who is a tourist, or playing one for the day like we were.  I also strongly suggest getting a reservation.  Bon appetite.",
      "We wanted to try a new place for Miami spice and this place was amazing. The taste of all the entrees were perfect. I can't complain! Salmon and Persian rice together was so yummy! My boyfriend has the shrimp rice with chicharron and he said it was so delicious, which I had a bite of too! He loves the fried chicken as he said it was very crispy. Kale salad and spinach pide is to die for! Overall, the food was really good. I gave it a star less due it being hot inside the day we went, even the bathroom. Didn't like that we were the first peopleThere and they sat a couple very close to us when restaurant was empty. Our waitress was really good, as she made sure no peanuts were in anything I ate. Did not like that they don't offer Miami spice when it's available but I guess I understand it's to make business as they're only open 4 hours each day. Will be back!",
      "We came back to Byblos for a double date during Miami Spice 2022. Everything from the ambiance, food, and service was spot on during our visit. We made reservations for an early Saturday evening dinner without any issues, and were able to park at the parking garage across the street. Instead of being seated upstairs like we were last year, we were seated at one of the comfy couch/tables on the first floor, which was much more lounge-y in my opinion. While our friends did not drink, my fiancée and I ordered the Byblos Old Fashioned, which is made with house spiced turkish coffee syrup. It was a subtle twist on a classic cocktail that made it really enjoyable!For dinner, us and our friends enjoyed the classic Duck Kibbeh and Lamb Ribs. Both are appetizers that Byblos is known for. You can't go wrong with ordering either one of these dishes! The duck is fantastic and the lamb ribs are tender and coated with a sweet and spicy sauce that really puts a twist you wouldn't expect on a meat/protein dish. Someone in our part also ordered the Black Truffle Pide ($10 supplement, not pictured), and was raving about it! For our meals, I ordered the Salmon, my fiancée ordered the Middle Eastern Fried Chicken with sides of Rock Shrimp Rice and Roasted Brussel Sprouts, while our friends also ordered the Middle Eastern Fried Chicken, with a side of Rock Shrimp Fried Rice and a supplement of Thrice Cooked Fries as a side ($11, also not pictured). I was skeptical about ordering Salmon, but I have to say this is one of the better salmon dishes I've had in Miami. The fish was very fresh and complemented with a citrus crème fraîche sauce. Everyone else enjoyed their Fried Chicken and Rock Shrimp Fried rice. Per our friend, the Thrice Cooked Fries (which brought a whole basket, it was a good portion!) were very crispy and truffle parmesan forward!For dessert, I unfortunately had a nut allergy and had to \"settle\" for the blood orange sorbet (still good)! The others had the Strawberry Cheesecake Qatayef and Stuffed Baklava.Byblos continues to be a hit on Miami Beach. Looking forward to our next visit to try something new!",
      "Byblos...where have you been all of my life?!?!? How could I have missed you while looking for places to eat at in South Beach over the years??? Located at the Royal Palm South Beach just off of Lincoln Road, Byblos is one of the most unique restaurants in Miami. They have an extensive Mediterranean-themed menu that is complemented by an absolutely gorgeous ambiance. There truly is something for everyone here, no matter what you're ordering or how much it costs! We finally had the opportunity to eat at Byblos during Miami Spice 2021. Based on the menu and the reviews, we knew we were in for a treat, but did not exactly know how good we were going to have it. Even on a week day at 7:30 PM, the restaurant was bustling and lively. Upon entering the restaurant, we were taken to our seats up stairs and passed by a DJ who was playing some live music. The downstairs area is very lounge-like and cozy, whereas the upstairs area felt more like a traditional high-end restaurant with Mediterranean themed decor and art work. We started the evening off with cocktails from their unique \"Cold Tea Service\". This cocktail service features spirit-infused tea for two at $36, and comes served in a teapot. Based on the server's recommendation, we went with the habibi margarite (cazadores reposado tequila + jojo's spiced strawberry tea + fresh lime juice). We were able to slowly enjoy this tea with our various Miami Spice Dinner items over the evening, and will re-order it next time for sure, maybe in a different flavor. For dinner on Miami Spice, we each got to choose two mezze, a main course, one side dish and a dessert. This included a bunch of food, but some of the highlights included the oh-so tender lamb ribs (A MUST ORDER!!!), duck kibbeh (very unique and delicious), Middle Eastern Fried Chicken, and the Turkish Dumplings (almost like a pizza). Sides included Brussels sprouts and rock shrimp fried rice. I can honestly say between both the quality and quantity of food we had, this was the best Miami Spice menu we tried for 2021. Hands down! By the time dinner was over, we had dessert which included the stuffed baklava for my girlfriend and sorbet for me due to my tree nut allergy. While everything was certainly tapas style, it was more than enough food for the both of us. We were able to take the brussel sprouts home to incorporate into our lunch for the next day.Byblos was the best way to cap off Miami Spice 2021. Everything from the ambiance, to the service and food was excellent. We will definitely be back and consider this to be near the top of our list for restaurants in South Beach. Hopefully they are in consideration to earn a Michelin Star for the upcoming Miami guide. Byblos is that good! Give it a try if you haven't already!",
      "Fantastic service, food and location.I went here for a family dinner on vacation and had an amazing experience. From the moment we walked in and throughout the entire course of the meal, everyone working at Byblos was smiling, friendly and accommodating.The menu consists of classic Eastern Mediterranean dishes with a bit of a modern take. The dishes are super flavorful. Many of the dishes are shareable and I would suggest ordering the food family style to get the most out of your experience. If there was one dish that I had to recommend it would be the Hummus Royale. The hummus is mixed with pomegranate seeds and beef tenderloin which makes for a nice flavor boost. There are many items on the menu and something great for everyone to try.Byblos is located right next to Ocean Drive which makes it a great place to come for dinner if you plan to walk around after. There is both indoor and outdoor seating. Indoors there are a few different seating options/different rooms to sit in. The outdoor seating is on a patio in the front of the restaurant surrounded by nicely landscaped plants. I would suggest making a reservation as it is a fairly popular spot.I would highly recommend eating at Byblos for a nice dinner with friends or family. The food is fantastic and the staff truly make the experience enjoyable.",
      "Hands down the best Miami Spice menu!! Fantastic food, 5 dishes instead of 3, options for a wine pairing, and super friendly staff. Went with a group of 6 friends on a Sunday evening with no reservation. Thankfully they were able to accommodate us since it definitely got more busy later in the night. They were even able to add on another chair for a friend who joined us late. Their Spice menu includes 2 appetizers, 1 entree, 1 side and 1 dessert PER PERSON! For $45 - can't beat that anywhere. We pretty much got everything on the menu between us all and had more than enough for everyone to try each dish. Lots of options for vegetarians & meat eaters alike. Literally everything we had was delicious - absolutely no complaints on flavors or portion or freshness! The server mentioned that they are changing their spice menu in September so we will definitely be back! Hopefully they will keep the spinach pide, hummus, eggplant manti, and cheesecake on the menu though :)"

The muni is loaded with awesome options .... from tacos to fries... and they put a Latin twist to it all. You could totally add some plátano maduro to your quesadilla! ....it's actually pretty amazing with the beef!

When they opened up a pop-up in Lincoln's Beard Brewery, I started getting my Lincoln's Beard on more. Ever since they left, I was hoping I'd get a taste again in they're taco pop-ups. Just like Cinderella got her dream come true, I got my crunchy taco pasteorado with that juicy pineapple and my selection of beers. I didn't even know they were there until I saw them there. Hidden in the back is what I like to call the \"alternative food truck\" and more of a \"ventanita\" with your favorites already embedded into the menu with refreshing new items offered all throughout. Union is small so make your way to the back and you'll see their little den with their stuff set up. I love it. Oh, and you gotta order the Queso Frito.",
      "After a stressful week of school & work I decided to go some place new to try tacos, I came across this little place that's somewhat of a bar & let me tell you it did not disappoint one bit!! From the vibe of the place to the yummy tacos & let me not forget to mention the immense amount of different beers you can try. Definitely need to go back and try the queso frito, that the table next to me got & it left my mouth watery just by looking at it",
      "Vegan tofu taco is amazing.  I wish they had vegan cheese so we could have had more options from the menu, though I appreciate them having tofu options! Hopefully vegan cheese soon will be the next move for them. LOVE THE TAINO SUN!"

      "The best New York pizza in the area.  They have traditional thin crust and Sicilian pizza by the slice.  They are open till 3 am so it's the place to go late night in wynwood.  I would highly suggest checking out Joes pizza.  The lobby is super cute and has a lot of pictures from their New York restaurant.  This is an additional location from New York.  If you're looking for New York pizza this is the spot.Street parking available.",
      "This was quick stop in with no wait and I'm glad there's a place like this in Wynwood where you can be in and out, just like they do it in New York. The slices will run you around 5 bucks and up and the portion isn't huge but if you get two slices you should be good to go or get their Sicilian pizza slice which is bigger.  There is enough seating in the front for a quick bite but if you're planning on something fancy with formal seating then this isn't the spot for you. If you want to order a box and take it to go they do have that option available. But this is perfect to stop by when you're waiting to go to an activity or don't want to splurge but want something delish.PS. Loved the playlist they had going. Some good throwback songs had my girls and I singing :-)",
      "Joe's brings the best of the best from Greenwich Village to Miami. NY-style pizza with a thin crunchy crust, sweet marinara, and giant slices  whats not to like??IG: @miamicheatdays for more recommendations",
      "I didn't even know this joint was there but I'm glad I found it because nothing beats NY style pizza slices after a night of fun and drinks. Thin sliced pepperoni, ricotta and plain cheese, so good I had to get two more slices and we ate a total of 5. Listen if thin slices and dripping cheese is what you like then this is your joint and the fact that they're open that late is the cherry on top so I've found my late night after party joint to satisfy my cravings. Ambiance is super chill and casual and all my party people were coming in at the same time but service is super fast and organized so thank you for your service.",
      "Pretty excited to have Joe's in Miami! I go to Joe's every time I go to New York and the one in Miami looks almost identical to the one in NYC. I got a slice of pepperoni and mushroom and although it was pretty flimsy it wasn't bad for late night pizza. I just wish they had garlic rolls! But I'll definitely be back again for some late night pizza.",
      "Excellent pizza located in the heart of Wynwood! Perfect for anyone just walking through and grab a slice or for taking home a nice Ny style pizza pie. Highly recommend",
      "Visiting from out of town. I wanted pizza by the slice so I ended up here. The location is in a good if you are looking for different places to shop.",
      "Definitely one of the top 10 pizza spots to go to in Miami!! The pizza was exactly what you would want in a New York slice like I enjoy. The dough was thin and did not flop, the ingredients were flavorful and that damn crust was crispy. You want a New York style pizza just come here there's no where else in the area to have a slice like this. There plenty that try but this is the real deal Holyfield !",
      "I love Joe's in West Village, but man the location in Wynwood is not good and doesn't resemble anything close to the NY location.First off, the pizza sauce is wayyy too sweet.  They should be ashamed of themselves. Who wants diabetes pizza???The dough was crisper and thinner than NY which I like since I'm from CT but the flavor and execution didn't hit the mark.  And it definitely doesn't resemble Joe's in New York. It lacked the herbs and spices I'm accustomed to in good pizza from the northeast.There are definitely better pizza places in Miami, which should say it all.This is a hard pass for me especially at $30 or greater per pizza.Sorry....",
      "One of my favorite New York pizza spots has made its way to Miami, when I walked in I felt like I was transported to NYC. Joe's is home to crispy, cheesy, classic slices & pies that are loved by so many including tons of celebrities. I ordered a Caprese slice which was my favorite & a cheese slice, they were both delicious. Joe's is great to grab a quick slice or order a pie to go PLUS they are open late so it's the perfect place to curb your late night craving for pizza after a night out."

      "Ordered via grubhub. Said the ordered was accepted but never arrived and then the restaurant closed. Terrible service. Buyer bewareUpdate: it ultimately was delivered outside our door without them contacting us. So it sat out there all night. but at least it was delivered.",
      "Avoid. Trust me. 1) Tacos are absolutely lame. Nearly tasteless, lifeless, and clearly low quality meats and veggies.  The \"brisket\" is absolutely not brisket. Embarrassing. 2) Automatic 20% Tip? For a fast food street taco place? And then they lie about it being \"standard in Brickell.\" No, it's not. And it's illegal, which is why I've already notified the County Attorney's office. 3) Do you like the sound of mass transit screeching overhead? All tables sit directly beneath a loud people mover, FYI. But this luxurious ambience must be how they justify their 20% gratuity.",
      "Stumbled on this taco place as I left a club nearby it was late and one of the places on the way home. Why not? Everybody needs a taco fix after a night. This place didn't really fulfill it for me, It's cool they have margaritas late night and chips and salsa but the tacos didn't do it for me. The quesa taco was overly greasy and not enough of any birria flavor. The chips came with a sweet green sauce that I've never in my years of eating tacos had I tried before. Margarita was good but that is all.",
      "Our waiter was very kind and knowledgeable of the menu and won't just suggest the priciest one. The SHRIMP TACO!!! 10/10 usually fried shrimp tacos are heavily battered but this was perfectly lightly coated giving the best textured bite. The sauce and toppings were so harmonious with the shrimp. OMG. the La Pilo was amazing as well but didn't have me dreaming ab it like the shrimp. The margaritas are must get here. Passion fruit is the best bc it's not too sweet like the strawberry one. The corn app was alright but too liquid-y... The Quesadilla (the birria one??) was 11/10.",
      "Friendly service! Had the shrimp tacos which were tasty but a bit salty. We lucked out that it was happy hour and had a huge sangria.",
      "The tacos were amazing and the service was especially wonderful. Very kind staff and worth a visit!",
      "When I was younger, food after a fun night out consisted of a certain Taco chain. Now as an adult with a more sophisticated (even for late night) palate, I'm glad that the late 90's movie was wrong and the chain restaurant didn't win the franchise wars #geekoutI'd been to Pilo's Miami Beach location awhile back for a Yelp Elite event, and was glad to find their Brickell location after a Saturday night out in Brickell / Downtown. I managed to snag a seat on their outside terrace and take in some peoplewatching along with yummy texmex.The chips were adequately crispy, and both the pico and green salsa tasty. The green one actually had a nice blend of heat with a hint of sweet. My chicken burrito had plenty of meat and black beans. It was certainly late night gourmet!",
      "Randomly decided to eat at this place while exploring the Brickell area. Seating is outdoor which kinda sucked since it was so hot the night we were there. Their water cups are so small you finish your water in like 3 gulps. We ordered the guacamole and corn for appetizer and loved both! The corn was amazing and I wish I had more. For our tacos we got the pastor, birria and the brisket one. The pastor tacos were not the best. The birria desperately needed some salt. The brisket tacos were delicious! The tacos were kinda overpriced in my opinion.",
      "Great taco spot in Brickell. They have outdoor seating which is nice especially in the Miami heat. They have good fish tacos for a reasonable price. Not great for groups, good for a small date."

      "An exceptional, elegant omakase experience. I caught a ride to the restaurant as parking in the area seemed limited to nonexistent. I would have appreciated some dedicated parking. Once inside you can sense a lot of care and effort went into the modern, intimately lit design. They have a small number wait / lounge area as we got there a few minutes early. After a few minutes they were ready for us at the main chef table bar. I'd frame it as semi-selective. You share the space with a few other diners (not too many) but are facing the chef preparation area. Other omakases I've visited have a more private area, which is something I think is a nice feel. Still, semiprivate worked in this design. Outside of that, the food was simply phenomenal. The chef was friendly and clearly loved what he did. Ingredients fresh and uniquish. They had great service and otherwise paid good attention and were as accommodating as possible for food allergies. If the opportunity arises, I would return in a heartbeat. My two favorites included the caviar scallop sushi as well as the hand roll. Wow the sushi is fresh. Two additional notes: I felt they gave enough food to be satisfied. I also don't think they cut corners with quality or quantity. For example, they had a high quality uni (sea urchin) and were generous with this delicacy not stingy. This was incredibly welcome as some other omakases leave you too hungry after, which is head scratching for such an expensive experience. Second, if you order sake, you're in for a nice surprise... they have such beautiful ceramics throughout and they bring out a selection of cups for you to choose. After factoring ambiance, service, food quality, food portions, plating, chef friendliness as well as staff attentiveness and some bonuses, I'd say this omakase is worth it if it's under your consideration.",
      "As very avid sushi lovers, my wife and I were excited to try Hiyakawa.  We specifically like traditional sushi which is dressed and presented as nigiri.  As the rating shows - we both thought that the food is just OK.  The positive highlights would be the design of the space and the service.  Both are excellent.  Unfortunately, the food is outrageously priced and falls well short of expectations.  Compared to other local sushi restaurants such as Uchi, Itamae, and Scratch - Hiyakawa is not worth a repeat visit. My wife and I ordered a lot of the nigiri on the menu (see photo).  The server brings you soy sauce and a brush to season the fish as you like.  I personally didn't care for this and wish that the sushi chefs would already dress the fish as they see fit.  When you charge $25 for a single piece, I would expect the fish to be dressed and have a flavor profile.  Unfortunately, no sushi piece really stood out and there's nothing original here.  Yes, they import the fish directly from Japan but today that's table stakes for any high-end sushi restaurant.  Overall - the food here is OK but definitely not worth the price.  You have a lot better options.",
      "Amazing experience. Went the a-la-carte route in the dining room instead of omakase and no regrets. Miguel is an amazing server who took his time to explain and offer suggestions --he played a big part in the experience. The chefs team is so passionate and it shows. They subtly wait for your reaction to what they now is purely exquisite bliss in a bite. Just all around amazing. Love the quiet setting and contemporary design.",
      "In March 2020, I was supposed to go to Japan for cherry blossoms and sushi. Well, that didn't happen. But tonight, this 17-course omakase dinner made me look forward to the the day I actually get to go. Amazing matcha, sushi, sashimi, chawanmushi, and wagyu wonderfully plated and presented. Definitely give this place a try if you're ever in Miami! Book the chef's counter to talk to Royce (9 yrs a sushi chef) and Masa (20 yrs a sushi chef). Combined, their sushi knowledge is older than I am!Friendly staff, great service, delicious food, beautiful space. Can't ask for any more.",
      "I wanted to love it but I am disappointed after spending so much money at Hiyakawa. As others have noted in their reviews, the food was good but not THAT $$$$ good. I have lived in Japan and had several Japanese dining experiences there and in the US, in several ranges of style and price. This place is trying to be and do a lot of things but in the end just felt overbearing, alienating and overpriced. Why the soy sauce brushes? Black sesame ice cream was chocolate ice cream (too hard) with a few black sesame seeds on top. I guess dessert is not the main attraction but at those prices shouldn't have been such a miss. Having Japanese named things on the menu without a written English (or Spanish lol) explanation is unnecessarily pretentious and does nothing in the way of \"tradition\". Bathrooms are too bright. I will continue my search for real Japanese food in Miami. I am thinking I'll try Azabu next?",
      "Worth a visit. Great service, great food. Pretty good wine selection . Didn't try the omakase but got to order nigiri ala carte. Would come again if I was in town",
      "One of the most traditional and delicate sushi and omakasa experiences.  They focus on quality and the restaurant is spectacular.  Chef Masa is a master and one of the original SushiDen Japan chefs.",
      "I attended the collaboration dinner between Chef Alex Chang and Hiyakawa on Saturday evening. Reservations are made online and are prepaid, whether for event dinners or omakase dinners. Their dining room reservation is a la carte only. The restaurant itself is small and cozy, with the interior adorned with light wood fixtures and furnishings. We were seated at the counter and had a view of the chefs working. The dishes came out very timely and was paced well. Everything I tried was incredible! Everyone in our party enjoyed every dish, which is a huge compliment to Hiyakawa and Chef Chang. Some highlights for me included the beef tartare on homemade milk bread, citrus and avocado salad with fried seaweed, buckwheat waffle with koji cream (loved the DIY aspect here too), all of the nigiri from Hiyakawa, and both desserts - soba panna cotta with strawberry granita and Japanese whiskey cake with roasted cream, hojicha mousse, and hazelnut and granola crumble. The service was great and very attentive. The servers made sure to explain to us what each dish was and how best to enjoy. The chefs at the counter checked in on us as well. If I'm ever back in Miami, I am coming back to Hiyakawa for their omakase! Amazing experience and dinner!",
      "Perfect place to spend time and eat best Japanese food in Miami! No loud music, no loud people! The food is perfect, their fish is awesome. Scallops with tomatoes and grape are amassing, you should degenerate try it! This place worse it's money!!!!",
      "The omakase here is delicious. Atmosphere is nice. My only problem is they don't accept reservations over 4 people, and they make absolutely no exceptions.Uni tastes like peanut butter *drool*"

      "What an amazing spot, we absolutely LOVED it. It's fairly young and trendy, so I would not take my baby boomer parents here (or a baby in general)- but for a younger, fun, lively crowd, this is perfect. The inside is really cool - lots of artwork, somewhat hidden restaurant, similar to a speakeasy. The drinks were unique and incredible and the food was OUTSTANDING! Very gastronomic - if you're into that sort of thing (my parents wouldn't get it). We basically ordered the entire menu, until we nearly exploded. Here were a few memorable plates (as in, those I can remember after imbibing for a few hours)...Spanglish milk bread - the black salt on top. WOW. They say, once you go black (salt), you never go back right? Exactly. The guava butter was unlike any butter I have ever had. It's very tropical, and fruity! Wagyu beef ravioli - that blue cheese sauce was to die for - take some of that milk bread and drunk your bread in this sauce to your heart's desire (and worry about the consequences later, because bread and cheese, whew!) Nitro Watermelon Tataki - the only remotely healthy thing that entered our mouths at dinner. It's such a cool fish - watermelon, pomegranate seeds, toasted pumpkin seeds, olive oil and a total flavor overload. Not to mention the fact that the fish came out looking like sashimi grade tuna. So cool. Arroz Mamposteado - this was a cool fish. It was rice and beans, but mixed with avocado creme and and pork belly and chips. Incredible. I'm not much of a dessert but holy smokes did we devour the suspiro. I'm quite positive I licked the jar towards the end of the evening - don't judge me. I wish I could remember what cocktail I had, but the choices are all so unique and fun, I should have tried them all. Eh, gives me a reason to go back, right?!",
      "Thank you so much for the kind words and the detailed review of all of our dishes, Shannon.  It was a pleasure hosting you, and we look forward to your next visit!",
      "Obsessed is an understatement.Found this place on Yelp (I love you Yelp!) and with the rating and images I knew I was SOLD. The show stopping, craft cocktails is what I came for and I wasn't sure what to expect once we came. Was it a hype? Would I be disappointed? Who cares! You're in Miami and going to a Spanglish cocktail bar. We didn't make reservations but we did read it wasn't too hard to get in. And it was exactly just that. Came here at around 9:30 pm on a Saturday night and we were seated to the side entrance table with couches right away. It wasn't a good option for dining but we literally only came here for the cocktails so it was perfect!The vibe check in this place was everything. There was a live dj tucked in to the side making sure the music was on point. And it was!On to the craft cocktails:I ordered the Pornstar Mejican@ and it was delicious wish the mezcal was more of the star of the show and to be honest, given that everyone else's cocktails were truthfully visually so pleasing wish the presentation for this one was as well but that's totally ok!!! I still loved my experience. My hubby ordered the Cafetera Old Fashioned and WOW. What a presentation and fun way to serve it with an actual cafetera. It was definitely a show stopper. The Caipirinha Frizá was delicious and very unique as well and the Paparazzi came served in a photo lens so that was pretty cool!We loved Spanglish, would be back in a heart beat. Overall great vibes for cocktails and pretty cool presentation that really makes this place stand out. Excited to try their food next time!",
      "This place gives my New York Vibes OD! It's definitely giving New York Speakeasy Vibes. You'll probably miss it if your not paying attention because the sign outside is only a neon bottle sign. Inside is intimate with the cutest decor, low key, playing all the classic jams. I love a place that sets a vibe with an good playlist! Okayyy! We came for drinks after dinner, so we didn't order food but they did have a menu. All the drinks we ordered were sooo freakin good, and were in creative instagram worthy cups. This is definitely going to be my new hideaway spot. Service was amazing! Will be coming back!",
      "Okay, here's the thing with this place, it's so freaking loud that you can barely hear the person next to you, it's impossible to have any sort of conversation with a large group of people. The food was okay and drinks were pretty good on the other hand, so I think this is a good place for dates, just not a large gathering.",

      "The entrance to Spanglish is so subtle that it's easy to miss! Once you enter, the ambiance is cozy, intimate, and welcoming. We came because of the happy hour -- their cocktails were $9 and some small dishes were marked down! We ordered a round of the caipirinhas first and sadly were a bit disappointed, it was way more tart than expected and just tasted like lemon juice. The Chilcano tasted similar with the overpowering citrus. The Spanglish mule was way better! For small plates, we ordered the octopus croquettes, Caribbean dumplings, and a side of yuca. The octopus croquettes were my favorite of the items we ordered -- crispy, served hot, and the octopus inside was tender. The Caribbean dumplings were a little mushy, and the yuca was a bit tough and the sauce it was served with tasted like Big Mac sauce which I am not a fan of. Everything came out pretty fast, though!",
      "Finally got to visit Spanglish and let's just say I fell in love! I came here for happy hour with a friend and honestly we were blown away by how delicious everything was. We ordered the Spanish Milk Bread, Timba Frita, Queso E' Craba , and Tuna Tostadas. My favorite dish we tried was the Timbra Frita. It was the perfect bite full of flavor. We also ordered cocktails. We both ordered the Paparazzi which honestly tasted amazing but the presentation was killer. It comes served in a camera lens. Overall this place is a vibe. The music was lit. They were playing bad bunny. The artwork is awesome. I definitely see myself coming back here.",
      "Location a bit hidden in plain sight, so be sure to stop and read signs. Small  and intimate setting with a great ambiance for drinks and light bites with friends. The food was ok nothing over the top or extraordinary. I did like my margarita with the seafood bites. Drinks here before a walk around in Wynwood is never a bad idea.",
      "This place has no sign in front. We drive up and down and finally found it. Outside looks like it was closed. Nothing indicating it was opened except for a sign out front that shows menu of the day. We walked it and surprisingly was like wow. This is a cute small cozy restaurant.  The booth I say were pretty close to one another.  The bar area has 6 stools. The food was excellent! Extremely flavorful and so good. The octopus appetizer was amazing. We ordered one of their popular dish and weren't disappointed.  I forgot to photo that dish because I was so hungry.  Everything we had was great including the drinks. We love craft drinks and for sure it was super crafty. The paparazzi drink was so cute. It came in a camera cup and tasted great.I would be definitely coming back here again soon and recommend everyone to try if you haven't been here.",
      "Came here to try a few drinks on a Friday night and it wasn't as busy as I expected. I was able to sit at the bar and watch the bartender make these really cool looking and tasty drinks! The paparazzi was my favorite. Something about the dill and passion fruit combination was something I didn't know I needed. The vuela paloma was just okay, I'm just not the biggest fan of grapefruit. And the cafetera old fashioned tasted like a REALLY strong Cuban coffee, which I really enjoyed. Although the drinks were great, the vibe was kinda ruined by these drunk idiots sitting next to us at the bar, yelling and screaming. But I would still come here again to enjoy a cool curated cocktail."

      "Seaspice is known to Miami locals as a very high end resturant, frequented by celebrities.  I have no idea why.  The service is pretty awful.  The drink runners are horrible.  It takes about 30 minutes for just a drink to be brought out to you.  The food is mediocre.  It is definitely NOT worth the price, which is very expensive.  I am giving two stars because the view is amazing.  Seaspice is right on the water and has a gorgeous ambiance.  You can watch yachts drive by and some will even pull up and park.  The other star is for the tres leches.  This dessert was AMAZING, I would go back just to eat it again.  But otherwise, Seaspice is nothing special.  Save your money.",
      "A place that tries to be high end but fails to deliver.Service ? Mediocre Food ? Below parFirst thing when you check in is they tell you that you have a 2 hr max(tacky)",
      "I read this was one of the best patio dining AND a hot spot for celebrities in Miami, so I had to go check it out on our recent travels to this area...Initially I was worried about our luggage situation, as we had to carry our luggage to the restaurant since this was our last stop in Miami. However, they were very accommodating, and let us store some of our stuff in the closet, and we kept the big luggage with us, near our table.As expected, the patio scene was spectacular...city skyline and seaside views, with plenty of yachts passing by! The place indeed had that chic celebrity vibe...truly FAB! Loved the music overhead as well. Somehow, I expected some snobbiness...but not at all. Service was great!Then the food. OMFG...I've had some amazing foods lately, but this takes the cake. Even the complimentary bread was amazing (and unique)! My husband ordered this Wagyu Burger, and I chose this Ragu Pappardelle ( THE best Ragu Pappardelle I've ever had...EVER. ). Then this Pavola dessert...again, just beyond delish. Truly, this was foods for the celebrities.Honestly, I'm shocked at how low the rating is for this place. I assume that if the service isn't top notch, it would probably piss some folks off. The pricing was on the outlandish side...with even lunch entrees starting at around 40. There was even an appetizer item priced at around 70 bucks! Luckily, like I said, I felt that the foods and the service (and especially the spectacular ambiance) made up for it. There was this big yacht parked right near us, which somewhat blocked some of the views from the left. Still, we got our eyeful of seaside/yachtside views.In any case, this was a great way to end our trip in Miami.",
      "Went here with a group of girlfriends for brunch and everything was delicious, they were super accommodating as well.I had the froze , a cucumber and gin cocktail and 2 grey goose and sodas and all were fantastic.As a table we split the fresh fish and a couple sides and it was delicious. Also love the free bread It is definitely on the pricier side overall tbh but great for a fun \"fancy\" brunch",
      "Came here for Miami spice and although we spent more than we thought we would, we had a good time. Everything was delicious. The kale Caesar had pecans and Granny Smith apple slices, never had a Caesar like this but it was a nice change! The Shrimp Pesto Whole Wheat Spaghetti was my favorite, even though I'm not the biggest fan of pesto. The burger was good too just a little messy from the truffle aioli. The chocolate cremoso and tres leches was very good but I'd go with the cremoso for the cocoa nib crumble, yum! All in all, I think it's overpriced and I probably won't come here again because of that. The cheapest bottle of Chardonnay was $75 and most drinks were $20. I only came here for Miami spice and still spent almost $200.",
      "Given we still have Miami Spice going on until the end of the month we decided to try out the lunch menu @ Seaspice gorgeous location on the Miami River, sitting outdoor is really relaxing, so beautiful to watch the boats go by, really lovely To start we had the Comte' Cheese Soufflé, I have to admit this was a bit disappointing, it really did not have the texture of a real soufflé  but then............ the Shrimp Pesto Whole Wheat Spaghetti and the Pan-Seared Chilean Seabass were really good as dessert, both the Tres Leches and the Chocolate Cremoso were yummy Try it out before Miami Spice ends, you can check out the Miami Spice Menus on miamiandthebeaches.com@seaspicemia",
      "First time for me at Seaspice, it is located on the banks of the Miami River it is a gem that you should not miss. Sit outside in the courtyard enjoy your food and a drinks while watching the boats go by, just beautiful We had the Miami Spice lunch which has a very affordable fix price 3 course menu for $ 28, unfortunately this will end soon, nevertheless, I would defiantly go back again for sureRegarding the Miami Spice menu only one observation, they should have had more than one choice for the Entrees without the extra charge, right now you have 4 choices and 3 of these have extra charge on it, not really fair given that you are promoting the Spice menu, you should have at least two or three choices included in the price and one or two with the extra charge We had had Prince Edward Island Mussels, Grilled, the Grilled Faroe Island Salmon and the Profiteroles and Peaches and Cream. My favorite where the Mussels, the garlic pizza bread they brought for the table was absolutely delicious, the Salmon was good too. I had the Peaches for dessert and it was ok, not really my thing, my friend said the Profiteroles were great, next time I will not opt for the healthy dessert We enjoyed all with a good Albariño wine, our experience was made especially enjoyable by our waiter Fabrizio, he was really great ! Thank you Fabrizio @seaspicemia",
      "Bad first impression. Its not a nice feeling to feel like you have to beg to spend your money at a restaurant. Every year I look forward to Miami Spice. It's a great way to try out various restaurants and a unique spread of menu options. Seaspice was on my radar and happened to be one of the participating restaurants offering the Miami Spice menu. I contacted the restaurant in advance and made a reservation for 3:30p for a party of four. My mom who is from out of town was excited to join us for lunch. I advised the restaurant we were doing the Miami Spice menu. The restaurant made it clear that they charge $50pp for No Shows. At 3:15pm, we arrived for our reservation. The hostess Karin greeted us, and advised us that they were running behind on the reservations and because of this they will not be able to offer the Miami Spice menu. Only the a la-carte menu will be offered. This was a bit upsetting because we drove almost an hour to get there and the restaurant is refusing to offer the Miami Spice promotion. Our natural instinct was to just say forget it we will go somewhere else. I mean, at the end of the day who wants to beg to spend their money? It's absurd. If the restaurant is offering a promotional menu and because to no fault of our own they are running behind why should we be penalized?My Mom looked so bummed out. Because she was so excited to try this place. I decided to walk back in and ask for a Manager. The Manager took 20min to come out. When he finally did come over, he introduced himself as Collin. I explained to him what was going on and it seemed as though he wasn't aware that the hostesses were turning Miami Spice customers away. He decided to make it right and advised Karin to honor the Miami Spice menu. Impressive! Things were turning around. Besides the encounter at the hostess stand, the restaurant is beautiful. It is situated on Miami's waterfront were you can view the million dollar yachts passing by. They also have docks for those interested in docking and dining. You can view the downtown city skyline which I am sure looks amazing at night.The food was excellent. The Miami Spice menu offered a three course lunch for $28. You have the choice of a starter (Kale Salad, Cheese Souffle, or White Gazpacho). A choice of entrees (Seabass, Chicken Breast, Shrimp Pesto Pasta, Wagyu Burger, or Plant Bowl). And a choice of dessert (Tres Leches or Chocolate Cremoso). They also offer the option to add a Glass of wine for and additional $12. I ordered the Comte Cheese Souffle, the Green Circle Farms Chicken Breast, and the Tres Leches. The others in my party ordered the Kale Salad, Gazpacho, and Seabass. For starters, My favorites were the Kale Caesar Salad and Cheese Souffle. The Kale Caesar had a mix of shredded Granny Smith apples, pecans and a creamy Caesar dressing. The cheese Souffle was like a fluffy egg Souffle with a cream parmesan sauce and tomato chutney. Delicious!For entrees, both the Seabass and Chicken breast were amazing. The Chicken breast was tender and juicy, served on top of a creamy polenta and topped with corn, peas, and mushrooms. The seabass was seared nicely to give a nice crunch on the outside, while perfectly flaky and moist on the inside. It was served with stewed garbanzo, Swiss chard, and smoked potato. For desserts, we all had Tres Leches. It was served in a small Mason jar topped with 3 milks, and berries. Perfect way to end the meal. The portions are not large but it is filling. The flavors are fresh and very well balanced. The food presentation was notable. The Watermelon Tequila drink was delightful and refreshing. The froze was also a big hit. The cocktails were presented well and created perfectly. We enjoyed everything. Our waiter, Austin was very friendly. He made great recommendations and was very attentive.An 18% gratuity was added to the tab. There are lots of street parking accessible. In the end, the food was great. Ambience was amazing. The hostesses can use additional customer service training and learn to use better judgment to improve the customers experience. There was no need to escalate the matters to a manager. It could have been handled properly by showing empathy, apologizing, and finding a solution to the problem.",
      "Hi Kim,Thank you for dining with us and leaving a detailed review. It has been forwarded to our management team. Our apologies for the confusion at the door.  Glad to hear Collin accommodated you and your experience was turned around.  We are happy to see your great feedback regarding the food, cocktails, and Austin’s Service.  Hopefully you will join us again in the near future!",
      "This is my second time going to sea spice & I normally love it as the first time. I never leave bad reviews But this second time MY PHONE WAS STOLEN AND SECURITIES DID NOThing about it. Instead we're trying to blame me for the situation. I'm not drunk nor was drunk. I walked in with 2 phone and walked out with 1.We came as my friend USUALLY does and this is how they treated us  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME. I thought it was 5 star so nothing could go wrong. With a security right next to our table my phone STILLL got stolen. It was on the table. And to whoever has the time to steal phones is just sad imagine what else they can steal... I wil ask to review cameras but with the way I was treated when I let them know I lost my phone I doubt they will be helpful but I'll let every platform form of review know that they steal phones here. I know the exact time frame as well so they wouldn't even have to look much at the cameras. Let's see. BTW I BEEN HOME SICK AFTER EATING THESE OYSTERS I COULDNT Even celebrate my baby's birthday w him.",
      "Came here for my birthday dinner with my boyfriend for a 7:15 reservation (we called in advance for an outdoor seat dock side) we waited about ten minutes after our arrival for our table to be ready at the bar, the short wait was definitely worth it. Started with an aperol spritz at the bar then ordered octopus and gazpacho to start. Octopus portion was good but the olive oil tasted burnt since it came out on a sizzling hot cast iron looking skillet (its very easy to overcook octopus, please just bring a regular plate next time.) I also had the whole main lobster. Extremely delicious large portion of perfectly cooked and seasoned lobster, bravo. My boyfriend had the truffle coated Chilean sea bass and he absolutely loved it. Vibe: 5/5 this place definitely is a scene but not overwhelmingly pretentious or obnoxious. Absolutely loved the music as well. Service:3/5 A bit slow, our server was very attentive when we were able to get his attention but we had to always wave him down. Food: 4/5 everything was honestly pretty good (octopus could've had a bit more attention to detail)",
      "Hi Liz,Thank you for celebrating your birthday with us!  We are so happy to hear you had a great experience and enjoyed the food.  Your feedback regarding the octopus has been sent to our chef. We look forward to seeing you again soon!"

      "Overall: Amazing food. We will definitely be back! The Great: - Biscetta allá Fiorantina. We got the serving for 2. Incredible. - Tiramisu OMG - get it. - Tableside Caesar - Very nice server - Ben - Foccacia bread The good: - Meatball App - The wine cellar and steak presentation as you walk in is a nice touch General feedback: - Dimming the lights a bit more would give it some real ambiance and a homier feel  - They JUST opened so cut the staff some slack. I've been on a team opening a restaurant before and it's so hard. They did great! - Good location - easy access with ample parking. A local steakhouse is just what the neighborhood needs - The staff was really sweet and everyone was really working hard all night.",
      "Went here for a birthday dinner. They have a great menu with all sorts of selections.  Our waiter was pushy and rude.  We ordered a NY Strip, Branzino, Pasta Bolonaize, Filet Minan, truffle fries and salad.  The steaks were ordered medium well done.  All the food was good except the steaks.  They kept bringing back the steaks rare and the waiter was angry with nasty comments toward us.  If you go here avoid this guy.  We told the mgr who seemed surprised.",
      "The staff and Marco was amazing! The food, absolutely Devine, the portion the flavor, the attention to detail were all perfection. Thank you for making my husband's 40th bday so memorable.",
      "Hello my name is Nick. Of course I'm from New York. I usually don't write reviews specially bad ones we got to this nice restaurant very gorgeous inside. The bread was delicious. I have to say the first course was a pasta dish we split. It had a Bolognese sauce on it it was served hot and good. Little did I know that was the highlight of a dinner. My steak came out first they cut it up which I wasn't crazy about but it was cold. my friends ordered a veal dish a special order. They accommodated them but the dish also was ice cold. The dish presentation was very nice but it being cold was definitely a problem. I must mention the sides to twice cook baked potato was a baked potato not twice cooked. The cream spinach was nice fresh baby spinach sautéed with melted cheese on top. The menu, said cream of spinach. I do wish they would get their act together, and I would even consider trying it again. The Decour is very elegant. It was Christmas Eve. We got there at 6:15 and it wasn't that busy. There was no excuse for the cold food. I must say I was very disappointed. My name is nick hogan.",
      "Nice bar.  Quality food.   Good service    Except bartender Angie.  Good wine and liquor selection",
      "Great new restaurant. Not crowded yet. We got frutti dimare and branzino, both dishes were excellent. I especially liked that unlike many other places they go easy on a salt. Highly recommend!",
      "Rippoff stupid place out of place Does not belong among working class neighborhood Just close down and go to Ball Harbor",
      "Ridiculous prices for a basic Italian restaurant It will never make it in NMB Will not bring lunch customers at this prices Dinner customers will go to a well known reliable restaurant",
      "My boyfriend and I had been waiting for what felt like an eternity for this place to open because we love Frank so we had to check out a place named after his iconic song. Just like his song, our experience was great! The place feels intimate and has a great ambiance for a date night. The food was also incredible! Yet, the best part was the service. Our server Andrea was so sweet and helpful the entire night. I highly recommend!",
      "One of the most authentic Italian restaurants I've ever eaten at!  First rate and class-  Look forward to having many more meals at My Way!  Thanks to the incredible staff for an incredible evening.",
      "Perfect place for date night! The food was amazing and the staff very friendly and attentive. Can not go wrong with the BURRATA CAPRESE for starter and my favorite the FILETTO DI MANZO! So many tasty options can't wait to go back next time I am in town!"

      "We walked by and heard music thumping with lights moving and the sign said Sushi.  Let's go!Place was cute! Looks like a restaurant/club. Had a small dance floor, DJ was spinning old school music mix with new age. Fog machine was blowing every 30 mins. Drinks were STRONG and food was delicious.  It wasn't so crowded on a Thursday night but it was very live. I loved it and would come back here for sure. The sushi and appetizer were all good.",
      "My friend and I got food poisoning from this place. I ended up being ok, but my friend literally almost blacked out and could barely focus on feeling better because the staff was **downright kicking her out of the place. I understand if she had made a mess, ok, that would be reasonable. However, she didn't even get sick... she just needed somewhere to sit and regain her vision. We explained this to them, yet she was still being passionately kicked out, hence the 1 star.Nothing memorable other than having my friend get rushed out after being served poor-quality seafood. I feel like I would've had a better & much safer time at the equally-pricey & wannabe-trendy 1-800 Lucky just a few blocks down.At least my sushi roll got torched and had a sexy name, right? If you have spare time & money to waste and you're also OK with risking food poisoning in wynwood, try it out :)",
      "This place was amazing! The drinks were so good and they have a special one that comes in a Lucky Cat cup, and although their food is a bit pricey, it's 100% worth the cost. Everything me and my friends ordered was so delicious, especially the BDM Fried Rice.The atmosphere is very unique as well. It has this old South Asian wartime vibe with a tank and war propoganda, it makes me feel like the place's name is based off of Viet Kong Guerilla Warfare. Pretty neat.Definitely check it out if you're in the area and want a fun night time experience.",
      "Cool vibes. Asian style food. Servers could be more attentive. Nice place for a dimly lit dinner date.",
      "A vibe with amazing food!THE PLACE: Located in Wynwood, of course parking is tricky but possible to find. Back door Monkey was very cute and quaint full of eclectic neon lights making it picturesque. The music, ambiance, sparklers made the  location so memorable! THE FOOD: On my visit, I had the following - Drinks: Noise reduction 3/5 a bit tart. Red Monkey 5/5 refreshing and light.Food:  Spring rolls 5/5 crunchy goodness, Shrimp dumpling 3/5 not bad, but didnt shine like the rest of the food, Sweet & spicy pork belly 5/5 so good, and I dont even like pork lol Octopussy roll 4/5, Salmon belly roll 5/5. All were so fresh, had great texture, were flavorful, and more importantly so fresh.THE SERVICE: Bartenders were professional and did their jobs well.",
      "Back door monkey is located in the heart of Wynwood right across from Oasis and  has top notch sushi! I Highly recommend the occtopussy roll, it was by far my favorite of the night.  Cocktails were good, they one that special one that comes in a Lucky Cat cup that was delicious!  However, I wasn't a fan of the dessert options, feel like they should add a more wow factor to the dessert menu with more flavor to keep up with the vibe of the place. Overall though, if you're looking for a cool vibe, good music and yummy cocktails , i would recommend this place. It gets packed so make sure to call ahead with reservations.",
      "This place has fallen victim to the \"aesthetics over food\" trend that has been happening to a lot of new restaurants lately.The place is decorated really trendy, it's instagrammable but the food is really average and overpriced for what you get. I had 2 drinks and a sushi roll and payed around $70. The sushi roll wasn't bad and the drinks tasted good but had barely any liquor. Also, while we were at a table a photographer took a photo of us which we thought was super nice and was for their social media or whatever and then came back with it printed in a frame trying to sell it to us for $20. It was really awkward and came off as shady. The DJ was playing bangers and the hostess and server were super sweet but for the price of the food and for the quality of the drinks I will not be returning unless it's for happy hour and I'm getting a double shot.",
      "Went here for my birthday dinner and it had such a great atmosphere to start your night off. Had shrimp dumplings to start & the Octopussy - they were too good.",
      "I came here on a Thursday for ladies night. I thought the $29.99 deal was too good to be true, but it is great!However, the service isn't so great. My server didn't speak much English, so I tried some of my Spanish. We were mostly able to communicate, until the bill came. She tried to charge me and my friends for an additional drink EACH! With the ladies night deal you get an app, an entree, a dessert, and two drinks. We all got our two drinks and my friend got one extra and the waitress tried to overcharge all of us. When it was my turn to pay she said my bill was about $55, but I only got items included in the ladies night deal. She gave me a hard time because one of my friends couldn't finish her drink, so she gave me her drink. The waitress asked me if I was \"sure\" I didn't order a 3rd drink and when I said no, she called over the manager. The manager confirmed I did not order an extra drink and I only had the ladies night deal. It was a whole thing....The food was actually pretty good and the drinks as well. I had the shrimp tempura for an app. The tuna roll for the entree. And finally the only dessert they offered on the deal, a very melted ice cream and brownie. They all tasted good. I ordered the jungle monkey drink and liked it but 80% of it was ice. I probably won't return unless my friends really want to go back.",
      "Our server Daniel was very niceWe went for Maki Hour - prices were very reasonable for a happy hour. Ambiance is dope with a very sultry decor, dim lighting. The DJ booth is an armored tank and there are other interior pieces that are aesthetically pleasing to admire while you dine.The Drinks: I had the $7 Noise Ordinance Cocktail which was good but I finished in like 2.2 seconds. Not my favorite but I'm also hard to please with cocktails. (I like them strong) Not a problem - O Quickly switched over to the $6 wine. My date had the Uwakimono and A Pear of Drunken Monkeys cocktails which also weren't that amazing. The Food: In short, sushi worth trying and some of the better sushi I've had in awhile. We had the octopussy roll which of course presentation wise was dope with the torch. I was intrigued by the watermelon tuna - chef did a great job of creating this cool texture and marinating it to practically mimick tuna. Really enjoyed it.I'd return - I wouldn't say I'd rush over and run red lights for happy hour because the cost difference is only like $3 but if it fits your schedule why not. Seems dope for a club evening but not sure they'd play the music I enjoy (r&b, rap, dancehall - I could be wrong)"

Only one person in our group even tried the shrimp and then avoided the remainder. Meatballs were just edible. Overall, the appetizers were horrible.   Lobster bisque: excellent and had a little cayenne pepper kick to it.  Entrees: I had the miso sea bass, and it was perfect.

Just mediocre.Service: averageAmbiance: mildly classy and pleasantOverall cleanliness: averageBathroom cleanliness: below average with trash all over the floor.Misc: live piano music inside was a nice touch.",
      "Skip the steak. The stoned crabs are amazing.  Very sweet and flavorful. The aioli compliments it well. The ribeye is not so much. Very chewy and not like a prime steak should be. Ordered medium rare and got medium. Nbd if the steak was tender. Flavor of the steak was of dry aged but the quality was lacking. The sides were meh. Got The crab Mac and cheese. Nothing to write home about.Service was excellent. Top notch. I would come back but would stick to the seafood",
      "Delicious, each bite better than the rest! They give you a good portion of seafood too! Staff very friendly and attentive. I would come here if you're looking for a classy ambiance.

      "Went here because I heard they had stone crabs.... And OMG what a great experience. Not only did they have stone crabs that were yummy..... the service was amazing! I don't remember the waitresses name or the manager (lady) who checked on us.... But they were beyond nice. My boyfriend and I had no idea what a gem this place was. From the time we got greeted to the time we paid the check.... We felt royal. The food was phenomenal. Everything was on point. But the service did it for us. I will for sure be back and I am so excited. I got my stone crabs. And my steak was to die for. Love it here .... I'll be back and I'll for sure bring my friends. Loved it. Thank you Trulucks.

      "This was an amazing steak and seafood experience! This was conveniently located near our hotel too! One of our team members highly recommended this restaurant and I can see why. It was a warm evening and our group of 13 was seated in the outdoor patio. We started with the prime meatballs and the shrimp cocktail appetizers. I also had the lobster bisque. My main course was the snow crab claws. The shells were cracked and the crabmeat was easy to remove. For dessert I had the carrot cake--the cream cheese frosting wasn't too sweet and the cake was very moist.I wasn't able to take food pics, other than my crab claws, so you'll have to believe me that the entire meal was delicious from start to finish. The ambience, service and food was excellent. I highly recommend this restaurant.",
      "Never have I ever had lobster mashed potatoes! Came here on a Tuesday afternoon and the food did not disappoint! The rolls were a must along with the lobster mashed potatoes and aSalmon.",
      "Wow, this place is fabulous. Their crabcakes are amazing. Like mostly crab meat and very little breading. Tender and delicious and kind of crunchy on some of the sides. The atmosphere in this location is very traditional and professional. It's unfortunate that the people in Miami have lost the art of getting dressed to go to dinner. There were customers in here that look like they just rolled out of bed next to gentlemen and suits,The service was outstanding, and the rest of the food was truly amazing. I know this is a chain restaurant, but they certainly have it together. If you're in the mood for some delicious seafood, and perhaps a cup of lobster bisque, this is a place worth checking out.",
      "Overall was not impressed with this place. I will start with the positives which is the customer service was great, the ambience was great and it is somewhat of fine dining experience. Our waitress was wonderful and very Informative. I also sat at the bar for a few until my party arrived and I had a very pleasant bar experience as well. The drink taste great but are not that strong.The disappointment In my experience really does come down to the food. Their menu was somewhat limiting to me and Their sides were nothing special. I have a jumbo crabcake for my appetizer and this was actually pretty good and had a lot of juicy crab meat in it... My only complaint was it was super small. I also had the Parmesan bread which wasn't bad but it didn't really taste like Parmesan or anything special. I also had the Caesar salad, if you like garlic then you enjoy this salad but in my opinion there was way too much fresh pressed garlic on the salad, it was overwhelming and nothing on the menu says that it's going to be garlic in it. I also had the meatballs, which was just OK to me. I also had the lobster mac & cheese and the scallops with mashed potatoes. Overall the flavor was just OK, nothing melts in your mouth or had my taste buds excited. I probably wouldn't return and I think there are better options such as Billy Stone crab.",
      "Excellent service! Celebrated a birthday and it was our first time here and we were not disappointed. Ambiance is great. It is on the pricey side but worth it. The dessert was complimentary and very yummy!!"

      "Absolutely love coming here for happy hour or to watch sports. They have a huge indoor space with lots of seating and TVs and a small patio as well. Some of my fav items are the buffalo chicken nachos, entourage cocktail, and sticky chili glaze wings. Great prices and quality food!",
      "If I had to think of one word to describe the food at Batch, it would be \"indulgent.\" The macaroni and cheese is not traditional at all but made with gnocchi, crushed Doritos, Asiago, Gruyère, and other rich cheeses. Undoubtedly, it was the cheesiest mac I have ever had. It was tasty, but I could only eat a few bites. The pizza was also super cheesy, which unfortunately made it very greasy. The beer menu is long, and they have a million screens with every game on.",
      "I joined my friends here after they reserved a table last Saturday so that we can have brunch, enjoy some drinks, and watch the soccer match between Morocco and Portugal. When my friends  arrived, they were denied a regular table and instead were seated in a bar area because the manager was afraid that we were going to stay too long or not spend enough money. I would have walked off after that kind of unnecessary treatment but I was just part of the group and not making decisions for it. Funny that most of the tables ended up being empty. We left right after the game.",
      "I visited this place a few months ago and really forgot to review it. All I remember is that the food was really good and they had this amazing spicy jalapeno drink. Yum!!! I forgot the name but I'm dying to go back for it.",
      "I have been to a few of the Batch Gastro Pub locations and all are very good.  This location downtown/Brickell was no different.  It would be a great place to watch sports if you lived in Brickell.   I had excellent drinks when I was in here with some work colleagues The drinks, whisky, and beer menus are extensive with tons of choices.  They have good food too!  Our server was exceptional and super attentive.  All in all, very good experience.",
      "This was my first time and everything about it was amazing. The food was delicious, the drinks are well-balanced, the service was spectacular and everything about it screams Gastropub. I want to thank Richard for providing one of the best services I ever received as a customer. He was friendly, personable, attentive and knowledgeable about everything on the menu. He truly made our experience at Batch even better. Also the bartender because she knew exactly what she was doing behind the bar. Although this was my first time, the people I came with visited before. They recommend I try the the Batch Attack Burger, which is well worth it. It's everything you want in a burger, juicy, cheesy, smokey, simply an explosion of flavors in your mouth. The Salmon was also well cooked and the bread pudding mouthwatering. Overall, we all had a great time and I highly recommend.",
      "Love this spot for dinner or to watch sports. Like it for brunch, but wouldn't be my top choice.Came during a big heat game and it was packed due to having TVs all over. Online reservations available and I suggest you use them. We found bar seating and had dinner and were pleasantly surprised by the range of options and the quality. Shout out to the delicious goat cheese pizza!Came back for brunch and not too crowded. Patio setup is nice. Brunch food missed the mark for me though. Nothing was that flavorful and the texture on the hash needed more crunch. Shared this and a chia pudding and left hungry and unsatisfied despite paying $15-20 per dish.Basically, a good option depending on the occasion. They have various specials for different times of week and day and it's definitely worth checking out at some points, just not others.",
      "One of the king of Gastropubs has to be batch!!!! Located in Brickell walks away from city center batch was amazing.  Im so huge on service in the hospitality industry and Batch customer service was hands down amazing our server Giovanny was very knowledgeable my go to drink is a whiskey sour or old fashioned and they have a really good pecan whiskey here. I had the batch burger that was one of the best burgers I ever had with  the truffle fries Amazing!!!! My wife had a salad with the chicken wings with the dust on top was a great touch. This place was incredible loved it keep up the great food and service!!!"

      "I am a fan of a good barbecue place- it may be because I am from the South, and I am always looking for a good place where I can enjoy some meat and protein.Luckily for me, I found Society BBQ after a recommendation from a friend and found my way to this place.Society BBQ is the type of place that has good food. I ordered half a pound of fatty brisket, and I was definitely a fan of the meat. It was juicy, tender, and prepared well. The ambiance was very Miami. There was ample room for seating and was very spacious.Overall, I enjoyed Society BBQ. I only wish the prices were one dollar sign less because I am a fan of the mom and pop shop vibe. I am not sure if I would come back here again, but overall a nice place to hang out with friends.",
      "Horrible food . $89 2 baby back ribs . Super spicy for someone has allergies on spice . Don't go there",

      "Society BBQ has been on my list since I saw it on Triple D and boy did it live up to the hype.I'm a sucker for burnt ends and I could not have enjoyed it more. Meat was tender and flavorful. The brisket was great. The sauces were goood.Great staff. Very accommodating and friendly.Great first impression of Miami eats for sure.",
      "They serve Delicious bbq food! They have a nice selection and The place is really cute. I'll be back!",
      "Society bbq is one of my fav bbq places in Miami, chef Richard Hales never misses when it comes to the culinary world! With a few restaurants now open in the midtown Miami area his innovative culinary skills second no one else. The bbq here is tasty, it's well seasoned and well cooked. The pulled pork sandwich was my favorite, the meat was soft and perfectly seasoned, the waffle fries are a great add on. Please visit this restaurant if you want the traditional bbq plates you've been craving. Well recommended!",
      "I've been on a bit of a BBQ kick lately, so decided to finally check out Society. I was a huge fan of Sakaya Kitchen back in the day, so I was really pumped to try this concept from Grateful Hospitality.First things first, this place IS pricey. Probably pricier than other BBQ spots in the area. BUT, the portions are HUGE. My boo and I both had leftovers and shared each of our sides, so definitely go into it thinking that.I got the \"fatty\" brisket (1/2 pound serving), which... could've been fattier. Some of the pieces weren't as tender as I would've hoped, but still great flavor. The smoked mac & cheese was PHENOM - so creamy and a must-have. The heirloom cornbread with Florida honey and butter is a little dry. The honey flavor comes through but this one is skippable. My boo loved his pulled pork sandwich, and the waffle fries that it comes with were also standouts.We shared the smoked bourbon bread pudding, which was veeeeeery sweet but delish. In fact, when I asked what I should have between the bread pudding and banana pudding, the person taking my order asked me how big my sweet tooth was.The service was great - very kind and speedy. I'd pop back in for a quick bite while in Midtown or for some takeout in a pinch.Ah, and since I can't write a review and not mention parking - there's plenty of street parking or the Midtown garage.",
      "Some mixed reviews, but i figured i would give it a try. Ordered the burnt ends, pulled pork and chicken sandwiches, mac&cheese and dessert.My overall impression is that everything is super sweet. Honestly it feels like eating a spoonful of sugar with each bite. At the price point they are asking for (almost $20 per item), it needs major improvement. The burnt ends are a saucy mess and you can barely taste the meat. The few bites that i could taste anything other than sweet do hint at the possibility of quality meat. The bread pudding is only thing that saves this place from 1 star. In such a high foot traffic area Im shocked they can get away with the lack of quality.",
      "We go to The Citadel quite often but tried the Midtown store.  The pulled chicken sandwich which was awesome especially with the Texas sauce.  The Smokey Mac and Cheese was world class.  The only disappointment was the Brisket burnt ends sandwich.  The meat was overcooked and dry.  We will try the Citadel store next.  BTW the beer was cold!"

The chicken and waffles was spectacular! Take a look at these pictures. I would recommend this for breakfast 5/5 times and I will be returning to try a different dish on the menu !",
      "iKrave will forever get my business!!!The BEST shrimp and grits I've ate in my life! Between the freshness of the shrimp and the sauce that accompanies the grits, I was already sleepy before I finished it. 10/10 stars cuz that was AMAZING",
      "Tried their Oxtail and Grits, because I love Oxtails and I love Shrimp and Grits. At first I wasn't sure if it was giving me what it needed to. but once I added some of there hot sauce which reminds me of if Texas Pete and Louisiana hot had a baby btw! it was amazing! Also I was able to try the fried pork chops and greens all were winners! Def coming back. Pork chop was flavorful and tender. greens were seasoned well with just that right tang of vinegar. The pics are not in the restaurant actually as we took it to go.",
      "My partner and I visited during a long layover as the spot is not far from the airport. The restaurant itself is small and seats less than 20 ppl if I had to guess. The staff was friendly and let us take our time ordering. They offer dine in, delivery, and carry out. The oxtails absolutely walked on water! They were served with creamy cheese grits and were seasoned and piping hot. We also had the fried conch and fried snapper with macaroni. Everything was delicious and I can't forget the light and refreshing watermelon drink that was like a flavored lemonade.  The server, Quinisha, even helped us navigate the city during our short stay. I highly recommend this place for some authentic soul food and I hope I can return again, really soon",
      "Oxtail with rice Meal (pick 2 sides)Collard greens, macaroni and cheese, oxtails, rice with beans. The entire meal was delicious! I don't know how they seasoned those greens but I'm sure Jesus was in there helping to cook them.",
      "Chicken is insanely crispy, tasty, cooked perfectly. The macaroni and cheese surprisingly had peppers in it. The green beans were mush and oddly vinegary. But the collard greens...holy hell those were the best I have ever tasted. Flavor, crispness and the meat inside those collard greens melted in your mouth. I would order this again. They have a lot of choices for side dishes so I will be exploring other options!",
      "Great!! Everything was delicious and they were very nice and gave us good recommendations. Will visit again when in Miami.",
      "The new location looks great! The people are beautiful and nice. They are close to 3 other chicken spots, but IKrave has an nice casual restaurant feel. You can dine in unlike their competition. I would recommend some healthy light options and seasonal items. Overall, really amazed with IKrave new location",
      "Took me to the old ikrave which was a inconvenience because I took a Uber then had to get another one to the new location. Food wise it was Delicious ! Very good  drinks was over priced I think it should be free refills for $4 a cup ijs",
      "The food is delish (even though they didn't have my shrimp so I couldn't get my usual shrimp and grits) however my husband ordered the grill pork chops, grits w/cheese and egg whites and I ordered the salmon croquettes, grits and egg whites. Our meal was tasty, it never disappoints. Although our waitress was nice, my husband and I along with other customers were a tad confused w/the self seating and greeting/assertiveness from staff. The interior of the restaurant is modern, inviting, neat and clean.  This little hidden gem  will forever be my fave go to restaurant for creamy grits, and shrimp."

      "Something that makes me proud to call Miami/South Florida home is how essential representation is to the culture and there's no better way to hone in on that representation than cuisine. In all my time spent in South Florida, I am surprised it took me this long to try out this staple of Caribbean cooking. Naomi's sits just outside of the vibrant neighborhood of Little Haiti and represents it well. Naomi's has always been on my list of must-try spots whenever I trek back home and this time I was finally able to give it a shot.Haitian food and culture have always had a place in my heart due to my time working with many Haitians in the food service industry. They just take you in as one of your own and make you feel at home. This is how it felt to eat the food at Naomi's Garden.The flavorful meats from baked chicken, fried turkey, and curry goat. The sides whether it's rice and peas, legume, collard greens, or fried plantain; are all great choices. I honestly could've done a plate of just side dishes. And please do yourself a favor and order extra pikliz. I could buy Naomi's pikliz by the jar. Equal parts fresh, tangy and spicy. You'll need the extra side of them to eat with every bite.My favorite part of the visit to Naomi's was getting to chat with Noam, as seen on Netflix's Street Food: USA - Miami, whose family founded and runs Naomi's since the 70s. He really took the time to hear my wife and I's story and just made us feel even more at home. It made our time spent at Naomi's special and I hope your visit goes the same.",
      "I really do not enjoy negative feedback but I think it's necessary for the consumers and management to know when things are not satisfactory. First off, I know that you scan the QR code and order from the table but there was no acknowledgement of our prescience whatsoever. We took a while to order because we could not decide and it would have been helpful to get some suggestions or explanations.  We ordered the curry chicken with white rice and black beans ... it was ok, the chicken was flavorful but nothing crazy and the beans were very watery, I get that they are puréed and didn't expect a tal beans but this was like just watery. Also got the ox tail with rice and peas... the rice was good but barely any beans at all. The ox tail was not great at all...I mean it had flavor but it was not tender and just not right at all. I also ordered the fried snapper with fried green plantains ... this was bad. The fish was not fresh at all and it was dry and stuff it even came kinda warm. The plantains were also stiff and old. Just overall very disappointing. Even when we got the food it was just left at the table, no one came to check in or ask if we needed anything else. I feel the place has potential, the garden is kinda nice but very unkept. But if the food was good it would be worth it. It was an unfortunate experience and to top of off it was actually really pricey. And no one to give any feedback regarding the food or experience.",
      "Came to a Color of Change volunteer event here today (MLK Day) \"Serve Our Sisters Miami\" and had a wonderful time. The garden in \"Naomi's Garden\" is a lovely & lush area in the back where you are able to take your food after ordering at their ventanita. As we waited fir the event to begin, we were approached by Noam, the super friendly son of the founders & current manager who told us all about the history of Naomi's and even pointing out a spot in the garden that used to be where his parents bedroom was (their house was on the property before it was converted!). We were delighted to find out the organizers had arranged for us to have lunch after we worked. I tried the Rice & Peas, Plantains, Legumes, Jerk Chicken, Fried Grouper, Pickelies (the spicy slaw) & a fresh Passion Fruit Juice. Everything was delicious & super flavourful. Because so many people showed up to volunteer (YAY!) the food portions were small & I was left wanting more! As we were leaving, I planned to order food to take home but the line was crazy long. Will definitely be back as there are so many things I want to try. Really cool vibe in this place!",
      "The best Haitian food I've had in Miami. I love they they have JouMou on sundays. I'm trying to venture out on the menu but the freedom soup is my favorite.They have a lot of options. Mostly Haitian food, caribbean food, & some soul food sides & things as well. This place never disappoints.",
      "My second year in a row coming here for the freedom soup (JouMou). I bought the regular JouMou & the vegan option for later. Both taste amazing. The vegan one was tasty without the meat, so I'll definitely just get a large of that next year.The lines were constant, but flowed quickly. Everyone was raving about how good their food is, & I too am a proud repeat customer. Happy Haitian Independence Day, enjoy the freedom soup.",
      "I came here for the soup jou mou, & because I wanted to try the vegan option (I'm curious & greedy). The food is freshly made, & they use mostly fresh ingredients. My food was so flavorful & tasty. This place is a gem, slightly hidden in Little Haiti.",
      "Delicious food. Huge portions. I had the jerk chicken with rice and peas and collard greens ($10.5). The place had a really nice casual vibe to it and the outdoor space was lovely and could imagine some pretty cool live performances having in there (which my friend I went with said they do have just not the night we were there)Customer service wasn't bad, but it was a little confusing if we sat down in the courtyard if we would be served or had to order at the window outfront. Fortunately I went with a Haitian friend who was able to help me get things sorted out as we ordered.",
      "Years ago I lived in Haiti, so I wanted some Haitian food while visiting Miami.  I ran across Naomi's and decided to visit based on the reviews.  It didn't disappoint!I had the Goat curry with rice and beans and the Mac and cheese.  The portion was huge and it was all delicious,The seating area is a covered outdoor area and I LOVED that there were chickens running around.  The space and the area, I felt like I was back in the homeland.",
      "Sak PaseI'm going to do this in Spanish for my Latino folks. Your food is amazing.Creciendo en Miami viví en Little Haiti. Y a pesar de muchos años ahi, nunca pude encontrar esta belleza de restaurante que se me dio la oportunidad de conocer ahora! Compré un Macaroni au gratin pa la dieta (Haha), y ya! Eso es lo que recuerdo comer en la casa de mi amigo haitiano. Fue el plato recomendado, el plato de la noche. Pues pa' que digo más. Los invito a que disfruten de la buena comida Caribeña apoyando los negocios pequeños en Miami. Salud y Vida!",
      "Good food and a plethora of vegetarian options. I had the vegan sampler. The jerk jackfruit was my favorite of this. Crazy how chicken-like it is!It's an order at the counter sorta deal, or you can order at the table if eating in their garden area. They also have order online options, which seems nice because the line moved a little on the slower side.Big portion sizes. We probably could have split one plate between two people and still had a few leftovers.",
      "Oh boy, if I had a Haitian grandma, I'd imagine it would be similar to the food served here - huge portions make sure you're stuffed to the brim (I dare you to finish all this in one sitting...), cheap and super flavorful. Whatever you order, you probably won't regret. The jerk chicken is delicious - smoky, spicy, juicy, grilled to perfection. It has flair and flavor for sure. The rice and peas is also surprisingly delicious - I guess I wasn't sure what to expect but they are intensely flavorful. Sweet plantains are also a good compliment to all the other flavors. My wife got a fried grouper - massive piece of moist, flaky white fish with a delicate fry to it, collard greens, which help cut the grease and some fried plantains, which honestly might not be the best togo item to choose since it gets a bit soggy, but I imagine they're great fresh at the restaurant.I would love to come back to try the rest of the menu!",
      "Amazing food and a Jamaican place that you can go vegetarian. I had of course the ox tail and WOW SLAMMMMMMIN! Super nice workers gave me a taste of the jerk jackfruit and next time i go im definitely ordering it! It was my favorites for sure. And of course i ordered a side of the jerk chicken and once again SLAMMMMIN! Big portion sizes and had the rice and peas, cabbage, etc. but i do recommend to get one plate between two people unless you can eat eat LOL! Great little back patio area parking was easy as well. I will be back!"

      "I am in Miami for a conference and of course, wanted to visit Calle 8. There was an opportunity to go on Tuesday after work and I wondered if there would be a place to celebrate Taco Tuesday. Some friends recommended El Santo. As we approached the counter we could see signs for several weekly specials and there was one for Taco Tuesday. \"Tres Por Dos\" (Three for Two). The sign doesn't say but carne asada is not included. It was a bit hard to understand what the young lady at the register was saying. Although the music is nice it was a bit loud at the counter. She seems nice but intense, which threw me off for a bit. I ordered two Mojo (Pollo) Marinated, Onions, Pico De Gallo, Mexican Slaw, Mild Habanero Sauce. Served with Four tortilla and topped with cilantro and one Beer Battered Fish, Pico de Gallo, Mexican Slaw, Onions, Chipotle Vinaigrette, I think they were $4 each  There are a variety of drinks, I ordered a Jarritos. It's a great place to stop and enjoy the ambiance, the feel of Little Habana and the eye candy. The only reason I gave it four stars is because I felt the tortillas could stand to be on the grill a bit longer. I don't like soggy tortillas and I could have used a spicier salsa. Other than that totally worth the stop!!!",
      "Set in the touristy heart of Calle Ocho by galleries of Viernes Culturales, El Santo Taqueria provides a spot to satisfy your taco cravings. It's supposedly owned by the same group that runs Kiki and Gramercy; I believe there's even a speakeasy lounge to Santo but my experience was average.The logistics are that you order at the counter, and the food is brought to your table. I started with a generic bottle of white wine (Seaglass?) and ordered both chips and salsa, as well as their el pastor pork burrito. The wine was chilled and a little dry, so no big complaints. Likewise, the chips had a good crisp, and the salsa a mild bite. However, unlike how it used to be, the chips aren't complementary. My main was their Burrito al Pastor, and I will admit it had a nice amount of pork and fixings in it.",
      "There's limited parking on the streets, but they also have a parking lot in the back. Service was not as efficient as I wanted. It was actually slow. The food was delicious, but it took a long time for us to get it.",
      "If I could give O starts I would. Actually, the frozen mojitois the only thing that gets a star in my opinion.We were visiting Miami and decided to stop by this placebecause I had been here before for drinks with my familyand liked the vibes. Well three years later.... I wanted tostop by again but we decided to get food this time. VeryVery different experience.The tacos were absolutely boring and BLAH!!!!!!! Not goodat all. We ordered chicken and el pastor because carneasada (steak) is not included in the Taco Tuesday Deal LOL(B2G1) mind you, it doesn't say anything on the menu andthe male bartender simply forgot to mention this to us until I specifically said \"we're doing the Taco Tuesday Deal\".  Tuesday, 9/20/22 male bartender also failed to giveus silverware and napkins the ENTIRE time we were there. He literally watched us grab TINY DRINK napkins from the bar but didn't bother giving us any. My boyfriend also asked the male bartender for some salsa, which he then replied \"like hot sauce? We have some spicy Mayo \" and gives us no salsa for our \"nachos\" which my boyfriend enjoys and it's a Mexican restaurant. As we look at the menu and read the item \"chips and salsa\" we become even confused as to why he acted liked they had no salsa. Some time goes by we turn around looking at the masks on the wall behind us and notice a table with extra salsa ... on the side.... The nachos, were absolutely TRASH. Extremely small amount, extra $6 for steak... and let me tell you, THERE WAS NO STEAK. Or it was like ground beef \"steak\" I don't know what it was but sure wasn't any steak.It was the worst nachos we've EVER had. The elote wasliterally TASTELESS. How do you manage to mess up cornin Mayo & cheese.... Is beyond me. Overall we had ahorrible experience and the food was gross and gave usMAJOR STOMACH ACHES. The two shot tequila platterthing was cool. But will never go back. Maybe for a frozenmojito because it's B1G1 2PM-6PM but NEEEEEVER EVEREVER EVER going back for food nor the service.Oh, also 15% was charged for a service fee but the service was NOT GOOD, AT ALL. Like there was NO SERVICE. UGGHH, so extremely annoyed with this place. Ruined our night.",
      "Great casual happy hour spot! Unfortunately we were already full so we didn't get to order any food. This spot is right on the main streets of Little Havana and offers some great ice cold drinks. Tables are self seated and you order your drinks at the counter. We stopped by after seeing someone with one of these drinks. Not disappointed at all! They get additional stars bc you can lowkey take these out with you",
      "Stopped here for some small bites and frozen drinks while walking around Calle Ocho. One of the better places for drink prices on the street, and the bartenders are quick and friendly. I highly recommend even if you are grabbing your drinks \"to go\".",
      "Fast service and really good margaritas! I came on a Monday night and it wasn't busy. Located right in the middle of the nightlife of Calle 8. Will come back again and try other things on the menu.",
      "We wanted to save time and chose this place because they looked very vacant and like a faster food place; we would have much preferred to go to a \"real\" restaurant. The food came in 45 minutes. The staff kept working on take-out orders and only after we reminded them about us they brought us chips and salsa. A disappointing experience.",
      "As a Yelper I often fall into the trap of not going some place with less than 4 stars, but I'm glad I pushed myself past the discomfort with that yellow star color and gave this spot a shot to decide for myself! First, you can't help but get swept up in the immersive and intricate interior decor of the restaurant. From the little touches like the beautiful, colored and patterned tiling on the walls to the bigger swings of Luchadore heads and devilish cathedral motifs (the bathroom is labeled \"Confession\"), I was very entertained by the creativity and snarky humor on display. As for the food, I was able to eat the \"Veggie Taco\" and found the sweet potato base and assorted peppers a great combo. The white corn tortilla adds an additional subtle flavor in the background. The green salsas on top round out the flavors nicely. The \"Elote Bowl\" was so good! Tangy and cheesy, it tasted fresh and came out fast!",
      "Been seeing this place for the past 5-6 years, and being from SoCal, I'm normally skeptical when considering a new taco shop/restaurant. After an evening at Ball and Chain, we decided to finally give this place a try. It was an extreme disappointment when it came to the food. The ambiance is cool, you'll see luchadores masks on the wall, fill with their images and dia de los muertos decorations. Back to the food, we order the 1 LB Burro with carne asada. They should just disclose, it will be 1 lb of rice, with ta few strands of meat, because that's what it was. Even then, 1lb, is an overstatement, the burrito is tiny, Chipotle burritos are bigger in size and flavor. It was bland/plain and overpriced. Needless to say, I have not been missing anything for the past 5-6 years. Sad, because I love a good Mexican meal."

This is a great spot for a late night snack after a Marlins' game (it's also a lot less expensive than the food at the stadium- tacos are like $2 each). I like the Mexican vibe, which is hard to find in Miami.

      "Quesadillas, tacos, elote and tortas are so freaking good. My go to is the chorizo quesadilla. They're affordable and open late. Recommend over Taco Bell any day",
      "My friend and I were looking for a taqueria, we went to one in calle 8 but it was closed, I did my Yelp search and we ended up here. There was a huge line when we first arrived. I was a little confused about the \"line\" because there was none but there were about 20 people outside waiting for their order. So, even though I was there, I decided to call and place my order to make it easier for me. I suggest you to call 10-15 mins prior arriving, it makes the job easier for them and you as well. They prepare stuff quick, after 15 mins the place looked empty. I got tacos de pollo and also tacos de chorizo, an elote and a pepsi. Those tacos though. First, all the stuff that they put on top tastes fresh. The chicken and chorizo were both well seasoned. If I go back, I will go with the chorizo ones instead of chicken. The chorizo flavor along with the stuff they put on top (onions, cilantro, pico de gallo and pepino) makes it rich in flavor. The elote was also amazing. The corn itself was soft and the sour cream and cheese make a great combination. I totally recommend it. I will be back for sure. The value that you get in comparison to the price you pay makes it a bargain.",
      "Que lugar tan chingon . Edwin es súper buena onda y te atiende muy bien . La comida súper buena, el servicio excellente , y son muy amables . Neta que tienen que comer Aki .",
      "Amazing service and the food is awesome. Everything I'm craving tacos I go here because they are the best in town. I love them"

      "I ate here over the weekend and the service was outstanding! We were seated immediately upon arrival, and given bread and oil as soon as we sat. I tried the prosciutto burrata appetizer, and it was mouth watering! It wasn't too heavy, and came with colorful fresh tomatoes hidden under the flatbread, which made me feel slightly less unhealthy!!For main dishes, we both ordered the cacio de pepe, which was honestly so so GOOD!! The black truffle was the perfect accompaniment to this dish! I'm so glad I had some leftovers to take home with me!5 stars!",
      "JUST OK.Came in on Thursday night and the restaurant was empty! Very difficult to find parking. Alot of the streets are residential and permit required.Made reservations for my bday and that wasn't acknowledged at all. Just as someone else had mentioned about there wedding anniversary. Very odd.We ordered a Caesar salad to start and it was ok nothing special. Thought they would offer pepper on there salads because it seemed like that type of place but they did not. They brought me a small ramekin of cheap pepper.The Black Linguini Con Granchio was amazing the star of the show. So delicious and flavorful. As for the Tagolini \"Cacio E Pepe\" that people rave about it was sooo salty and had no pepper flavor.Service was attentive but not personable all business. ;(Will not be back",
      "Came here to celebrate my friend's birthday and to check out Palat for the first time. We went with the Miami Spice 2022 menu for dinner. Three courses for $45. Lots of options to choose from and the portions were more than generous. Service was impeccable! Very friendly,and attentive staff.",
      "Great service and food. Beautiful presentation of food. We felt like we were in the Mediterranean. Will return again and again!",
      "My wife and I thought this place opened up at 11, so we stopped by around  11:30 and  it was closed. They still let us in and got us water and a glass of wine while we waited for the kitchen to open. Everyone was super friendly and the natural floral decor was Beautiful. Food was delicious and the  panacotta was amazing. Our waiter Marcos noticed we were looking for shoes and gave us a great recommendation  for a local shop that we checked out right after. Super happy with this place and will be back",
      "Great Italian restaurant with amazing pasta and burrata, seafood and steaks.  Have admit they have a good menu for all. Excellent wine selection.  Awesome for groups.",
      "I finally had an opportunity to try this place and was not disappointed. We came in a big group for lunch and ordered family style (the plates are large). We tried the octopus, branzino, garden salad with chicken, caccio e pepe, and the appetizer special which was an assortment of raw fish including branzino, salmon, and tuna. The caccio e pepe was delicious and the perfect plate to share across a group of 5, allowing everyone to order another entree as well . The branzino was also very tasty. The raw fish was good but not our favorite part of the meal. The restaurant itself is nicely decorated inside, but we chose to sit outside as the day was not too hot and there was plenty of shade. I can see the restaurant having more romantic vibes for dinner, making it a nice option for a date.",
      "My friend and I went to Palat for lunch a few weeks ago, for Miami Spice. We were both excited about trying it since we'd heard such good things. The spice is bright and inviting, despite the gloomy weather outside. To start, we shared the EGGPLANT CROSTINI and the GRILLED OCTOPUS. The octopus was pretty good, but the crostini wasn't so much a crostini as it was a piece of barely toasted bread with some eggplant smeared on top. That appetizer wasn't tasty at all. We were disappointed.For our entrees, we had the LASAGNA and the TAGLIOLINI CACIO & PEPE. The lasagna was very good. The tagliolini was excellent.For our desserts, we shared the CHOCOLATE TEMPTATION and the RICOTTA CHEESECAKE. The cheesecake was very very good, but the chocolate temptation stole the show. After lunch we had coffee, which was good. I think they serve Kimbo.The service at Palat was good. Although they seemed a little overwhelmed, they were eager to please.",
      "Nice restaurant. Foods are perfect.Good services.They don't have parking but you can park on the street.",
      "A group of us went there for our Holiday dinner last night. Waited for almost every single thing too long. Menus came late, waiter was MIA, the food itself was subpar not as good as I have heard it would be. Half of us ordered cacio Pepe w truffle and it came cold and lumpy. Wasn't done well. The appetizers were good. Overall we waited way too long for everything, menus, wine, waters, entrees. We paid a ton for a mediocre dinner."

      "BEST TACOS IN TOWN! I've gone to all of their locations, from their food truck to the first storefront location in Miramar. The art on their walls at all locations is so cool and catchy to the eye of social media. I love that you have the option to enter your order and customize it to your liking with their self check out kiosks. This is perfect because you enter your order and don't have to worry that someone entered your order incorrectly. Their food is delicious, and I love how creative they are with all the different dishes they come up with. This location in Wynwood is a fantastic addition to their other either existing locations. From their Birria Tacos, Ramen, Elote, and more. Their food is also halal.",
      "Enjoyed the tacos.  We tried the beef, chicken, and bang bang shrimp.  I had the beef and the chicken.  I liked the crunch on the corn tortilla shell.  The chicken taco had pickled onions which I loved.  The bang bang shrimp tacos got rave reviews (but, I didn't have one).  The atmosphere goes with the area vibe (graffiti).  Ordering is where you enter your order into a screen, and someone brings it to you.  No human interaction, so you need to know what you want.  Our food came in a reasonable amount of time.  There is indoor and outdoor seating.  In would definitely come back for more tacos.",

      "Surprisingly disappointing. Pretty bland and flavorless birria tacos and sweet plantains. After waiting for over 45 minutes I expected better. Also very difficult to ask about wait times and allergies given the staff is hidden behind curtains in the back. Ambiance wasn't bad, and limited outdoor seating available. Lots of gluten free options available (including the birria tacos shown below)",

      "This is the newest location of Talkin Tacos in Miami right in the heart of Wynwood. Of course, the food and service didn't disappoint. Same ordering process. Just walk up to the iPad like stand and then select your food and drinks then minutes later, a server will bring your food to your table. Everything they serve here is phenomenal from the Elote, tacos, birria and quesadillas. My favorites are still the original birria tacos, quesa birria and the bang bang shrimp tacos. I'm telling you. These will fill you up and keep wanting more. One thing that really stands out about this place is that they don't skimp on the protein. The tacos are meaty and very flavorful. The shrimps are plump and have a nice crunch. They're simply fantas-taco!  Love this place and will keep coming back for more.",
      "So I first was introduced to talkin tacos when it was a food truck and now I'm beyond happy they have a new location open up in wynwood,next to one of my favorite bars (Gramps). Their food continues to blow it out of the water! Their birria quesadilla is definitely my go to, because of my love for cheese, but everything, and I mean everything, on their menu is amazing! Their bang bang shrimp tacos, their street corn, all of it. The ordering process is also so convenient. You order through a kiosk. Simple and streamlined. I dig it! The vibe is also something to note! It's so colorful and fun, and I like that they have a couple of arcade games too LOL. Can't wait to go back!",
      "Came across this place from yelp and immediately knew I had to come try it out! When I arrived I thought the place was closed because it was so empty inside, but I was assured on the phone they were open. You order at an order kiosk and sit down to wait for your food. This place is 100% cashless. I ordered the pick 3 tacos, the shrimp, steak and birria tacos. My girlfriend ordered the loaded steak nachos. Upon receiving my food I was already in love. Everything looked so delicious. The birria taco was one for the books for me, I will most definitely return just to have it again. The loaded nachos were so good and loaded with toppings, between the both of us we could not finish eating it all. We both loved it and can't wait to return for more.",
      "Im not saying the food is awesome, but it kinda is so I'm just gonna say it!I LOVED their steak and I'm obsessed with the rice bowl. I'm also pretty into their churros cause you can't possibly skip dessert!The vibes are just right and it's located perfect for those looking to grab a bite at the end of the night or just order a grab and go. They also have outside seating if you're a people watcher like me!"

      "What an amazing spot, we absolutely LOVED it. It's fairly young and trendy, so I would not take my baby boomer parents here (or a baby in general)- but for a younger, fun, lively crowd, this is perfect. The inside is really cool - lots of artwork, somewhat hidden restaurant, similar to a speakeasy. The drinks were unique and incredible and the food was OUTSTANDING! Very gastronomic - if you're into that sort of thing (my parents wouldn't get it). We basically ordered the entire menu, until we nearly exploded. Here were a few memorable plates (as in, those I can remember after imbibing for a few hours)...Spanglish milk bread - the black salt on top. WOW. They say, once you go black (salt), you never go back right? Exactly. The guava butter was unlike any butter I have ever had. It's very tropical, and fruity! Wagyu beef ravioli - that blue cheese sauce was to die for - take some of that milk bread and drunk your bread in this sauce to your heart's desire (and worry about the consequences later, because bread and cheese, whew!) Nitro Watermelon Tataki - the only remotely healthy thing that entered our mouths at dinner. It's such a cool fish - watermelon, pomegranate seeds, toasted pumpkin seeds, olive oil and a total flavor overload. Not to mention the fact that the fish came out looking like sashimi grade tuna. So cool. Arroz Mamposteado - this was a cool fish. It was rice and beans, but mixed with avocado creme and and pork belly and chips. Incredible. I'm not much of a dessert but holy smokes did we devour the suspiro. I'm quite positive I licked the jar towards the end of the evening - don't judge me. I wish I could remember what cocktail I had, but the choices are all so unique and fun, I should have tried them all. Eh, gives me a reason to go back, right?!",
      "Thank you so much for the kind words and the detailed review of all of our dishes, Shannon.  It was a pleasure hosting you, and we look forward to your next visit!",
      "Obsessed is an understatement.Found this place on Yelp (I love you Yelp!) and with the rating and images I knew I was SOLD. The show stopping, craft cocktails is what I came for and I wasn't sure what to expect once we came. Was it a hype? Would I be disappointed? Who cares! You're in Miami and going to a Spanglish cocktail bar. We didn't make reservations but we did read it wasn't too hard to get in. And it was exactly just that. Came here at around 9:30 pm on a Saturday night and we were seated to the side entrance table with couches right away. It wasn't a good option for dining but we literally only came here for the cocktails so it was perfect!The vibe check in this place was everything. There was a live dj tucked in to the side making sure the music was on point. And it was!On to the craft cocktails:I ordered the Pornstar Mejican@ and it was delicious wish the mezcal was more of the star of the show and to be honest, given that everyone else's cocktails were truthfully visually so pleasing wish the presentation for this one was as well but that's totally ok!!! I still loved my experience. My hubby ordered the Cafetera Old Fashioned and WOW. What a presentation and fun way to serve it with an actual cafetera. It was definitely a show stopper. The Caipirinha Frizá was delicious and very unique as well and the Paparazzi came served in a photo lens so that was pretty cool!We loved Spanglish, would be back in a heart beat. Overall great vibes for cocktails and pretty cool presentation that really makes this place stand out. Excited to try their food next time!",
      "This place gives my New York Vibes OD! It's definitely giving New York Speakeasy Vibes. You'll probably miss it if your not paying attention because the sign outside is only a neon bottle sign. Inside is intimate with the cutest decor, low key, playing all the classic jams. I love a place that sets a vibe with an good playlist! Okayyy! We came for drinks after dinner, so we didn't order food but they did have a menu. All the drinks we ordered were sooo freakin good, and were in creative instagram worthy cups. This is definitely going to be my new hideaway spot. Service was amazing! Will be coming back!",
      "Okay, here's the thing with this place, it's so freaking loud that you can barely hear the person next to you, it's impossible to have any sort of conversation with a large group of people. The food was okay and drinks were pretty good on the other hand, so I think this is a good place for dates, just not a large gathering.",
      "Hi Anton, thank you so much for taking the time to share your experience at Spanglish.  We apologize for the music being too loud, and this is something we’re going to adjust.  Although, we’re happy to hear you enjoyed the drinks!We hope to see you again soon!",
      "What an awesome chic place.  Amazing craft cocktail & gastro pub style tapas.

      "The entrance to Spanglish is so subtle that it's easy to miss! Once you enter, the ambiance is cozy, intimate, and welcoming. We came because of the happy hour -- their cocktails were $9 and some small dishes were marked down! We ordered a round of the caipirinhas first and sadly were a bit disappointed, it was way more tart than expected and just tasted like lemon juice. The Chilcano tasted similar with the overpowering citrus. The Spanglish mule was way better! For small plates, we ordered the octopus croquettes, Caribbean dumplings, and a side of yuca. The octopus croquettes were my favorite of the items we ordered -- crispy, served hot, and the octopus inside was tender. The Caribbean dumplings were a little mushy, and the yuca was a bit tough and the sauce it was served with tasted like Big Mac sauce which I am not a fan of. Everything came out pretty fast, though!",
      "Finally got to visit Spanglish and let's just say I fell in love! I came here for happy hour with a friend and honestly we were blown away by how delicious everything was. We ordered the Spanish Milk Bread, Timba Frita, Queso E' Craba , and Tuna Tostadas. My favorite dish we tried was the Timbra Frita. It was the perfect bite full of flavor. We also ordered cocktails. We both ordered the Paparazzi which honestly tasted amazing but the presentation was killer. It comes served in a camera lens. Overall this place is a vibe. The music was lit. They were playing bad bunny. The artwork is awesome. I definitely see myself coming back here.",
      "Location a bit hidden in plain sight, so be sure to stop and read signs. Small  and intimate setting with a great ambiance for drinks and light bites with friends. The food was ok nothing over the top or extraordinary. I did like my margarita with the seafood bites. Drinks here before a walk around in Wynwood is never a bad idea.",
      "This place has no sign in front. We drive up and down and finally found it. Outside looks like it was closed. Nothing indicating it was opened except for a sign out front that shows menu of the day. We walked it and surprisingly was like wow. This is a cute small cozy restaurant.  The booth I say were pretty close to one another.  The bar area has 6 stools. The food was excellent! Extremely flavorful and so good. The octopus appetizer was amazing. We ordered one of their popular dish and weren't disappointed.  I forgot to photo that dish because I was so hungry.  Everything we had was great including the drinks. We love craft drinks and for sure it was super crafty. The paparazzi drink was so cute. It came in a camera cup and tasted great.I would be definitely coming back here again soon and recommend everyone to try if you haven't been here.",
      "Came here to try a few drinks on a Friday night and it wasn't as busy as I expected. I was able to sit at the bar and watch the bartender make these really cool looking and tasty drinks! The paparazzi was my favorite. Something about the dill and passion fruit combination was something I didn't know I needed. The vuela paloma was just okay, I'm just not the biggest fan of grapefruit. And the cafetera old fashioned tasted like a REALLY strong Cuban coffee, which I really enjoyed. Although the drinks were great, the vibe was kinda ruined by these drunk idiots sitting next to us at the bar, yelling and screaming. But I would still come here again to enjoy a cool curated cocktail."
